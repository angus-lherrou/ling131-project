up for the rights of men women and in this heartbreaking incident children all across America but law suits and engaging over three thousand local attorneys all over America man that\nThat costs a lot of money you can help right now come on we'd been raising money all week\nPaul and the early church you did not used to be a Christian and you certainly did not used to be a Christian author you live you you dove into this thing almost like you believe that\nYeah yeah uh interesting I've always so enjoyed our interviews because you bring up things that no one else does that was one of\nThem when I asked my points now but you know what I Want to know seriously you you you said is on the program before before my listeners people just tuning in how did you you're a lawyer how did you come to faith what happened\nI was a skeptic as you mentioned and but I was a seeker I I always believe in God that I didn't embrace the God of the Bible didn't embrace these is Christ didn't really believe that an all loving God would allow people to suffer a much less a turtle damnation and all that and um\nI finally started studying it reading apologetic books\nPaul Little um you know Josh ... del Norman geyser and finally a overcame my so called intellectual doubts\nAnd then I later place my faith in Christ but I\nI just I I don't understand how anyone can think that there isn't a God I mean Romans one I don't understand you know that you look at the creation you look at the I look at everything I Know the Senate can point poke holes and all of that but if they have an open mind they will understand\nBut but embracing the Bible was a little difficult than what I didn't realize is that people had placed seeds in my path all along when I didn't realize it until after I became a believer little things that if they hadn't happened if God and it's Providence hadn't put people in my path dropping those seats I may not have the ...\nChristian of course I was always destined to be one because God I don't I'm not as you could you believe in their predestination garden I actually don't but I don't even know what I whatever I Want to get into\nThat but but seriously you know I I just want to see how how you were raised because how many how many uh kids were in your family just rushing us\nJust un Russell [laughter] can I call him Russ Russ un Russ where they were just two kids know how many years apart are you to have you now this is the honest have you always been two years apart yes\nIt's amazing you see that's very rare it is that's very very rare of fluids just that it was just the two boys ... you're like me and my brother we're we're about two years apart and\nUh I guess my question is did you go to any kind of church on Sunday oh yeah yeah we were raised a Methodist Church in what in what a part of the state what part of the country southeast Missouri okay so you went to church so you didn't think it was a bunch of bologna\nNo no no no and my parents were Christian and I I I just not like I was cynical about it I just I had trouble with it I didn't understand how it was fair and all that\nBut but what I was going to tell you a minute ago when you so rudely cut me yes I always try to cut people up rudely otherwise what's the point yeah but what was that I hadn't really given the chance it's like okay so I'm passing judgment on a thing that affects my eternal life\nMight turn a turtle destiny with without having examine that for myself when I did examine it I was amazed at what I've found Web but that's but that's quite recently right yeah well no no no twenty five years ago but I didn't ... but it's still quite ... you're a kid\nRight so you're a little bit like me in the sense that you were really were absolutely an adult before you really looked in above void where'd you go to college I'm a zoo ... yes and then you went to to law school at the zoo Atmeh zoo and then you leaped into a career as a lawyer what kind of law where you practicing all this time\nA general practitioner until I got an entertainment law with the luck of having my brother who asked me to do the contracts and various other people whose names I won't mention wouldn't it\nBe great to have a brother who was a lawyer yeah my name or rush and I had a brother like you uh I probably would be a lot richer today\nActually I probably would have some money but let me ask you that you're a lawyer you're moving along in life as an adult you get married you have kids but at what point did something happened where you said I Need to know is God we'll I guess I'm I'm guessing you around and you know late thirties or something\nIt probably mid thirties and and my wife was a Christian I Can't believe she married me\nWhy would you marry you know we're not supposed to be an equally yoked so your wife send by marrying\nYou totally incredible yeah and uh but but she was patient and she feels she said she always knew I Would become a Christian um but but I\nI really did uh I went to this prayer breakfast where\nOr when I Can't remember the St Louis cardinals pitcher was speaking and gave an impassioned speech that that really didn't move me that they left cards at the end of the speech saying if you want to learn more about this sign up and as a Christian men's business conference or whatever it's called\nAnd so we some people call me we haven't got together in a small group we went through this book called the first steps which talked about the authenticity of the Bible or the divinity in\nThe fact that you were willing to go to that see that's interesting 'cause a lot of people lose their main\nI don't want it but you put yourself in that position that yeah that's that's interesting did you have a sense that\nI mean what what were you thinking I'm always curious because I remember my own journey and you try to remember what was in my head [noise] who is in your head at that time did you think this may be true and it's important to I'm going to have a family here I Need to think about this what was going through your head of that time\nUm I I really wanted to believe that but I thought it it it just didn't all the pieces didn't come together\nI thought the Christians were good I didn't ... some of them I thought were ... uh and gold ... off putting blue blue nose school yeah those kinds of ... and those kinda people ought to know that that's not great witness that is\nGreat ... ... more or less than ... yes yes I Know exactly who you're talking about in fact I'll give you their names [laughter] oh man they're the worst the worst yeah\nAnd uh they mean well or not and but but I I just I I wanted so much to leave and I can't wait until I read these things out that make sense it it's got to be true but then then I go back to get back alone no can't be true and uh but then I kept at it and I I really was a pretty Arden seeker and I finally became\nA believer but for yeah because I knew it was urgent but you know when you're younger you think are immortal or at least you don't have any urgency about the end of your life right\nAnd so but I didn't have any those urgency but I just knew it was time to get with it\nIsn't that interesting and ... was this around the time that that you if you had been married at the end yeah did you have any kids yet\nYou know it's interesting though because there are certain people in life you come to a point where you start thinking\n... ... it looks like I'm about to cross the starting line I got to get serious here this is there's it's not just preamble I'm getting out of the race right yes and I I just find it interesting that so here you are an adult and you somehow ... I Can't just\nBelow their along I Can't just stumbled along I actually needed to think about this and figure out whether it's true\nUh but for for most people living in the culture in which we live there's so much there's so much evidence seemingly against it\nIs but you know what amazes me amazes me is I see people walking around oblivious even to the question in curious and just automatically assume that that it is it true uh and I find myself looking back wondering why I wasn't more urgent about it because it is so\nUh so Syria I think because ignoring it uh is easier when we come back folks I Will continue my conversation with the brother of Ross\nAre USS Limbaugh not to be confused with rush or or maybe it's Russia I get confused David Limbaugh is in the in the studio along with his daughter this is so great the book is Jesus is risen stick around\nAnd\nNews or not\nThat much\nI'm so fearful I feel like my world is about to come crashing down around the ...

like the gas in the tank cars go anywhere without gas on the tank and I just want to say to people you know who find themselves in a position like you\nTo say honestly the idea that this is scary and some white is a total lie\nIn and picking up on that I I think there's a there's a lot of paradoxes in Christianity in my view and I talked about some of them in one of the books but I think some some of this pre Christian\nHad this fear that Christians don't have fun they don't enjoy life there like I said they're ... they're they're regimented the robotic they don't they don't live a robust life\nAnd if they do is just to be goody goody isn't the kind of people you wouldn't wanna hang around with 'cause you ... enjoy just because they're they're not happy people some of the kind that I'm not so there are a bunch of well\nI I Know I can give you named after the show okay [laughter] but\nBut what I didn't understand until later and I began to study it I said how can you reconcile this idea that Christianity gives you a liberty Paul talks about um ... it it'll set you free ... believe in Christ in such what okay here's here's the answer that paradox\nBefore you become a Christian you are a slave to send it is your master now I don't mean that kind of sin you're a terrible person all we're all the prey but I'm not in just vernacular labor macular I'm not saying if you're a terrible person maybe in a very nice for it\nBut you're a slave to that kind of lifestyle in his ... it has dominion over over you when you accept Christ as your personal savior\nYou are a liberated from sin and you become a slave to Christ now what does that mean that that that doesn't mean you're free ... and Paul addresses these cars that me and I'm Free to them\nNo in fat ugly now it means you're now a slave to Christ slave I don't want to be a slight know what you understand that you been out of love and the ... you want to even raised yourself to a higher standard of morality\nOr out of obedience and love for Christ and and what it all means but you're not down to you're not living under arbitrary not armed for not living under the the set of rules they transcend that Christ goodness and love\nA transcends all that and you want to be a beating and you're no longer a slight descent\nAnd I want to follow up with this when we come back folks were talking to David Limbaugh

that I'm all in totally agree those skills and so those are two I'll mention right now I'm okay so so anyway we'll getting getting back to the to the book here\nYou are you talk specifically about Paul and the early church what what drove you to write this\nOkay the last book I wrote ... last Christian themed book I wrote was about the gospels and I consolidated them into one heritage chronological narrative and had an ongoing commentary through those\nUh and it was the paraphrasing sometimes verbatim account of every person the gospels\nAnd I I my goal was ultimately the familiarized people with the gospels it hadn't been heretofore\nAnd to help them understand what it means because when I started this then this is true this book to I don't want to promote the other book I'm promoting this book shamelessly but the same thing applies to both and that is when I finally realized that I was holding in my hand the word of God\nOr I Want to ask you to help alliance

going through the scripture what you've done in your book is that this is the new one Jesus has risen Paul in the early church\nYou are effectively ... the scripture another's you're doing a Bible commentary even though you you you're presenting it as a popular book because it is a popular book but the point is that you're also doing a Bible\nCommentary you're helping people because and by the way that is biblical people would say well that's the word of God there's nothing about the word I got well by the way in the word of God says uh unless somebody explains it to you how you can understand that you need somebody who gets it to help you understand what it says that if you just open up the bottom of start reading a lot of people are going to get stuck I\nGot stuck you need somebody to help you and that's what your books are doing\nExactly thanks for saying I I saw a guy and Twitter somebody promoted my book on Twitter and some Senate comes on there no thanks I I got the Bible that's all I\nKnow that's not all you need but we have Sunday school teachers by the way\nBut can you can you imagine if we just got to say like\nThe level of of foolishness that is on social media there are people that advertise their idiocy there the whole world to see and it's this religious spirit when they say I got the Bible like wait a second are you telling me that\nYou shouldn't read anything but the Bible exactly but there are people will say that thing and that's what in the Bible in\nOkay Paul is in in in Athens okay preaching to the Athenians what does he do he quotes pagan poets in the scripture absolutely okay so there's this idea you can't even escape\nPagan poets when you read the word of God so folks that that's going to challenge some people the logically but I'm not challenge and use the Bible is challenging you\nBy the way he he he cited pagan poets not only to show that he was learned but to relate because he he said I become all thinks all people don't sweat the small things I'm going to uh relate to people whoever I have an july's because I can get into their\nAh ended their framework and they'll listen to me if I Know something about their world you don't compromise you don't delete the gospel that's not what he did but he says I'm not going to sweat the small stuff I'll allow us to these certain things he said you you guys believe in God\nBut what about the let me tell you about the living God and so he explained to so get talked to people in their own terms that as a evangelists an apologist so uh but I Would I think you've hit on something else\nI have a lay platform I I'm not the ... and I'm not a pastor but I've studied a lot in my life the Bible and and theology when my adult life\nAnd I feel like I was calling to share what I've learned with people who are similarly situated ... people are not quite there as Christians and Jews and Christians who uh who who want to learn more about the Bible who who are hungry to learn\nBecause I think I can relate to these people in a way that pastors and theologians can't they talk to people on their level and and other levels but they don't most of them don't know what it's like to be a skeptic bless their hearts\nI always wanted but that's exactly right and that's why I write a lot of what I write because I remember vividly what it's like to think Christians are not somebody I Want to be I remember vividly what it's like\nTo think they think they've got all the answers they're idiots I remember that to viscerally yeah and so I feel a passion to reach people who think that way right now but as I say I know what's going through your head I was one of you and I think that it's important for folks like us\nTo write books like this so I I Want to say thank you for writing Jesus has risen people need it\nBut I also want to thank you and I want to shake people out of their complacency even Christians who don't sometimes I just wonder why people aren't more passionate like you and I are about a lot of things ... bumps on a log\nLook this is the word of God it's the living God but God that Senate sun to come down to become a human being and suffer all those indignities for us because it was the only way we could be safe and you don't want to learn more about the Bible I see it now I'm not saying I'm good every day I'm I'm very sporadic\nBut it is so profound that it's really the word of God you got to get into\nSays okay we're going to be right back folks talking to David Limbaugh trust me it's not the coffee is the Holy Spirit you'll see

show\nUnbelievable these kids today with their music you know that the re kind of singers did you know that are the ... that's ... well somebody else does it to like the original but but\nI listened to the right kind of singers version I thought oh that's the version that the movie version I Want to play my program talking to David Limbaugh and David I'm your book is called Jesus is risen and we were just talking about\nHow excited you got in because I find that very interesting when you said that you just when you really discovered that the Bible is the word of God now a lotta times America's we say the word of God and I think we lose a lot of people because the heck does that mean\nWord capital W word the Greek word is logos\nSo when we say the word of God I often think the Protestants evangelicals kind of get it wrong 'cause we're so focused on word as word that we're missing that there's a bigger piece to it the logos to say the word of God\nIs more than the words of God it's a one wonderful thing to say these are this is this is God's word and these are the words of God but to understand that it's a fused with the divinity of God himself it's a fused with\nWith the presence of God and apart from that it's not the word of God right just a bunch of black marks on a page and a minor bird or a parrot could speak the word have gotten it ceases to be the word of God right\nThis is the greatest country in the history of the world not because I say so not because I'm great now because your great but because\nThe ideas behind this country or a gift from God to the whole world we are stewards of these ideas of self government and freedom and basically uh we have to take that seriously it's like somebody gives you an extremely valuable object worth a\n... so much money is so fragile you you can't say that it's not mine I don't care that they've given it to you even trusted with it you need to take it seriously and I think that\nWe have to take what we have seriously and and part of that means we have to understand how it works and so what's been going on with the Kavanaugh nomination\nA has been depressing because people I'm On the Democratic side of the aisle traditionally have played by certain rules and I think somehow they feel now\nThey no longer can play by those rules because there's so much at stake\nI'm that's bad for everybody it's bad for them it's bad for the whole country so I'm asking you if you're listening to this right now [noise]\nPray for this country and we always say that pray for the ...\nI mean genuinely pray when there's a commercial or when you have a second say a prayer whether you're in a car wherever you are say a silent prayer or spoken allowed prayer for this nation for this confirmation process because this is dark stuff right now we are we're talking about\nWhat a man did or didn't do when he was Seventeen years old whether he got drunk or whatever I think wow this is\nThis is madness has descended on America and then when the G O P ... relent to pressure and says okay we'll drag this out again will have the ... of an FBI probe\nOf course Feinstein and others say oh it's not the right kind of FBI proven that deep enough it's not broad enough which really means that they want to delay this forever and they're using every political advantage you have to see it for what it is folks you've got to see it for what it is\nBut it's it's as nasty and unpleasant as anything I have ever seen a man so I Want to ask people pray a pray for Kavanaugh but more than that pray for the country please pray for this country that we can heal and that people who are naked lead part isn't\nA would would understand that we have certain standards that we have to abide by no matter what that's my ... I wouldn't want to say that\nMy fear is if Kavanaugh does not get a a put on the Supreme Court and the Democrats take over in November that that is the one two punch that will knock\nThere is this is why thank you for reminding me to say to everybody you need to vote and actually I Want to say particularly to pastors out there\nYou need to understand you have free speech and the idea that you can't speak politically from the pulpit is a joke and it's being used to keep you silent now you may out of respect for your congregation and I would advise that don't advocate for any candidate for any party but speak about\nHow we have an obligation to vote biblical principles unborn are are expecting us to vote because nobody's protecting them\nA we have all kinds of sexuality issues madness has descended across America and if you don't stand up not just by praying\nBut also by voting I have to say you're going to be held accountable okay you're going to be guilty when bad stuff happens you can send me I should have loaded you know twenty Eighteen it was it was kind of tough for me that day folks please get an absentee ballot now do what you need to do to vote I Want to say I'm speaking of which of people know this week we're doing um\nA fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom when we talk about the madness that has descended on America right now and most Americans get this you don't have to be a conservative or a Christian to get this anybody with common sense a\nGets that uh madness has decided on America okay for example yesterday literally yesterday was today Thursday okay Wednesday yesterday the U.S department of education announced that acting\nOn a complaints filed by our friends at the alliance defending freedom or against the Decatur, Georgia city schools that day the department of education\nIs opening an investigation into a horrible assault of a candor Gardner a girl\nIn her school bathroom as a result of aid boy being allowed into the girls restroom people said this would happen here it is due to the school district transgender bathroom policy okay folk so so here it is it happened immediately almost right\nA pastor Thomas I'm at her daughter was assaulted or this is imagine this is a kindergarten a girl in kindergarten okay here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCake or basically find cause to investigate are now going after him again now this government commission that set up which are completely biased to set up in the first break in fact what's interesting about these commissions one of the requirements as and and\nDo just think if this would ever be allowed for a jury right\nThat the majority of the commissioners have to be someone who is either in would be discriminated against or is part of a group of people that that would have been discriminate wait a minute wait a minute you're kidding me that's that's built into who can be a commissioner so right there it's it's so sad that they set that up that's right\nAnd and so that's how it set up so of course they're coming after people like Jack or minding their own business people like the cheap poor minding their own business and it's it's not activists were out there and people's faces these are people living their lives according to their faith and they're actually finding them seeking them out and going after them in jurisdiction\nOkay so this is why I say if if we're real Americans do not stand up against this violence is if and this is my listeners folks this is you right now right if you don't stand up now and do something\nOr if you don't if you don't understand that this is happening you're you're going to be part of the problem you cannot stay silent because the people have soda so to speak come at a closet on the other side there are no longer pretending to be nice nice they're not playing Patty cake no pun intended they are out\nFor scallops they want to take down anybody who dares defy what they say and we're talking about nice people like the chief who's sitting right here nice people like Jack Phelps in other words the real big it's\nThey don't want anything to do with the real because they want to come after nice people who are definitely not big us and they want to say we're going to make an example of you you're going down we have the courts on our side we have the media on our side and it's why I said in my small platform on this radio program I Want people to know\nIf you allow this to go on you cannot complain when they're going to they will come after you or somebody because this is how nasty it as if you say the wrong thing they're coming after you and so alliance defending freedom you guys are are practically the only game in town I mean you have been doing this for years fighting this battle\nAnd it amazes me that you have pro bono lawyers how many lawyers do you have across the country that are working for you guys\nSo we have about sixty five lawyers internally for ATF but then we have a over three thousand lawyers were allied attorneys are also committing pro bono our okay for the working\nFor free that's ripe for free so I I say to my listeners a ... if you can give something to alliance defending freedom there's a banner on my website but this is just insane we need to know what's going on I hate to talk about it except we must talk about

institutions\n... who else then then the fed says a lot\nSo let me look let us learn a little about you where you were you always on the conservative side\nI was always a conservative and I can I can track it back to an incident incredibly Seventy one or Seventy two when I was five or six years old and you remember the Vietnam War was on the three channels every single night remember\nGirl door remember yeah\nAnd I remember and I'm a little kid and there was some now but uh that the uh United States was going to stop arming medivac helicopters there have put a big red cross on it take the guns off and hope that the con didn't shoot at six years old and\nI hear this on TV I kinda tournament yeah anger I don't know that doesn't seem right\nTo me that's the moment I realized the laugh\nAnd our our cultural league wins in an entirely different world than reality that reality is constructed purely on their own desires what they want to be true that our enemy wasn't a bunch of Savage is what they created it like it was true\nAnd it was normal Americans who have to pay the price when they got shot at a country that is that is the earliest moment I knew I was\nA very very interesting that you had the federally okay that certainly answers my question\nYour thesis or a with regard to regular Americans and the title militant normal\nOr just for a moment ... ... my column this week at your town hall\nWas about the hatred of middle class values on the west which they acknowledge that this is not even that African it's not so your ... they would acknowledge they don't like the normal they're better than they can then\nFine yeah ... ... we have in every society has an elite these are the people who are charged with managing the institutions of any society I ain't your Romans had Nutley according suddenly everybody knows everybody has a ... that's how society works and they take a little off the top ten is you know they take a little money power and prestige\nFor doing this job but in return to normal people just want to go through their wives and want to go to church or temple they want to coach crickets basketball team maybe they want to drink a beer\nI think that they don't they don't want to be involved in the right they want prosperity and they want security and when they don't get it they start getting angry and and we saw that in the silent majority and that revolt against uh the uh the very liberal or a governor and usually the elite has the wisdom\nTo to look at itself over itself accountable and and trying to change course a little and the normal kind of go back to sleep now what's different especially since the sixties and the rise of the radical left\nThe elite hate its own people and you can find us ... and it's not just\nThere is there a historical precedent for that I I don't know of any I'm I'm not saying that there isn't there okay\nI've worked for one right and you know ... now and I want to distinguish it from you know a Roman a number of uh the elite might look down on a you know the bread and circus a crowd and go well there are a little vulgar but they acknowledge that were in those older people\nDecided the basic heart and soul the the the values and the tradition\nAnd what made Romans Rome or what may woman's role wasn't that senators it was the guys on the Roman straight and the same thing is true with America these normal for the people who built this country Dennis they feed it you'll it they fight for it\nAnd what's happening now is on parts and I think it's happening in other countries to is the lead has decided that the people they are are are presuming to lead are unworthy of the\nProblem is listening I I I guess that it that is right I think I I I think the title of your book is so good I I think it should come into the standard lexicon of language today in America militant normal that it's not\nAngry white guy [laughter] I Know what the white guy exactly it's the guy who sits right\nYou know there are are are normal and normal\nKnowing a lot of ... and a lot of whites are not the lead is overwhelmingly white\nWhat that is that is true and remember the at least not at ... ... we only need to clarify that are betters aren't any better than we are this meritocracy as to demonstrate any merit over the last few decades look at the the L look at a bumbling of the Iraq War look at the two thousand\nA of a finance of Wall Street and of course the normal as always got handed the check in the league is a leap because and embrace value norms customs and we're taboos\nOf the ... whether it's global warming or sixty eight gender\nYou can delete if you went to Harvard and work on Wall street or if you're a Democrat Senator or if you're some guy ended up
