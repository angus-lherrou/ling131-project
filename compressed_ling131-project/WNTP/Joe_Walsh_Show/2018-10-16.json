concerned or because they just figured\nThat uh\nLike blacks they could get eighty to Ninety percent of Latinos to vote Democrat\nUm\nYou know Trump is\nIs such a racist they say and he's so bigoted and he's so bad on immigration and he's deporting illegals and the Democrats just figure that all of these\nOf Trump\nOr would lead to certainly more enthusiasm among Latinos but also a higher percentage of Latino voting for Trump\n\nBut you know what's really interesting and Democrats you don't get this and so many people in in the country forget about this\n[noise] you know when you when you poll the American people on a new illegals on people coming into this country illegally\nDo you know that most Latinos who are in this country legally legally ah most of them oppose people coming here illegally\nSee Democrats have always figured that like my language and uh uh uh Trump's language and people who speak a pretty steadfastly about keeping people out of this country illegally that that's going to hurt Republicans with Latino voters\nBut no in fact Latino knows who are here legally oppose illegal immigration even more than a white Americans oppose illegal immigration and you never ever ever hear\nThe media to talk about that\nDrives me batty you never hear of the media to talk about that\nThe media loves to downplay that fact suicide at all a surprise to me that\nTrump's

you are Democrats are really missing that one\nAnd the media is purposely missing that one\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred the Democrats have a Latino problem\nI I think\nThe reason

Wall Street journal a liberal report or has been reporting on that there were certainly not alone\nUm but the you said the evangelical group so called they're not actually\nI'm a very dangerous and can intentionally confusing if they'd like scrape the way he painted and in fact Eric right now there are ministers on buses all across America\nCalled ... the common good that they're they reclaiming geez that meant a and that is essentially trying to reclaim power a by breaking up the the natural tendency at the Christians to vote for a platform of of life and fried out as\nWell as the giant so cynical but as young people are so impressionable and they have good hearts and I mean I noticed this happened\nWith my book on William Wilbur force write I write about will before ... slave trade or in in my book amazing gray up and I got a phone call from governor John Case it right and he was all excited about it and I was so honored that this governor is reading about Wilbur force\nBut what I realize is that he and others they kind of took it in the wrong direction and lose it all became about social justice let me tell you something William Wilbur force was not about social justice the way we see it today and sometimes people who have good hearts\nAnd they they are Christians and they kind of get sucked in this direction and the reason I wanted to have you on us to tell them be\nNot to be on a President Trump ... it's the future of the country that we're talking about and so the reeds and sorrows and others Obama even with funding through the state department or some faith groups\nTo do mass migration was that it was quickly connected to a ... ... voter registration\nRight and so this is about power and period\nAnd a sadly open society foundation is it twenty five billion dollar foundation funding all this a lot of the stuff around the world America is one of dozens of countries that he's undermining and demoralizing to we need to wake up with these that said the ... and it's a new stuff\nAnd we need to vote and we need to bring our white friends with us\nIt's it's really amazing I you know I speak all around the country and I and I often say that if you were ever tempted not to vote or to say politics is not for me that crocheting politics don't mix that is bad\nTheology has bad it's not biblical if the Bible said that\nI'd be screaming about it on this program because it's important to do with the Bible says but the Bible doesn't say that people since the beginning of time at miss understood scripture so it's really important that you take the responsibility to understand what it says and does and doesn't say and I really think that a lot of sweet young people have been swayed and pulled\nLeft toward you know past tax social justice because they missed understand what it says of course we're supposed to be compassionate but the question is how and I\nI have to say with Kanye West uh you know appearing to praise this president for his policies a lot of young people are thinking\nYou know what maybe we have been getting it wrong maybe Donald Trump's policies are compassionate\nMay be the policies of the people who talk about compassion are not compassionate and I really think we have to think for ourselves you can't just when somebody says that we believe in compassion we believe in helping the poor doesn't mean they're doing it and this is the thing is that if you want to destroy your future and if you don't want to help the poor and then you'd float along with the socialist\nTied but the fact that evangelicals are being very cynically drawn into this uh ... it's just so good to have you wind up to wake people up to understand that a huge effort has been made it's been going on since the Obama administration and before two thousand and eight and two thousand twelve\nOr I mean you know that for a fact don't you\nDo and I think it's time for all Americans to look past words like progress that actually regrets and compassion let's not compassion we have\nTo Jesus said you know that for you know the tree by the fruit and so American evangelicals dot com we make tried to make the case that biblical truth is the highest love for human beings and for cultures it's on loving to pay the ... the global at social engineers people suffer\nAnd you know open borders are less loving than wise welcome\nSocialism is less loving than human creativity made in God in God's image hands sexuality is less loving than cabinet marriage\nOut where it with with without covering it marriage we see it break out of poverty and polygamy and disease and loneliness children not protected from abuse and trafficking it with common in marriage that with the progress that what the greater luck a solid\nIt's evil could break up

ahead tell America\nBlame how comedy works for them to go a little deeper where are you not expect me to go\nAnd I know for a fact you're not that deep so let's see what happens while I was kind of\nSort of way comedy works his first there's a set up and then there's a punch on your set up is when a comedian uses talent and resources the fees and the opportunity to ensure that the audience is moving in the same direction\nOr the ... when he changes that direction in a way they're not expecting them to catch on to that change they received the punch line results or evolution fulfillment enjoy express through laughter\nNow be in life it's a very similar versus just set up\nAnd then there's a punch line you're set up as your talents your resources your opportunities affects your marriage or your car at his radio show your set up is about what you've received and everybody knows they're set up with your punch lines about what you call to deliver\nAnd not everybody understands that the punch line is and we don't know your punch line and you know you're set up you make a mistake then you realize something's missing and you'll think what you need is more set up [noise] just get a car if I could just get married if I could just get more and more and more what you really need to know is what is your punch line\nAnd just like me as a child struggle more reading even your setbacks are part of your set up to deliver the punch line you're caught delivers kind of like a slingshot further you've been set back the further you can reach but the question is what are you going in for\nYou have obviously thought this through this is not just something this is not off the cuff there's this should be a Ted Talk is what they should\nSo this is kind of ... so this is the thought process behind the morning funny movie hidden things October Eighteen because at the end of it uh there's a really strong call to action for people to step up and deliver\nWay record your before we go

this book don't because it's really hard to read how ever\nBe a point now how both the likelihood the high likelihood that use actually use the rate up in areas yeah yes no joke lately like I knew I Know but because we know the end of the story people assume that wasn't funny but as you read the Bible not read it I see the pony in there all day long\nI mean it's just right there even just throughout the Bible or when a Abraham decided video circumcised his whole house like what are the conversation ... he was like uh-huh\nThey're like OK I changed my name and you got your circle so they were you change their name I don't know you put them sort of known as you're talking about like Mm I don't understand how that we've had that ... is like yeah but yeah so much money in the Bible

...\nTo rhythm here and I've never who was I've never wanted to sing that song but I got to tell you something uh\nWhat you say is true in fact just the other day I had a sermon ... five when Jesus tells Peter\nThrow your net down in the boats right at the beginning was ministry when he said a moment you fissures of men right there any blows their minds because they throw the nets in and they get so many fish they can't they need help in the boat start to think of ... so he blows their minds but nobody ever noticed this before at least I shouldn't say that but I I went on the Internet and I scoured\nThe I put in Luke five John Twenty one cousin John Twenty one of the same thing happens and it's a totally different thing that happens in the end of his ministry three years later when he appears on the seashore\nAnd he has already been resurrected and he's appearing and stuff like that and at that point in ... and John Twenty one he says to them hey draw your nets on the on the right side of the boat and they're like they will arise and they told them that's down in the same thing happens right ... ... and it's at\nThat moment that they realize like why it is Jesus right and I thought to myself that and I'm not kidding that is like comedy because you can dean going like watch\nDid you picture it absolutely down the shore and he's like watch this and he he does that\nAnd the German accent and it does that happens they realize\nIt Jesus Christ or ... years earlier at the beginning of their whole lives in a million years ago running thing happened in whatever and I thought it's kind of like a wink you know and we always think of him as being very pious and Syria you could just see the joy and burn a little twinkle there too and there's a lot of that scene scripture\nAnd when I grabbed her bow out imagine when they were pulling up the fish the second time it was heavy to build a lot of fish and they have reprised green boat Jesus like who was the right way to do it I suppose\nTo engineer so that was so bad that I'm going to share a bad joke goes dead according to scripture\nUh it's not it's not wise to fly in airplanes because Jesus said low I Am with you\nOK we should be cashed why many laps or ... you know last time she was a lapse I'm okay actually I heard the joke from the top of the times square church a twenty four years ago [noise] okay so that's

forget all the people who are on the field\nFor life but it ... place so maybe my question wasn't clear I Know that there will be individuals who were tipped over right is there a point where Americans\nNon left wing Americans you know will have their tipping point and say oh oh oh the last ... really is dangerous\nOh it's happened I think it's happened and I don't think it's wishful thinking I just look at the social media and in the last three weeks of the capital hearing I I was in Manhattan last week for the for the launch of why we fight and an older couple recognize me as I was waiting to get on the train back to D.C\nAnd they came up to me and they said we just quite people living our lives in in in Trenton New Jersey but we've had enough where we're going to vote we're going to support down ticket Republicans because what they did to the godly man\n... absolutely right just individual was truly filthy and disgusting so yes I think we have reached the tipping point when you have a you know set it has like Feinstein like book or like a Kamala Harris impugn the reputation of a man who\nWho is whiter than the driven snow I think we've already arrived\nFlown they would say yes that's the problem is wider than the\nDriven snow\nThat's how sick it's become that that that's probably a a a a phrase that will be renounced but yes so you think sorry so I Want to get this clear you think that that I Do too\nI think that for a not for all Americans but for a very significant numbers the Kavanaugh hearings worth tipping point to say the left and the Democrats have gone too far so that it that is your position\nIf if you if you're on on the millennial who's sitting in some ivory tower and being brainwashed every day if you're just an average American and you look at the first five minutes of the Kavanaugh hearing\nYou had enough I mean ... that was the righteous indignation power excellence and I think that's the capitalist\nWell that's the hope that I so want to fight to ask you this prior to the Kavanaugh here and do you think that there was a tipping point before or you really do believe that's the key one\nNo I I didn't I didn't see before\nI while I was so this is traumatic to you what happened\nOh my gosh look this is if it's in it's in the last chapter in my book it's wicked chambers and I I didn't know what was going to happen with Kavanaugh but afterwards I said my gosh we need to wake up because this is a new mission shock anybody this isn't just blow this isn't just\nParents taught us they've been doing the left has been doing this since Nineteen food\nRight hey what you're saying is America out there are millions of Whittaker Chambers way right now about waking up\nYeah OK from your mouth to God's Ears anyway from your from his pen to your mind Sebastian Gorka has book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies it ends up in\nVenice prayer done come we continue to Dennis Craig or show\nRight the list this president I'll tell you another thing that the Capitol hearing revealed to be although I wasn't surprised this was not a revelation but\nThe confirmation I should say more than anything else and this will really shocked a lot of people who loads of man I think he has a good heart\nDonald Trump yes\nI can attest to this is what Dr phil left insane and they will never believe it or whether it's inviting the survivors the victims of the Parkland shooting to the west wing to talk to them or whether it's holding the hand of that that an African American grandmother whose son had been killed\nThis is who he is and and the shocking thing that I can tell you because I worked for him and I you know I write down the influences and and why we fight us the evidence of this she she is compassionate\nTo you as an American whether you voted for him or not she knows okay he doesn't see skin color you don't see party affiliation if you're an American you deserve to be safe and you deserve to prosper on fat or friend who never going to try to live by the hardcore left\nFinally a in why we fight your book and again it is up with Dennis ... dot com my friends and you ... if it's Sebastian Gorka eroded it's pretty self recommending [laughter] but I I have been saying for years\nAnd I think I was one of the first and I'm not saying this to brag I'm ... I'm seeing it because it's now become common place for more so in any event that we are in a civil war how do you react to that\n[noise] coming from people who lived through war my parents as children lived a undid mobs occupation then my father was tortured imprisoned by the communists [noise]\nI I find it difficult to use that phrase and I also remember that the ... the great this death toll in any war America's fooled wasn't in Korea wasn't in Vietnam was in the world will too but all in our civil war six hundred thousand killed so I I have a a kind of it\nUh Bullock again I I respect that so I I was using short hand my listeners Bill White I've almost always add and thank God it's non violent right so if I attached that adjectives\nAnd I and without not okay I was just getting away with don't agree with that because it gives you feel polite I Do I really want to know what you're saying\nNo ... without a doubt when you have ... members\nOf a two party system on one side saying we will get when you have the former attorney general say we will kick you when you walk down when you have Maxine Waters say I want you to harass physically harass thrive email members of the cabinet when you see them pumping gas or the gas station\nThat that I'm here to ya that's telling I I got to take a break Sebastian Gorka his book\nNine Ninety intelligence service of talk\n[noise]\nThat sort\nOf news I've had for ...
