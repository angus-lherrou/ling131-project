I think yeah\nI I actually read a lot about it and that pretty convinced that you know John John McCain and others like Joe Biden navy at some level this up on to their ear\nOn my dash you're freaking me out okay uh well I ah I that's why I hardly ever talk on the that's not why hardly ever talk on the phone but I hardly ever talk on my cell phone I'm not some people kind of live on the cell phone I Can't do that but I'm\nJust as we're talking about this president I and I was saying that he you know I'm agreeing with you in the sense that there's a level of sanity\nThat he displays in other words you you may disagree with him and all kinds of stuff but there is a kind of fundamental soundness to ah to the way he approaches things which you would call sanity and basically\nUm I think it frightens the political left to death I think they're very scared by it I think when Kanye West\nOf you know who really was was a agreeing with that and saying that there's something here his leadership of the I think it really scares people because they're used to having these kind of you know politically correct robots that are that are focus grouping everything in polling everything and they don't they don't know how to think\nAh for themselves Trump really doesn't he's not afraid to because he's done it so successfully for so many decades that it really nothing can stop if [laughter] at least the last minute\nYeah and I think I think that you know your assessment or analysis of it you know the\nCartel or the flop or whatever you want to call it at a some change very well\nUh in its own apparatus to all age decades um public party cannot mockery I mean literally you know get a consultant controlled everything and you see it and get their millions every election whether they win or lose so they don't really care\nAs long as they get hired the next election well but you know they had a bunch of no go ahead sorry\nYou have a bunch of ... kitchen who you know all each other to keep their uh\nYou know will leak blew a\nFunctioning of the way it is their cushy relationship with the media there or Detroit cocktail party and all the rest of the president came along and he didn't care about it\nAnd he's willing to wake up at cartel and he's going to drain the swamp and he was willing to dismantle\nThe apparatus that they spent decades building and there's a lot of money at stake here it uses a cabin on it just the cabinet\nAnd of course I could get you a hundred other apple this president has one nature accomplishment every thirty six hour at you know and that's with no doubt by the way some she any Republican any Democrats or any media and so I'm looking at it like that and you think wow\nIn show business most people I think we need and talk we right they do get television shows like I Do every day a news next to me um I think most people\nWho are out in the public and put themselves out there believe their ideas or we're hearing how your you know this isn't right I think that they're selfish maniac they're going to go kill somebody but I'm saying if you run for public office especially that state level or higher\nCertainly for president at the United states I think you would have a difficult case proving that you weren't and not just that\nSome some level right\nThat's right and I and I put myself in that category as well about it\nBut that doesn't make you in shape and it doesn't make you eat all and it doesn't make you idiots now are all evil people are\nProbably but they're placed on the spectrum of very very different kind of nuts it's it's a lego maniacal kind of not just isn't that a dangerous right and I believe you know kept other mental efficiencies as well but people get really confused about\nPsychology being a science and it's really not Eric it's really an eerie there's nothing you know it's not a scientific is global warming\nAnd I don't think that either and so you're right people have to be neat\nYeah so I think one of them were really important things to do here cleaning it and make with you on this before we go any further and that is they started with the Trump Russia thing to try to destroy him because they don't like his ideas they went to the women thing they tried to destroy I'm with now starting at the end of this paying his legal fees\nWho knew that could happen you know there's going to continue\nThat I Believe their final\nEffort is going to be to try to declare the president mentally incompetent insane or or perhaps with some sort of degenerative mental condition that we have to be ready to fight back for our values and the things that we've accomplished with the ministry alone you that's been working for for decades\nWell you're you're right and I also think that well we haven't mentioned speaking as a creative I think creativity\nUh in madness and I use madness in quotes but there's a relationship there knows if you're thinking out of the box and you think differently than others do people always want to call you crazy or you know burned her she's a witch\nBecause she thinks differently and I think that this president without any question is wildly creative his brain is churning in ways\nThat a lot of people and again doesn't mean you have to agree with him but you have to give him credit that he's thinking outside the box and he's extremely creative he'll do things\nThat you know you you would you could do to take classes on how to be president for a hundred years and they will never tell you to do what he's done with Kim Jong own or others he really is doing some things where\nI can imagine people say like oh I don't know that seems pretty weird to me but the point is that\nHe has a ... about it and he has been successful over the decades and so I think we have to give him the benefit of the doubt but I think you're right that that when people have nothing else this is where they're going to go\nWell and that's the whole reason why I wrote about politics because everything good kind of crazy [laughter] you know crazy like a Fox has it turned out well I'll do that quite a bit and very well there's also the kind of\nPassionate kind of madness you know where he was mad skills I think the president does have mad skills and then there is about kind of crazy that we all hope to avoid in our life to the best of our ability by the grace of God I don't think he gets in that third category and that's why I Will not politics and titled it as such\nWell it's fascinating to me because I as somebody who um you know has observed this president I often describe him as a maniac and when I say that I'm complimenting him I looser uh obviously I just wrote a book\nAbout Martin Luther a year ago lose there was a maniac people couldn't believe the things that came out of his mouth he was also\nA flat out genius I mean it's so so for us to be really you know simplistic about it and say well there's kind of you know you've got people that that uh\nThey know how to make widgets and they're very very simple and they're staying in anybody's creative while they're crazy well you know it's as you say it's objective and and I think that uh you know most Americans won't buy it most Americans understand that even if they disagree with somebody like this that certainly doesn't

I'm an education that we're not at all I have\nHeard that in the work that I Know John ... who is a he was the problem um he\nIs very very warm so pragmatic so learning that did that was intended to children from the employment to their parents had embarked them on the independent investigation where there is no object to it\nI Know now so let me let me a hit pause here to say that there are a lot of people listening or who aren't really familiar with John do we I don't know much about do we accept to know that he's guilty of what you just said that he's one of the seminal bad guys\nThis story and so when did he lives and and why were his ideas adopt and now we've all heard of the Dewey decimal system in the libraries are so he's made that minor\nOr anti dine contribution but the point is that he was a large figure and when did you live and when with these ideas accepted\nSure absolutely he I'm doing it was a a there was a professor of education even though a lot for my background is a lot they write so I'm always interested in me and tell us optical angle here and talking this is Theresa\nHistory yet their daily lives around the I'm In the Nineteen very active in the Nineteen twenties up to the Nineteen forties\nUm and he was a philosopher but he also taught in education and if you look at the um philosophy of education that permeates our public school he

pragmatism we all have some sense of what it means to be pragmatic to be practical but you're talking about pragmatism as a philosophy\nAs a philosophy which which really and it is that there's no

responsibility for my own children of us who are listening who don't have children or who are in position to help Marshall three sources and try to come\nCome together I think of creative solutions it's also it's on every one if you are involved in a church you need to look around and try to find a way to educate your young people\nWell I mean you can amateur this is the whole thing is that I Know so many people in these people to me that they are heroes\nThey are home schooling their kids it blows my mind that they can do this but then you find people that are home schooling their kids and they don't seem to be as amazing anything how're you doing it and then they tell you well um we have ... different ways to do it there are other families are in the neighborhood or in the town to do this\nAnd we so the idea that you yourself\nHave to home school your kids there's a whole network or with all kinds of resources so that's that's a very real option I think a lot of people aren't aware of that\nRight and that's one thing I mean I Would emphasize here at home schooling today is radically different from what it was before because of the Internet because of the availability of\nOf collapsed because it's it's just much easier to accomplish it and it's no longer kind of the ... thing that it was maybe Thirty years ago or something [laughter]\nSo it's I Know parents who are working full time who are home schooling but they do that collaboratively with others but I guess the real point out what may care Eric is that there is a cost to education right no matter what you do now it might be a financial cost if you choose a private school might be at time cost if you're home schooling\nBut they're the cost to the public education system when we're looking at these

it's too late the authors Theresa for an end and Mary writes Hassan on the line this is so dramatic you were talking about the cost\nAnd and the cost is you know if you ask somebody hey\nIs the salvation of your child or is the uh development of your child or into someone whom you would be proud of a and excited about watching a as an adult\nIt is what does that were to you that's the that's the question and I and I think when people say well the public school is cheaper you really have to wonder\nIs there a way to afford to send your kid to a private school that seriously religious or a home school because what you're describing and I know this is true we don't have the time to go into all the horrific details but it is monstrous with public education in America has become\nLike a chore yeah you know the thing is Eric you only um you only get to do child who want with your with each ... each one of your children you don't get it do over and so I'm One of the first thing we have today that the parent and educate yourself I mean we\nHave my kids are in a parochial school system and there's there's an end to late available\nThey the school want to have been very good about working with students and families in terms of helping people to come up with creative ways to afford education for the first step for any parent to educate yourself they keep in mind you're right these costs\nAre huge and we call it in our book tester fan who is a um you know professor of education and one of his comments that now as Americans we tend to think our own public school is doing a great job and then and yet we know cognitively that public education on a hall hidden even getting that well academically\nHair pointer was during his point was that even in the suburban schools if you look at our school for ... for national were falling behind so in educating\nYourself take a realistic look at the education your child's getting an addition to them on the formation that they're getting like high deformation because we're supposed to morally former children that they are morally being formed against our beliefs against our faith so in addition to that they're not even\nGetting the spectacular education networking promise then that the schools are sure that they're getting and we know that I had\nAn Eric I Would add to that that people sometimes\nWill say well I Know the teacher or I Know the principal you know I Know these people I can trust them and what they have to realize is that teachers and administrators are wearing a straight check they may be a person of faith\nThey're not allowed to show that right so I don't know if you heard the news about I think it was Alabama there are there now going to have to us motto in God we trust in some of the school district right and the problem is you can have that model and that's a good thing\nBut if a child turns to a teacher and says who's God or why do I trust him a teacher cannot answer yeah and and they will be sued and and and this is one of the driving forces or why it's not possible to sort of wait it out and hope that the schools are going to recover\nThat money or at least a portion of it even given how much states are spending per child sometimes ten Fifteen thousand dollars per child even if you gave parents half of that and allow them to use it\nTo you is tutors supplemental services to afford to private schools to home school whatever it might be parents are going to make a far better decision and they'll get the education they want but but we have a lot of um [noise]\nI say this but kind of cowardly legislators who are cowed by the education unions and buy all the advocacy unions who say you can't disrupt the public schools and my question to them is\nIs are the public school is doing what we want them to do they're they're turning out kids who are politically left who have no faith\nWho are gender confused where activists in in the you know sort of left wing sense is that really where most legislators if you put it like that is that really where they think the tax parents want their money to go we need to create alternative\nWell it it really is a it is shocking that legislators I mean I tend not to think of politicians as being courageous people um but in this case it\nIs up to the people which is to say the voters to make them understand you must do this we demand that you do this or this is why we elected you\nRight in there a lot of um uh how how they put it ... home care when it comes to the dialogue surrounding this you can't ... so that people complaining that you're trying to defund the public schools\nBut actually if you look at um the proposals that are out there they always preserve the operating costs for the school and then they they take the money that the instructional cost per student\nIn the end to the public schools are not they find that they really don't lose they don't have the same amount of money they will need to ... those children\nRight any amount of money to get into the parents certainly not a huge chunk that is normally allocated per student because every single proposal reserve the operating costs and so that that's one of one of the problem here is that\nThat the teachers union has gotten out ahead of the game in terms of ... radical proposal to defund the public schools and then presented as a matter of\nInjustice to children in poor neighborhoods and and the reality of it is Eric that the parents in poor neighborhoods I mean you look at\nParents in the city of Philadelphia they overwhelmingly support vouchers their kids are trapped in school and they don't like\nAnd let's face it the department of education a and the American public schools are part of what I now think of as the swamp they are no longer doing anything except serving their own interests\nThey don't care about the kids they always pretend to but unfortunately they don't demonstrably they don't and by the way\nNot even a for them to decide whether they care it's up to the parents to decide whether they're doing what the parents want them to do and the idea that we pushed away from this\nAh really horrifying as I said it's fundamentally un American it's certainly goes against face a which is what makes it an American American America we're supposed to have the freedom or to educate our kids as we see fit\nAnd public schools are saying no you don't and you think where did they get the right to do that\nI don't know what happened but we need to undo it quickly\nRight and one of the things parents to relate to in this and they can why it's not possible to change the situation before it's too late for your child is it not only do you have the ads that advocacy organizations from the outside pressuring in the end you have all the professional education associations\nNational school boards association National Association of school counters elementary schools\nAll of these are have adopted the progressive mindset\nAnd they're pushing an agenda and so all of that weighs heavily on school boards and on\nAnd even the local um educators when they're trying to figure out which direction they're going to go in so it's it's really not possible for a good teacher to to push back against the\nThe Saddam me of pressure that's coming their way\nAnd and it's just a it's a much more difficult situation than parents might realize I that's why we encourage them to really\nYou know we did what we've collected in this book and and just confront\nThe reality and then ... true
