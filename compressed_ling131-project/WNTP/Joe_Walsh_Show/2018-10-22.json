fifty to fifty four\nAnd before we go back to all of your phone calls and we've had some great ones so far the show I expect even better was to come so called now is that we have some interesting item that crossed my basket my screen that you just need to know about\nBut like for example this past week there was a huge taxpayer in Japan now ten years ago if I were to say ... fair in Japan you'd say okay it's all about TV the DVR than home entertainment systems well that's not the case anymore\nBut hot now are these tiny little sensors that accurately measure\nWhat's your body is doing and how your body is reacting\nLike for example Panasonic was showing off an armchair that measures how much your hands are sweating along with how you're sitting in facial expressions are being tracked by a camera ... why all of this be used in deemed tracked and analyze so that this way you know how stressed out you are\nAnother company we're at a manufacturing has a small device that you hold for a minute between your thumb and your ... and it measures pulse rate and the nervous system\nThen there's this device that was created by a line for hygiene they say if you're worried about your teeth you can smile and a smartphone app and then the company will tell you about your oral hygiene okay there that Center for the tab that measures water temperature your poll and body temperature\nAnother sense in her crib and upload data to a computer showing whether the baby rose onto stomach temperatures bags so this way\nAn adult can get a text message if necessary [noise] these sensors are just for humans by the way sharp you know the economy they developed a kitty litter tray with monitor to it measures the cabs urine volume in frequency\nWhy because some reason we need to know that I guess\nAnd they also had a ton of robots gay parents I Know you can relate to this how many times have you told the kids to clean up their room only for you to walk around the corner in a hallway and the family room in the bedroom and you step on a lego oh my gosh\nLeg goes hurt when you step on them here's a little fun fact for you a single lego brick and support nine hundred and fifty three pounds of pressure before compressed does that mean when you step on a lego the lack of give is what makes it hurt so often\nAnd so hard or at a start up with money from Tokyo showed off I robot they can pick up toys I can pick up close up the floor and put them in their proper places yeah\nThey're going to sell these robots I could clean up the dirty played for the dishwasher\nThese objects through building cameras overtime at wanders around the house takes an inventory of all the household possessions\nOr they say maybe all these robots could help keep the kids entertain so they wouldn't be on the X. box or the eye pad anymore and I know what you're thinking sure I mean I could totally arid without scream time I could also turned my own butter but let's not get crazier\n[noise] All right if you or someone you know as a reader there's a new Kindle paper white that's out of the big deals as you can now take your Kindle and you can read when you're taking a

you know I was reading on my Kindle they said you know Kim\nHow many books can you actually fit on a candle and I said to you know you can fit about a thousand bucks on a candle but after a hundred it starts getting heavy\nAnd um my relative to actually image because oh I can see how that would happen and it was like okay [noise]\nAll right if you got kids in the family he or she certainly doesn't maybe need a smart watch but maybe you want to get them one because rise and has a new what's called the gizmo watch as part of a bunch that offers for geo ... basically a virtual leaf\nAnd it has the gizmo hub impair within Iowa has Android device you can track the location of the kids at all times or you can also safety zones and you get alerts of kid happens to step outside a designated area\nYou can also pick up to ten contacts to being called the kid on unapproved numbers won't even go through by the way twenty pre approved text messages that can be spent you could shut off to

were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we're in our last month and a half\nYear and so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been arguing\nAll the great things I mean every day's an adventure and what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have a or read you don't know we have\nA full size a refrigerator Airbus and if your guest decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nI have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there\nSo we didn't get systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there trying to do in the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we're going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard or was that we have to take out the side when does it take off\nAnd have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window I'm short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it ... it\nWas it was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] I [laughter] All right so Andrew

stores where\nEverything digital like I like to say because after all I'm Tim commando America the letter digital got us here with you once again and the phone lines are open\nI'm sure you have at least a few questions about dumping digital I can lend a hand to and that number is one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us\nOnce again that number's one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four and before we get back to all of your phone calls that show some more interesting item that crossed my desk and screen that you just need to know about first to wedge it's one of these ideas that popped up and I'm telling ya I should have thought of that this is a product\nThat if I ever wanted to create a product it satisfy the name it's private it's secure I think it's too pricey right now but let me tell you a little bit about it [noise] the idea of a whole personal email server it kinda got a bad rap with Hillary Clinton and her emails and that whole fiasco\nBut the whole idea is that your email is safe it's not handled in a cloud you actually have a physical drive now setting up an email server used to mean calling in the nerds calling them again when you need to change up some settings and calling them again when it just died because it would happen\nBut there's a new product called hell\nAnd your emails no longer floating in the cloud somewhere and said actually physically in your home the server like I mentioned it expensive five hundred bucks by the size of a book\nAnd it has a hundred and twenty a gigs and storage or trade and go to five terabytes there is no fan passively clued cold rather\nUm it has a security Kiev physical key because all the emails encrypted so it's not just five hundred bucks and there's a hundred dollar a year subscription faith and\nIf you think about it this way there's other downsides and one of them primarily is that you're not going to have all the latest features tangy male and auto complete and tab auto it's going to fill out all the sensors for you but it's a product that does have an edge it does have a need\nAnd when the price come down and I think it's probably worth taking a look at\nAnd other new products we're talking about smart home technology yeah was specifically ever you ever thought about how your couch it into your home\nYour wish that your couch you can go up

set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah I have a a website that I have one son mind right now what I'm trying to put together but another part of my practice and I'd been toying with the idea of putting a check a function I'm not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you or you know is it are easy to do and of course what kind of backup do I need to have the cars and employment of people to support that to the questions or what have you\nAlways all they're all really good questions by the way Tom I'm\nYou know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\n[noise] well I Would say I have to have some of them play so I just recently was approached by a company that said that they would do is they would have a\nA a employ individuals to support the ah the chat function and how that would work as they would give me dirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask and then those are the three questions I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call in they would get a hold of this company and they have to ask the question though she they had the the canned answer that I've already given but of course are those who didn't 'cause she goes ... of those dirty question yeah\nAnd I got and here's the reason why I'm hesitating that\nIs that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robot that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extended that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my role hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get and you you are able to\nTurn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that he will engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your side from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um\nAre you building the side or somebody building for you\nAh yes well the the we do have a a website it's already been billed than we have another company building a another website I'll always remember that when we have a third tempting is calling me about that in this chat function\nI don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters the kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also listen to those questions under FA choose as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening and chats in box and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank
