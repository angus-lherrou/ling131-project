talk to somebody about how the how how do they get through the Mexican border the Mexicans just don't care\nI keep remain conflicting reports of it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred and forty years at seven thousand\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question is how they just have such a large group get through Mexico about that I think Mexico cares\nA ... it was all substantial part of their population lives in the United states in ... Mexico they send back billions of dollars and\nWe take the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially were a note silly every government of Mexico me and my state and the left thinks that that is a terrific thing even though all of those is in ... the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are unhappy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in significance compared to the possibility of more Democrats\n'cause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections so that's what they do the import Democrats that an amazing thing was that done anywhere else in the world and the democracy\nWe import millions of people in order to have you with elected that's what it's about\n[noise]\nAnd it's a it's a big question we should have some folks are because the big question here how are they going to be stopped see this is me and my fear is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people but not going to come to the border and they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back to ... miles or Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what the distances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSo yeah it's a fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to acknowledge that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSee they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just the prefer California\n'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches was there was not landlocked to the best of my college so I don't ah\n[laughter] you have to live in this make believe world that are on the left is created there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral way to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to flee best numbers wonderfully they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful or equally wonderful or non wonderful culture get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin America ...
