hundred something which is decent right but it's still not in the top one hundred\nWell this morning are just now it jumped to one Seventy so we're we're breathing down the neck of the top one hundred right what's the number one book in the country Steven cold there has written a bitter anti Trump\nFake children's book now it's a real thick children's book in the sense that you would never give it to a kid it looks like a kids' book but it's not appropriate for children because it's just kind of mean and weird\nBut my book of course is uh even though it's a huge book for adults like old bears book it's really also a children's book genuinely you can give it a kids and people are giving his kids and kids like it and they specially like to say George Soros\nBut what drives me crazy is that called Barry is on every night right being mean it's one thing not to like a president but he's pretty vicious if I had a TV show like his\nI Would never be that vicious about Hillary Obama or whatever it's one thing to correct jokes I mean Johnny Carson always cracked jokes about the president but there's a meanness to it that bothers me and so of course now he's ... he and his writers and put out this book and it's literally number one\nIn the country and so\nI kind of like to send a message or to the to the country and this and to Mr cold there are by having my book uh at some point over take his book yes so that\nIn his book will have to drop from number one and a or my book could just go to number one but you know there's so many people in this country who don't hate the president and I kind of think like hey I'm if you don't eat the president\nOr maybe this book is for you and I actually think that this is a good book to give to people who don't like the president because it's it's warm hearted it's not I mean it's not like ha ha but whenever I just just had to say that I was so\nThat she would love to the dentist Prager loved it I was supposed to be a machine and Bream last night and I think I said that on the radio but they had to cancel so I'm going to be unseen and bring tomorrow night which is friday Gray Thursday that's tomorrow night [noise] um\nSo I just wanted to say that it oh and also album mhm um we are we remember you know I was well I've showed it to you we have these he's my caveman\nA buttons right so it's like a campaign button and says he's my caveman which is to the at the end of the book\nUh they said him do you want to be king and he goes no he says you know I I I have a free people you're free your free your free people and and a free people held their leaders what to do and leaders have to do and they say you mean like a president he goes yeah and then goes if that's what you're looking for um your caveman so we had these buttons printed up to say he's my caveman\nAnd it's a Donald figure with a thumbs up\nAnd we can't sell them\nBut we can give them away and if you buy five copies of the book and send us proof of purchase two info\nAt Eric ma taxes dot com info at air attacks is dot com\nWe will send you five buttons for the five books I think that's what we're doing and if you send proof or purchase for ten

taxes dot com and sign up\nAnd you'll get it tomorrow and all the details are in there so I just really wants to make sure I got that in before Sebastian a enters the conversation\nAt with his booming voice in an hour to today since it Thursday out\nAnd this was your idea mhm this was your idea to do a throwback Thursday 'cause we a lot of times we have these gets on there so great we think we really should play that twice well every Thursday in our two we're going to play an encore and this is our friend odds Guinness a he has a new book out called last call for liberty\nWe're going to have him on um I guess in November will have him on again but we did an hour with him this summer and it was just tremendous so uh I guess I'm a\n... we we just feel like we want we want to play it again if you didn't hear it and even if you did hear it he's just like us or if it yeah yeah so um I just wanted to say that that's an hour to today a bright okay oh oh\nAlliance defending freedom yes\nUm we've been raising money for lines defending freedom now a lot of you know that they're a nonprofit organization they rely on the generosity of others bright\nThey provide free legal services for clients being targeted by hostile governments or states like jak Philips was targeted by the Colorado civil rights commission who no one elected and they basically said we're going to put you out of business because\nYou wouldn't bake a cake to celebrate a same sex wedding and he thought well excuse me I I don't bake Halloween cakes I'm a Christian if you come here and and you ask me create something for you or if it violates Marlins principles I I Can't do it well we're going to have him on tomorrow to to discuss this in detail on this program\nBut I I Want to say that alliance defending freedom stepped up to help them it would've cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for him to defend himself and his business he was basically going out of business I mean that they're going to put you in a business because wedding cakes are his\nA bread and butter to mix metaphors so so he really was suffering alliance defending freedom came in and took it all the way the Supreme Court in one seven to two so people think that this is some narrow conservative ruling no seven to two\nAnd so life is sending freedom did that for free and this is going on all around the country you heard about the deal with um\nWith uh the former fire chief of Atlanta uh Kelvin Cochran who's been on the program so that's what they do a there's another case right now that's going on in all of these things they do folks for\nFree which is why we have to help right so a ... more recently Washington state\nOr their attorney general decided to target a grandmother name barrel ... Baron Hill Stutzman\nShe's the owner of a local flower shop because she declined to create a custom floral arrangements for same sex wedding she felt that that violated her religious beliefs ATF stepped in to offer her legal support for free okay so this could be you or your neighbor your friend or your cousin or your brother\nOr the actual cost of doing the litigation like that were huge okay they did it for free if it happened to ... could happen to you so a barren no standing strong and not wavering here's a clip from barren out\nInto the freedom to that my kids are twenty three grandchildren and the future there's not a price on things that they can't find my free time is it it's a little warmer tomorrow it's going to be the way they're talking about fully into doing

understand that if you do not\nVote for him and for his candidates and if we do not hold Congress we're going to have horrific Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer chaos\nIn the nation's capital for two years

subpoena all through Supreme investigation author bucks to go shouldn't folks too often look for any end that's good for Americans but just because they hate though Trump ... the question on the ballot will be are you giving in to hatred or do you love this country it's really about the more complicated than that\nWell the irony of course that that the other side keeps talking about hate down with hate I've never seen so much hate in my life it really is dismaying it genuinely dismaying that people\nAre who they have all kinds of issues with this president ... good for you if you do let's

Daniel I'm and there's a chapter called\nWhat do you need to know about war tell us a little bit about that but the you know a lot about war and and and tell us your background in case people don't know you beyond just seeing your face or on Fox News that your pundit but you have an amazing background a it with regard to a military fighting\n[laughter] well ah you know I was blessed to come up with your ... is a sort of my life I call it on a warm day are found myself at a military base\nA on a selection cool boss I ended up a member of the British Army reserve in a in the middle eastern charging unit fell in love with that kind of life babbled in it in college when I started studying law systematically\nLooking at the evolution of terrorism did a PHD in that and then it was all of it

teaching a master's degree in the Catholic ...\nThen one day in June of trying to fifty and\nI got a phone call from Korea eleventh off of him if I'd be interested in it by getting candidate Trump all national security issue so that that that in a nutshell but ...\nWell it's it's why you're qualified to write a book with the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies you you know a lot about this knowing this chapter ... ah what do you need to know about more tell us a little bit about that because most of us don't have anything else in your background\nSo it was the first things first um where did you say the word war to America does it mean something quite different from if you say through European law somebody for ... when he said all through American thing I think ... images of prior to ... the\n... infantry tank battalions dog fights over the Pacific but if you look at that rate if you look at the last two centuries and I have a child in the book\nMore than eight percent of all conflict since the polio is what we technical term irregular warfare all unconventional meaning it's look the armies of various countries fighting each other\nIt is the only one nation sprayed fight against non state actor whether it's Stephen Decatur youngest us naval captain ever a fighting the Barbary pirates off the shores of Tripoli two hundred years ago it off the\nYou believe the end justifies the means and\nThat's how you get fascism communism about how you get even the caliphate\nWell it it's so beautiful too I remember the first time a I had you on this program we talked about something along these lines and I thought uh this is someone with whom I can discuss the deeper things because really that what you just said is indeed at the heart of it all if we understand\nWho we are what does it mean to be human it means to be made in the image of almighty God but fall in broken and without the messiah\nOf the scriptures we can never be redeemed so that the idea that we can be redeemed or or resurrected without the cross of Jesus Christ most Christians would sort of claim to understand this but I think that we have to connect it as you've just done to\nA global ideology there have been ideologies such as the one in which we live in the west here American style self government we have always recognized\nThat mankind has the capability\nTo be evil to do bad things so if you raise human beings up and think that they can be perfected we can be perfected and if only will do this or have this technology we can ... perfect our whole society that has led\nTo the Soviet gulag you just set it and it's led it led to the to the Holocaust and in our own age it would lead to a unchecked by people willing to fight or as you and I I'm\nA hope to do it will lead to a different kind of Holocaust and gulag there's just no way around it when you think human beings\nCan perfect ourselves without God it's really chilling I mean if the stuff of you know an entire novel\nIf you aggregate to yourself\nThe role of ... ... ... ... there is no limit to ... you will justify it in and you'll role as ... ... you can become the next ... if you think that it is up to you\nTo create perfect when you become ... and you will learn the third of your population um you'll kill anybody for example I mean this is John ...\nIs that person was a ... perspective goals is a ... and then build the state and he will be killed because that's what happens when you're like gold at the end of the those are the risks you I'm a civilization\n... it's an amazing thing and that's why I say it's wonderful to speak with you because I Want to educate my audience those people who don't yet know this have to understand then when we talk about\nA conservative view politically or we're not just talking about some issues we're talking about the deeper principles of who we are who do we think we are\nI mean listen there are strains within conservatism\nOr within a libertarianism didn't miss everything you've just said they don't get it they think that technology is the way forward and that that we don't even need to think about\nThese kinds of things they think that the free market is a kind of God that can be worship into the free market will deliver everything and and we always have to understand that the the free market\nOr in a free democracy all of these things have to be checked by morality by virtue we the people have to make these things work unchecked or we you know we can have a the free market in China and it can ... it can suppress ... and ... these are deep ideas Sebastian and I'm so glad that ah\nThat not only do you understand these but you're writing about them and speaking about them\n... this is a lot of the great lessons overlay Michael boat back to him and miss ... through Florida and by my libertarian friends capitalism free markets it's just about the invisible it's about the moral directs\nThat's right up market moods it's not you know the and the bottom line is ... is a ball\nConcept about twice for example having Google support the Siamese the tightest ship weathered censored websites\nUp but they may be making money for theirselves yup about his thoughts kept\nUp as well it it that you sort of have to ask are making money is the bottom line what if I trade slaves you know in a foreign market not and you know that's not okay with you can trade slaves do you mind can I trade in baby parts we have to understand that\nEverything has a moral component and at the end of the day the free market didn't give us exactly what we want which is better pornography or you know above a robot Brussels I mean the the the free market has no morality we are the ones that's supposed to have\nMorality and if we don't exercise our morality the free market will give us whatever we want even if it's evil so folks were going to be right back talking to Sebastian Gorka the new book is why we fight stick around [noise]\nNine nine him doing\nThis isn't about my freedom is about everybody three when the government can come in and tell you what to do and what to think and what you create and you have to choose

the left they they're the radical better left that they're not the left of of Nineteen Ninety or or even left of two thousand it's not the left of of uh Al Gore John Kerry I mean the whole thing has shifted when I'm Wondering is\nWhether if you can't win by violence\nAnd you can't win by arguments don't you have to move in other words don't people have to say that the the goalpost have been moved and so the argument needs to be within ideas that work right with with within the realm of ideas that work and so\nIt it's almost like you want to have a choice between this kind of conservatism and this kind of conservatism in this kind of conservatism because people are voting and they're saying\nI'm the left is out of ideas I mean I I I've never seen it so clearly you know it doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute but they've been a quieted\nBy ah by the loudest voices by the voices of inciting violence and that kind of thing and I think your average American sees this and that

time and your talent or to help us build what what's now become Socrates in the city but there's so much to talk with you about but I think I'm\n... years speaking uh here in New York on something I talk to you have called the magna car to\nOf humanity and I thought that would be a perfect place really to go today can we can you ... ... jobs will be by the union\nTonight on that on that phrase comes from rabbi sects who says that the genesis declaration that humans are made in the image of God is the magnet culture of humanity and it was the highest statement to the ... file a bowl was\nAnd precious ... every single human being\nRegardless of any of the description you might give them a close race size speed intelligence and so on is magnificent and terribly important today 'cause you know we talked about is the post truth generation sadly we're becoming the post human rights generation and is more important\nHuman rights are being undermined\nThe whole value of the individual is being undermined you'd think of a whole lot of modern views like multi cultural do some more utilitarian to some degree just go to the greatest number they have no place for the individual\nBut my concern times are looking towards singularity\nAnd post humanism those new high view human does to stand against some of the things that are coming so if you go back to see us loses the evolution of men he talks about the final stage of ... generation who think they will make people in their own image\nBut we're we're very close to that was a gene editing\nAnd so we better have a strong high view of human dignity it would just stand against some of the effects of dehumanization which are on the way\nIt's interesting because the use of the rabbi sacks a of England uh\nCame up with this phrase the magna Carter of humanity to refer to to the versus in genesis that say we're created in the image of God I guess my question to you because I I talk about these things of course a lot as you would guess but I Want to ask you where\nUm ... if somebody does not take the Bible or\nAs you know the founding documents of their their thinking from we're would someone get the idea that there is such a thing as human rights\nYou can't really do think from the universal declaration of human rights Nineteen forty eight it was partly paused enrolled motion to announce he has some and the death camp revelations and so on\nBut fortunately it was led by Charles Malik who was a strong Christian and it came out of a broad Christian consensus you wouldn't posit today because the simple fact is if you take the alternative views around today say\nA atheism cannot go round the precious most of individual human rights simply conned read books like John Gray straw dogs and he's quite open if God is did\nThe idea that we think we're different from the animals as much as what Peter Singer Nichols species as some you know it's the greatest mistake humans have ever made we are only animals and so on so that no she goes to the Bible and you cannot find it anywhere else\nSeems true freedom this way out you were cut flowers civilization other was\nThe roots of human dignity of freedom or quality

your a thinker All right and then I can say I'm a I'm a thinker\nA because I'm certainly not a scholar but what I mean by a leading with that is to to say that\nYou are aware of some of the contemporary thinking on these issues I'm really not I'm not you know well read on what philosophers and others are writing about this these days but we all well a lot of people know about Peter Singer and but but I guess my question is there's so many people who don't have a biblical\nView do any of them see that without the biblical view without this idea that the magnet card of humanity that were made in God's image with ... ... does anybody today who doesn't have a biblical view the where not having that you\nBelieve that there is there anybody expressing a some reservation about

in the last three years in a book coming out in October which is my biggest book on public square issues cold will last cold for liberty and I've been sweating away and then everything to do with freedom uh-huh\nAnd his publishing that independence day and that's ... that's coming out this fall mhm October so we we have to have you back for that and you know if that's the funny thing because\nAs Socrates city for so many years was somebody giving a speech\nAnd now it's it's conversations you know like this and it's it's funny because you're such a ... year one of these very rare examples of someone I don't really ever want to interrupt I just want to let you go but there are many people when they give a speech of toxins city or something I Want to say hang on\nI Need a moment of clarity I've got to ask you a question what do you mean by this are or were my that you don't really fall into that category I just want to let you go it was just true you know it's true but your your tremendous order 'em\n... you're the one that introduced me to the concept of the golden triangle of freedom I think a lot of people are because I've talked about it so much may think that I'm the one that came up with that idea but I always try always to credit you because it is such an extraordinary idea I remember when you talked about it in your book a free people suicide\nI was beside myself I thought how is it possible\nThat I have never seen this or heard of this it's just magnificent I Want to ask you where did you first come upon that idea because I don't you know you say well the founders the ... but I the founders never put it that way did they that ... that it's a a a you know a continuing cycle\nOf the globe to try and go through reading the found those who didn't put it quite that way but it's still there in the fund those yeah but partly my own thinking about the dilemma where we are today how we're going to keep this thing going right\nYou know but my new book somewhat different cars you know everyone says America is deeply divided we I've lived in Washington ... ... is\nThe atmosphere is toxic I mean the insults and as a daily just horrendous yeah\nHow can a great nation live like this well what is the deepest division you know people have various ideas of that and you know the late ... between the global those send the national hosts and things like that but I don't know to the deepest division is actually of of freedom\nAnd the nature of the American experiment\nAnd you have some ideas that go back to the American revolution which causes decisively biblical coming out of Mount Sinai and other ideas which are decisively enlightenment coming down through ... through ... through march to his own people and that\nThat's the real division and the liberal left is all that side and that will be the undermining the American experiment altogether I think we're in a very crucial stage but the problem is you know in the first great division that led to the civil war Lincoln addressed\nSaying we knew Lincoln like leader but he if he spoke like that too they would have residents so most people shrugged their shoulders and in a world of politicized Asian division an entertainment and consumerism with most people say well who cares\nYeah well I think that those people are\nExist in great numbers but I I I still believe that there are enough that it's possible for us um I Do and this was an English from Nike palm yeah well that's that's right but I I think um it's interesting when you mentioned Lincoln ... I mean and it's\n... it's because of you that I Know any of this stuff but when I was writing in my book if he can keep it about Lincoln what astounded me and again I first heard this from you was\nHis view his his\nHigh view of the founders end of that generation and of what we have here in America it's clearly what we might call American exceptionalism it's clear that he sees that we are chosen by God that we've been given this tremendous\nA gift that we must treasure not just for ourselves but for the whole world I mean it's clear that he thinks\nThat and I think today\nThe left would give lip service to Lincoln he's some great guy but\nHe thinks that and I think today\nThe left would give lip service to Lincoln he's from great guy but they never go to that narrative to them no full pro American down there is a dead\nAgainst it I was going to say but liberal project where the Capitol Hill to being a less liberal project which was anti America as understood via and since then America's being racist genocidal homophobic you name it\nAnd that's what the left believes today and it's and so the deadly well then of course she ... she was when Rudy ... go cold for what he called the long march through the institutions picking up ...\nI don't know who George ...\n... well ... we got time mock schools were revolutions treats failed never looked\nGrim ski set in jail in the trenches jailed by Mosul they figured out why didn't and he figured out what you needed was not a revolution the streets to protest Jared you needed cultural had Gemini domination\nMiddle was the elites yeah Rudy George ... the head of the red brigade he said what we need is a long much picking up now along much through the institutions above all\nThe universities the press in media and entertainment and that's for sight out of his lawyers fifty years later exactly and they won all three of question no question all ...\nDissent in the ranks I see you know cracks in in the cracks everywhere is crazy like I mentioned the transgender ism but\nBut of a chair but I think uh we we just have to do it we're in this fall we're hoping to um to do more ... and he's in the cities and I know at the very least you have a book or coming out last call for liberty when did when is that coming in October October second\nUniversity press last call for Libby so this is a big book my biggest book on public life really ... and you've been writing for three years you know longer than usual yeah so and how big will be ... not that\nLong it's threatened to eighty pages to let him about it but most soldiers into this\nAnd even the publisher very time they called a ... magnum opus on freedom you're in a book on freedom\nIs a checklist ten questions for Americans to ask themselves by freedom because many of views around today a dangerously wrong what are some of those that well the I think of something that's not dangerously wrong but libertarianism is abused is unsustainable [noise]\nAnd in ... burst\nAmongst those interviews who's been my reading to you\nFrom a column and nobody will go to a second column in the Washington Post they have a feminist column\nIn the Washington Post where are women were feminist or one I think in particular a feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them on the plane last night\nAnd I I shared some of them with you know some of the quotes\nI think that these are so important to wonder stand the damage\nThat feminism ... image if each make believe world ... ... is ... ... from the west or make believe social blizzard his make believe and feminism is make believe he got what ... is make believe it's all make believe\nFor whatever reason and it's all psychological what how it's there's no other explanation there was a\nDeep deep deep uh\nOn happiness maladaptive miss\nReality on the part of the people who were braced these things and certainly those who develop them they have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse\nOr is the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea [noise]\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing\nRegeneration but overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is what character respect the characteristic of the left remember from the boat to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen\nShe writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to uh I'm not a leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she should they're interchangeable they have the feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nA but it is interesting that there's no mention in any of the columns by her or other women riding in this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so lonely to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the word marriage is not even enter\nShe's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a buck cheat the there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to which way he's from loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an ... an appealing\nTemporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what she described that I Know what I describe it to\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch she said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that lie became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put in bold for myself but underlying what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug it was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if they're managing the driver CDs a patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage or this and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy\nWell and then she wonders why she has never been so lonely in her life because what the feminist like all much to live and to make believe world\nReality it it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world where things will be better so she says if the if the man is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flag that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she said to ask permission for every move he makes fun of course that is exactly the way young men or talk today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe should let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this is they they have to say that they want their cake and eat it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important that every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and relief not personal appetite implying conquest you're going to move personal appetite for sex all the good obese care healing and relief sounds like a visit to a social worker or a therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy a different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October ... do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first states but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise] so she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh destroy the title but listen to this again\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional rooms that dating and relationships and memorably can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman\nTheir children left his two children the ... they don't want to grow up\nI Want to be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships inevitably can bring\nWhy don't you say that about anything else I'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that working for a living can bring\nI Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it negatively can bring\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart children they do not want it to grow up\nGrowing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms at all of that stuff\nThey are snowflakes some of them are even my snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups does it amazing things she makes this like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post how lonely she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI now I continue reading at that moment it felt difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of theaters feel stuck in the same dilemma really that's not true\nLeftist leaders are stuck in this dilemma conservatives haven't mature understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is a pain in life fish is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be at the end of may first\nOh by the way just a reminder the my my uh the the rational bibles the white five volume commentary on the first five volumes it's been so successful the we're going on the fourth printing of ... is the first volume was on the second book\nOr if the prices going up to five dollars 'cause of the price paper it's printed on very beautiful paper so you could still get the old price at um at Amazon if you want to get it and I'm just letting him do that is the rational Bible\nAt any rate uh I I [noise]\nThat book makes you aware that Jim is is this is what human beings\nTo grow up you have to leave the garden of eating the left wants to re enter

you now live I agree with you know ... percent right but at no point the she challenged feminism but it\nMay be her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with that particular person maybe their evolution as well I mean I'm a Democrat and\nI so I have to be left progressive um positions but I think when it comes to this and my relationship and kind of my\nSense of oh now you know I I Am a nervous they're scared to do that again that's like human\nEither ... or whatever I don't know that the whole right\nEye patch to one side or another politically as gets\nOkay All right I appreciate your call very much a cafe in Torrance, California Hi Cathy\nHi Dana Hi [noise]\nUm I just called to allow him a ... a story that I heard from a recounting from my son about five years ago he is\nNow how old is your son thirty two so you want to use our okay All right so\nIt's probably four or five years ago [noise]\nUh he was telling me about a attempting to date and he said he found young women so aggressive\nThat when you're trying to get to know them it's a little like a job interview they want to now I'm On\nHow much money you have in my kind of car you drive and what your goals are immediately you know not just a friendly let's get to know each other about a very aggressive grilling\n... so ironically if that's the case and I have to pass the word is but if that's the case so the argument that men will see women as sex objects is is is matched by women who see men as financial objects\nWhich by the way there is some truth to both not necessarily a terrible thing it just the way people were built we have to live with that\nWe have to figure out how to live with real life\nWith them if you do your cold or conservative\nAnd Dennis Springer show live from the relief
