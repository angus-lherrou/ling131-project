floral artistry for his same sex wedding and wouldn't you know the state of Washington\nIm after her as alliance defending freedom attorney Kristen Waggoner tells us to customers initially weren't upset but then uh the state's attorney general was the\nAttorney general contacts in the capital\nAnd they didn't find the initial complaint attorney general ticket on I can rely on their part to the

government and well bring about your personal and professional real and if you don't help celebrate same sex marriage\nMay remember if this could happen to a grandmother and shop owner Liberian

sex wedding\nPlease please do All right\nUm I uh\nI went to the ... and John concert I was invited by\nThe bass player for open John which itself is lunacy like the bass player problem John is a wonderful Christian who read my books and he invited me so I I just about painted I've shared that on the program I couldn't believe it so I I go a with a friend of mine we went to the concert\nAnd this this sweet bass player he kind of acts like he's a big nobody he's the bass player from John he's such a sweet humble guy Matt Bissonnette he takes us around he introduced us\nThe guys in the band they they'd been in the band since Nineteen Seventy and Seventy one the the um the bass player de Murray passed away years ago but we met the guitarist\nA David Johnstone due to the ledge and you see him you know who he was and then\n... will also in the drummer since Nineteen Seventy these guys if you watch like old documentary Johnny see these guys they look like you're Eighteen years old now they're like you know older men but it was such a mind blower but it it gets crazy are you ready for this are you ready\nGo go All right\nYou don't sound that excited are you OK on why am I don't want any I'm very excited I'm In New York yeah I'm In ... no no not I went\nWent to the ... so then uh the the Baker says hey let's go to the Iraq will seek them like be easier right and I thought yeah that was like what a concept to who's going to be at the ... gonna be like you out\nLike I don't know maybe a bumper to Hillary Clinton no joke she and bill had been there the night before because they were to concerts and Madison Square garden so I dodged the bullet we get to the VIP\nLoud and I look around I don't see anybody then a woman comes up to me and says your air attacks is\nWhen I said uh I'm In the open John VIP laundry Madison Square garden I don't expect somebody to know who I Am in that world right right she comes up to me she says she loves my books she met my wife in Texas He's from Texas she's here with her two daughters are like\nThis has been seen what what is going on [laughter] somebody came up to me and they and they said well we're from Dallas and we're here because our friend Heather talk and\nI said what wow she says he ... a friend Heather ... yeah well some people listening to this no already what I'm about to say right Ernie\nTop and is the man who has written the lyrics to every single Elton John song since the sixties the guy is\nLegend on par with open John ... so his wife evidently invited these people and so they bring her or and I meet the wife of burning ... I'm about to think because this is really like that to people who know who he is it doesn't get bigger\nRight like wow I'm about to ... and yeah and his wife his wife\nA Christian and she knows my books and she was all excited to meet me I couldn't I'm dreaming this is like a joke this is somebody spiked my punch [laughter] she then takes\nUs to meet her husband Bernie top and and I have to tell you if you had told me that I Would need Bernie top and I would never believe you because this guy is just I mean it was\nIt was such an honor and obviously the the concert was was phenomenal but the the whole thing was was was just amazing and then I had to race from there like I'm some big shot suddenly addict race from that to Fox News or I got into kind of a rhubarb\nWith Juan Williams yeah yeah I saw that a ha you know it was ugly up and you saw it I saw it you know he got when he got my backup he said some stuff\nThat I thought wait a second\n... you can't really believe that Juan Williams you know what he said he said he says well he says this president has nothing to run on\n[laughter] and I thought even if you despise this president which it's your right as an American but you can't say he's got nothing to limit that's that is crazy right now I got my backup anyway it was it was just it ... it was nuts and it got even crazier from there because you know\nA a after that my my book went to the top one hundred that Donald drain the swamp book and so anyway I just I I I'm all excited about this and I had had a shared I Am I'm getting at the school\nGirl that wrong\nSo am I I'm a [laughter] a port okay go ahead anyway though I'm In Fresno ... to ... this afternoon\nOr no actor night I'm flying back to Los Angeles\nI spent time with Victoria Jackson that was I was mentioning it was just the most wonderful time at world outreach a church people are excited about the Donald drain the swamp book like you never know when you write a book on until you know because it's a kids' book people don't know me as a writer of a kids' books are funny stuff but it's a kind of a fable\nFor all ages this is this is my takeaway as I talked to people it's like they they they're excited because it's a fable that explains it\nIn effect why we should vote for Donald\nTrump in the midterms like basically it's so simple even child could understand that\nYes yeah I Am and why we have to keep by the Republicans in control because it's going to well I mean exactly\nAnd it was even even at Johns mirror said even if you hate your the Republican congressman the problem is you know the the the pitch is so surreal in the culture right now in in Washington DC that if we don't hold Congress which we probably won't unless everybody\nEverybody right well that was the other one it it will yes go ahead\nWhat one was saying like acting like oh no no it's a president who's a uncivil here and it's like you were saying why wouldn't you you're kidding me you know you witness to yourself to see how people were like oh I\n... it's like this is what I'm saying it's like there's this you know they call it gas lighting like somebody like that that's something like that you look at them like wait a second\nI Know for a fact that not only not true that's crazy talk but it's almost like he has his talking points and he just has to kind of put it out there\nBut it it actually offended me because I thought that is so not true it's not it's it's beyond the point of view we're at a point now where you're playing head games with America that's not right if you're going to disagree disagree on the merits anyway\nYeah box will probably never have me back oh and uh I I just have\nTo say that um you know it was a it was an honor to uh to get to do that and listen you know I don't want to forget this before we go to a ... even though I Am all the way in Fresno, California\nWe are still doing a and I'll I'll say that so you don't have to help and I we're still doing a a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom and we are I'm embarrassed to say this we're way behind\nA you know we we kind of when you do something like this you say well we think we could raise this much 'cause our audience as excited whatever and\nI obviously overstated wildly and so we're way way behind so if there's anybody inclined to give to the alliance defending freedom\nPlease go to our website you know a website as much taxes talk dot com this is actually so important maybe part time after pastor Jeffress interview I'll get into the details on this but this is such an important thing\nI I Can't think of anything more important than religious liberty it's very important it's why we need to vote in the mid term uh got to do anything but an absentee ballot if you're

one another but I Know this you know they were so closely tied to each other you know the body the soul and spirit as somebody said if one catches a cold the other sneezes\n[laughter] I'm not I've not heard this I think you have to be a preacher to have heard all these kind of cool thing he just kind of weapon mounted a sermon but I ... I like that and it's it's really true I I find that I have been able to be attacked a spiritually when I have allowed myself to get tired or somehow depleted that I'm more\nI'm a more open uh\nTo to to just falling into whatever a bad place a emotionally or anything like that and sleep a\nAnd eating in and laughing and giving ourselves of break sometimes cause I Do think sometimes people confuse

good care of ourselves take good care of our bodies and our minds and and that that's just a big one so I just uh I'm Glad that uh we got to that when you're talking about ... under the broom tree\nUh it really is funny too because he has just come off of such a high and isn't that another thing that when when you've been through something fantastic\nRight after that often can be a very very down time and that's the classic case\nOr the absolutely perfect illustration and there's also another truth I mean illustrated there that we talk about and that's waiting on God's timing you know a larger had a big splashy came on the same really out of nowhere and first king Seventeen\nMade his big pronouncement the evil King I have it's not going to rain and then God sending off for three and a half years\nIn obscurity and you know a lie to hit really I think thought God was finished with him he spent six months alone by the work carrots and then two years with a widow\nAnd yet during that waiting time God taught ally just some in valuable things you know we want to move from one big thing to the next big thing from a big failure to a big success\nMany ... calls a time out\nAnd I say in this chapter waiting on God's timing waiting time doesn't have to be wasted time if we're learning the lessons God wants us to learn because many times God's not only working in our life he's working someplace else we can even city to prepare us for our next big thing\nAnd so really learning to wait on God is another secret for an extraordinary locks while\nOr we're going to go to a break folks or

it turned to news talk million Ninety and if you want to change your life in tune to five sixty WFL you do good or we can change the world this\nGod\nThis show is not going to Dr Robert\nJeffress about his new book choosing the extraordinary life God's seven seats\nFor success and significance who doesn't want success and significance we don't just want to believe that we're we're bumbling through an er like doesn't have any meaning by the way that's alive dot has meaning in store for you and purpose in store for you you need to know that and then need to figure out how can I determine that a doctor difference in in chapter two here you have\nA determining to influence your culture that is a huge one for me probably the biggest one for me to tell us about that\nWell again if you're going to have that extraordinary life uh it's important to understand God placed you where you are in the situation you are to be an influence for him and Eric you and I've talked about this many times they're just warped idea\nOut there and Christian circles today that somehow God doesn't care about the culture that the culture I wanted to hell in a hand basket and we can't do anything about it except to save our own souls but Jesus said\nHe's places here to be solved and light you know salt was a preservative it didn't prevent the decay of meat but it delayed the decay of make\nIt gave the meat longer shelf life\nAnd God is left is here as Christians not isolate ourselves from culture not to\nUh I identify with the culture and become like it but to influence the culture and you know when we say we pray those for all the time the Lord's Prayer we played by kingdom come by will be done on earth as it is being done and haven't\nWe pray that so often I Wonder if we've forgotten what we're praying\nFor we're not just praying for some future kingdom of God to come we're saying God we want your will to be done now on earth as it is being done and haven't I don't think it is God's will for one point four million children to be murdered every year in the womb I don't think it's God's will for\nA Christians to be persecuted and have their heads chopped off around the world I don't think it's God's will have war crosses from war memorials or Ten Commandments displays to beat torn down\nOr the name of Jesus being prohibited in the public square we are supposed to be an influence now I'll I just didn't think it was God's will for children to be burned on an open sacrifice\nTo the gods of bail and the ... he didn't think it was right for the people of Israel to be worshipping bail instead of Jehovah so he decided to be an influence in his culture and that's what we talk about it and how you can do that in this chapter\nSlow I Love it because I think that feeling that there's something you can do\nEven if it's a small thing to take a to take seriously the idea that God didn't put you on this earth just to exist\nBut to do something and that doesn't mean that the goal of our life\nShould be to do something and the number one bowl or a life of course is to be connected to God but if you're connected to God he wants to use you and there's something so I have to say the greatest thing in my life is feeling that\nGod has used me in some way if somebody says to me that what you just said or or what you wrote in the book or something I think that's why I'm On this planet and and it has such a beautiful feeling into to weaken touched the lives around us whether we're moms are dads are teachers where we can touch people we can change the world\nThey want to do right they would be miserable doing anything else\nGod uses desires and passion ting gifts to give you his direction\nFull that there's there's so much a in just this now I'm just curious because it's so humorous to me so at age five you said you were on TV and and the TV production bug beat you at age five that's very funny most five year olds\nDon't even know what TV production is I I just discovered about three years ago myself what the heck production is how is it that first of all you do it on TV at age five\nOh I hate to tell you I was playing my accordion on the Mr peppermint show the big show we're in the Dallas Fort Worth area can all those I was kind of a similar a semi regular on the mystery that permit\nTo that is so cute I could scream are you kidding me and\nMy first number words that downtown remember ... yup yup yup\nWhen we play we play it on this program all the time I'm not joking that's part of my bumper music when you look at the\nDimension up up in the way that was the very first concert I ever went to in high school here in Dallas at a memorial auditorium the fifth dimension\nKnock your memories you are not kidding I Love it I Love and also the idea of you I mean 'cause most people obviously they've seen it on Fox News whatever the idea of you as a cute as a bug five year old playing your accordion on the Mr temperament show is there is that available on YouTube best the cutest thing I've ever around that\nYou were trying to find and destroy all copies that may be and exist\nThat is so cute I cannot even believe that at age five you were doing that that's a restive and what what's the song you played a downtown I think that [laughter] so cute I cannot get over it that is incredible I I Want to\nSee this but so you were your your parents obviously pushed you to do this or or or allowed you to do this and you you did it and you're telling me that oh did you do more TV after that it was that it\nYeah yeah I did I did more I did that kind of you know growing up and then actually took my ... and up and make my money go into high school and college doing weddings and ... and everything else you played in some places I probably shouldn't have\nPlayed a and you know had a yeah I could I could play their bill poke and make tears come down\nYour [laughter] well I Know the accordingly huge in the sixties and and a lot of kids play the accordion it's not that ...\nYou don't see too many kids in it today but you're telling me you were in the Mr peppermint show I we didn't have that where I grew up so I'm just I'm kind of ... they sound so cute but so you something about that\nKind of got into you and what I find interesting too when you talk about the way God makes people you didn't think oh I Want to be on TV you thought I don't want to be a TV producer ... that just an amazing thing for a little kid to be thinking about that\nAnd and you know again the idea of broadcasting that's very important part of our ministry in the way we reached people and the business aspect you know it's hard to be a pastor without having some a business training in business accurate and in our particular situation here in Dallas First Baptist Dallas\nI mean you know we just did a hundred and thirty five million dollar new campus and it's very complex a financial operation and again I think God put that interest and those are made because he knew what he was preparing me for the key is God is doing that in every Christians live he's given those unique interest\nAnd passions and gifted this to fulfill his eternal purpose\nI Love talk of before we go I just want to see real quick how do we how was that the gods spoke to you when you were Fifteen about being a preacher I'm just fascinated with this you know I can\nPoint to that is the second friday June Nineteen Seventy wanted eleven fifty five AM in the morning now people say well is it an audible voice\nI say no it was lab urban that but it was an unmistakable call a God that I was going to be a pastor and entertain that moment when I say OK or yes that is what I'm going to do that comes for everybody wants to have that extraordinary live we have to say yes lord\nWell I just love it a folks the book is choosing the extraordinary life got seven secrets for success and significance and my final question we just got ... seconds or left where were you when that happened but it's always curious some people say God spoke to me are you in church where you at home\nI was actually a youth camp but not singing around the campfire combined\nYawn holding hands and all of that\nIt was actually the moon's surface the preacher had been up preaching I wasn't listening to a thing you would say really God was speaking to me and they sounded the bell for the service to be over and everybody to run to get in line and the lunch line and everybody's running past me as I was walking between that old Tabernacle where we met

Stutzman 'em out but I Know I Know you remember her story\nWhat over on the phone with us she owns a flower shop in Washington state right and she met her flowers out with a long time customer right who happened\nTo be gay and she declined I might might say politely to use her full artistry for this man's same sex wedding she felt uncomfortable right well the the customers initially were were fine with it but then the state attorney general\nYou know when I was growing up in Jersey my grandfather was a silly in such a Chilean people are like shelters they pretty much matter to a little bit away and so they can have a vegetable garden work and church family I mean for things and and that's it so why go Teaneck at the time of my grandfather was there\nAt least in New Jersey where he bought a little two acres back what it was far away and the New Jersey is the Garden State so I grew up in a small town and surely changed what what I was from what I was ... young for when I was older it just changed in fundamental ways and I went to University of Virginia law school and I was the first time I was in the show\nAnd then a friend of mine took me to Oxford who had gone to a whole mess and I said this may be one of the most beautiful towns in America I may one day have a family here and I do\nIt's a gamble now by the way does your wife know about this\nActually she's in Mississippi and so she you know oh you mean you have a family there with your with your wife because sometimes I don't like all my well my wife grew up in Biloxi I literally and got in the area I think um but she loved to many of the virtues of small ... up\nAnd I was just concerned you're one of those people that you know you were living to live your living a lie basically and I thought he got family in Oxford, Mississippi and his wife doesn't know about it if she hears about it on this program ... cook so you're telling me that you only have one white than one family thank God okay well\n... as much as I remember\nAs much as you right now [laughter] now at least he usually when you mentioned it's so funny when you think about\nSicily and then you mentioned documents to be I Can't think of two worlds in my mind that are more different when I think of William Faulkner and when I think in Sicily it's just like you know and yet\nUh I get what you're saying it's very interesting ... at ... Mississippi is one of the few states in a union that I still have not visited her spoken in I think I've spoken almost all of them\nIn the continental us I have never spoken to Mississippi now when I'm\nSure to Mississippi ... speaking you come down and spend a couple of days broadcast you'll you'll broadcast to sugar is the fighters space in America to broadcast in which is our studio\n... and I think you'll understand the premise that way the premise of my answer but\nThe substance of the show which is Faulkner always write about ... light right and it was what Detroit he shouldn't have written about cities and more than ... than should have written about the prairie\nWell it's it's kind of funny because when you describe it sounds it really does sound so beautiful and I love the south anytime I go to the south I feel like all Americans on some level a far from the south you know there's just something about just so American it's a lot more American than it feels to live in Manhattan\nSo I Would love to take him in and visit you and I I Want to talk to you today about anything you've written a lot of articles you do first of all tell folks\nUm what American I'm a ... what our American story he has he talked about on this program before but tell us again because this is a big part of your life and I I'm just fascinated with it\nI you know Eric I I've always thought that if you don't know your own story that is your family story or your country story\nWhy bother travel a lot of people in Europe I've been here and now I go to you know yourself right do you do your own state do you do your own country I Would prohibit anyone in my family from going overseas until they travel costs to cross across our great country why not there's so many great place to stay in your own country\nAnd so that the premise of our American story to ship all\nWe had a great stories to tell about this country great events great people often the people cause even sometimes events just happened\nBut who or what was our character what's our national character about what is this thing American exceptionalism or we don't use those words reaches tell stories and their stories about sports the arts and history a cherry street business history a ... and yeah I mean\nWhen you walk away from our show on ... hours a night to go wow what a beautiful a great country we live in what great stories we have federal law\nDoesn't want to tell great stories about America it wants to do every bad story about America so they show a streets to cleavage and by the way they were bad things that happen in America and segregation was one of them slavery was the original sin of the country\nBut but but those aren't the only stories right Eric ... I'd like to tell the stories that NPR doesn't show that's really what we're doing this or this or to like if the people making this American Life really love their country\nAnd how do people find a you your\nI mean I'm I'm Sorry how do people find our American stories have any mind it\nThis point you just type it into Google Search we come right up to the top of our American story there where you are and we have overlapping hundred hours of storage and you can build a category so we everything from you what you were doing that you know Eric it's amazing people send us in their final thoughts about their ... and every once in a while\nBut you'll see about a famous person it all started with all died and a friend of mine called and from Pittsburgh and sadly Jack Nicholas ... Arnold Palmer is going to make you cry I called up the Palmer family estate I said can I use that they said yeah how that\nHappened to have the skills to here's rich fills your cheap Arnold Palmer would make you cry and laugh at the same time\nAnd so from that we know that what you gee every week uh we do it at this day in history every day we do leadership segment once a week we do in American Dream respect when once a week\nAnd we do a lot of stories of the audience just send it to us and then we should we produce so our audience is actually the store a partial star of our shows\nWhy I just love this um so if people go to Google and type in our American stories this stuff will come up I just wanna make sure people got to find you and all and all that stuff we're talking about okay what are some of the stories we can talk about things that are going on right now you\nUm you you wrote a story called the great Chicago recovery uh can we talk about that because I don't know anything about that\nWell you know everybody knows the great Chicago fire and that happened on October ... Eighteen Seventy one\nAnd ... people show to know that it was a cow and a lot of theories about what started the fire or really started the fire Eric which at Chicago had grown from a little town of about you know three thousand Thirty years to a town of three hundred thousand because trains that started\nThe the the the manufacturing in America it started and it was shuttling moving to Chicago and they moved in so fast at such volume make do with all these buildings with no building codes whatsoever and they were all built out of work that on one particular arid October day\nWere when these holes were filled with would want to create fire ending winter ... for no which just destined to happen and third one thirty one third of the city to the ground over there were a hundred thousand homeless Chicagoans the banks all burned to the ground the retailers will burned to the ground and\nYet the story of the Chicago recovery was what I had to write about because it only a few years the city was built and there was no Illinois emergency management and there was no federal emergency management and almost nobody had insurance so for me the story was held back\nTo Chicago to it and the day when there was no one to turn through with fellow Chicago\nWell first of all you know when you talk about a fire the great fire of Chicago it it's hard for us to believe in this day and age\nHouse fires devastated major cities I mean this was a normal thing practically I mean New York was devastated a number of times I mean the great a Chicago fire courses are really the most famous but\nA ... ... it is interesting to think that that's not something we deal with very much we don't say oh you know Philadelphia is on fire and the whole city is going to burn down but in the nineteenth century this happened\nWhen we come back I Want to talk to you more about that folks I'm Talking to lead a beep or you can go to our American network dot org and find out our American stories our American

is bad right I mean big government a bloated bureaucracy New York's this the center of the moral on that I mean we had a reprieve under Giuliani a little bit\nBut basically ... under the new mayor or the Blasio we're we're we're we're getting dragged back\nInto that there are street people everywhere beggars in the subways are on the subway platform everywhere you go\nAh that's going on and so yeah Trump\nReally made his bones so to speak a ... in New York so what is fascinating to me that and then he understood why it's bad just because he was here which actually brings us to Chicago I mean here we are talking about the rebirth of Chicago after the Eighteen Seventy one fire and it's really a absolutely a\nA a testament to entrepreneur entrepreneurship or to the American spirit or to to the American can do attitude\nAnd yet Chicago today is you know one of the worst cities in America from for many reasons I mean there are many wonderful things about Chicago but it is really struggling right now I mean there's a tremendous irony there and it's very sad\nIt is that it got captured by the public employee pension unions right so that debt which no one can repay has nothing to do with the American critics character it has to do with free riding graft and extortion right\nAnd so what what got lost over time and what mobsters always do whether they work for the government offer the mob\nIs they're always looking to particularly big cities where they can capture free rent right and they can capture it through unions to public employee pension your news my goodness this is Chicago's problem and one day it will be able to pay the bills it's also New Jersey's problem it's\nAlso California's problem\nThe joy of the south is we don't have big strong public employee pension union so we don't have great state that states can't print money so here's a British I'll make it will make your audience that the red states are going to get lots of people moving to them and the blue states are going to empty out and federalism will save the country\nIt will save the country and the New York used to have forty five electoral votes it only has twenty nine Texas used to sit sit at fifty five people vote with their feet and they're going to vote for the state so that the best public policies toward that and this is a very good thing for for our future in the end\nAnd that's that is extraordinary a it take to hear you say that I I think you're right ah but it it is amazing to me Rahm Emanuel is not even seeking reelection it's been so bad that he even he wants out

truly don't understand that either they were rich but this will periodically tree or have bills are having a fair we're not rich sinners we're all sinners but you don't understand that but that was what if they don't know the first thing about what we are who we are\nAnd how faith informs our lives are so I just think because they don't know it they had a hard time writing about it's hard to write about things you know understand\nWell I I agree with you and as I said I think that some people are hostile or to say but I I Want to give people benefit that the way you do and say that most people they don't get it it's just a language they don't speak it makes them uncomfortable so they just kind of take a pass on it but it's so funny\nBecause most Americans do take face seriously I
