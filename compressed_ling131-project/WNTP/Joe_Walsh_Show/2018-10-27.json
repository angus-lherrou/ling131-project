and when we needed him\nAnd everybody stopped talking and it says in the year\nWhen people didn't talk about their experiences and the whole cost I seldom heard one person says there is no God get over it we're out around the next person that table says\nA ... that this was a failure\nOf other people look at all of our Christian neighbors they watched as we were deported in in my father's case watched as my father's father was murdered my grandfather was murdered and did nothing [noise]\nAnother person said you know what we can't understand the world Israel wouldn't have happened without the Holocaust show what greater good even though that's hard to stomach a greater good came from all from six million people being murdered\nAnd since then I've always wondered about that court question that people asked which is how can a nominee benevolent God allow evil on earth and so I've been in a way thinking about these questions since before I Would bar mitzvahed\nAt and they'd been bubbling with me and I've I've\nAs I've grown older I've heard so many people say that it's not\nRational to believe in God and rice with all we know about science and the history of the of the Bible and and modern morality\nAnd frankly I think that's totally wrong\nI've read all the books I read all the books that Richard taught not all of them but I read most of what Richard Dawkins route Christopher Hitchens Daniel dented even you've all Harare and I'm Steven Pinker and people would say well I read the ... and I'm an atheist or read I read ... Hawkins that I'm an atheist and I'd say\nYou have a really sat down and thought about these things and I\nYou know they geared if nobody doing it a\nIn a way that I'd like I'm going to do it in\nA way that are like now you where did you grow up I grew up in Chicago did grow up in Chicago um and you you were raised what as as a nominal do was was was was your Jewish faith a central ... in any way was this just something that you had privately going on\nMostly it was private so when my father arrived ... into the right one more I'm ... but just one more to more words about my father my father was liberated was sixty pounds um he had been slave labor he had been in the concentration camps and luckily was liberated by the Americans who nursing I'm ...\nPounds how sad is practically impossible to think of\nIf he had been liberated ... if he had been liberated a week later he would have been debt I wouldn't be here today I mean he was on the verge of\nDeath and so he had watched his father be murdered his uh his\nBrother was murdered his uncles were murdered my closest relative as a second cousin once removed basically um everybody was murdered\nAnd so she was one of those folks who was certain that there was a God and he was certain that there was a God because so many things happened during the course of him getting to Chicago that they couldn't have happened unless there was a God and his and his mind but\nHe was angry it got and\nYou know what he had a right to be yeah and I think that was done he so he didn't speak to ... went to services made sure we were there I ... on Russia's shutting 'em ... enrolled meaning Hebrew school but he wasn't going to sell God\nAnd I think they were both\nGod and my father were giving each other the silent treatment and you know I think both sides understand why we don't [laughter] wow wow wow wow\nOkay so so you go or you go into finance you have obviously been successful founding banks and a ... at what point did did you settle in your mind that you believed in God was that something that that that happened to your early honors or something much more recently as you're struggling with these an atheist books\nWell that journey started actually I was at the Chicago public schools in that journey actually started when I was a freshman in high school\nI went to I was we were doing the dissection I assume they still do the fetal pigs\nYeah and I'd had enough Hebrew school to know I've heard about the six day sort of thing and evolution versus creationism and I went up to my teacher I knew from us why a little bit he was which is a conservative Jewish youth group price and I said Mr do but\nI said we're ... we're learning about um ... you know how the fetal big ah you know goes through all the steps of it of its evolution right how does this square with the Bible\nAnd are already looked at me and he started a mother a few things and then he gave a shrug\nAnd I started thinking well look\nI'm not getting these answers here so was my ... by the time I was a junior I transferred myself into either crunch Jewish academy in Chicago and I said I'm going to at least know whether I Believe or I don't believe and that's really what started me I'm an attorney that's amazing\nAnd the funny thing is that on ... ... ...\n... is not even true I mean and this way and age you know that that second art and that that was based on those ah what is it that the heckle drawings that they're they're just you know these things\nGet picked up and they put them in in textbooks and they go on and on and on and you know fifty years later they realize oh that that's wrong right and meanwhile you have an several generations of people who\nWalk around it was on the test that's got to be right you know Pluto's a planet where do you want for me uh and then you really no no no that's not true actually so it is interesting\nUm but so yeah early on you actually decided that you wanted to know there are not everyone's like that everybody got crates assault differently but you really want to know what an early age so what happened when you go to college where you at any kind of a a a God worshiper in college where were you\nSo I um the the the important formative thing for me which was I'm grateful for every day is when I transferred the Hebrew high school I learned to read the ...\nAnd then opened up a whole new world for me or not that there's anything against reading the text in any other language yeah but for me it just made my understanding much deeper\nAnd I became a\nSort of a lifelong speaker I consider myself a hopefully a lifelong learner I there was no magic moment where I suddenly became observant right um it was something that happened over time and I really really needed to reason my way to every step you know why should\nI keep ... why should I keep kosher I'm not one of those folks who just does stuff because other people are doing it so it it it took me literally decades and in this book is is to some degree some of the research I did started decades ago I was I'm\nI'm I'm trying to reason out well\nHow do you square evolution and God how do you square the creation of the universe how do you square modern morality with what we read in the Bible you know people have\nTremendous criticism biblical morale and so I had it thinks are each and every those questions for myself well it's terrific or we're going to go to we're going to go to a break here but uh we are a\nTalking to Scott Shay or in the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism which actually so stick around you\nUm ... it becomes I dollars so he doesn't it yeah well\nEvery person is corrupt double and um we I think a ... not enough attention is given to the real meaning of the way we choose count at the third commandment course Christians kind of the second commandment\nWhich is not to take God's name and thing than to take I take the shot in Hebrew and it's the only of the ten commandments by the way for which there was no redemption of repentance that says that right in the commandments\nAnd what does that mean to me it means when people set themselves up ... sold spokespeople for God\nAnd we've seen that in history we currently whenever anybody says look believe if you don't ... don't believe in me because I mean believe me because I'm the soul I I can give you the sole answer to what God wants you can get in the same sort of trouble which is how\n... the is the religion or get in trouble right people say look just listen to me you don't have to go behind the curve don't bother reading the scriptures don't bother reasoning\nFor it right All right that that fast and then of course that was the ... the loser issue I wrote a biography of Martin Luther and it's so fascinating because you realize it at the heart that he wasn't really a\nA only was doing really was challenging\nThe authority of the church and the pope and saying look you have to bow\nTo a higher authority just as I Do and if you don't do that\nYou have no legitimate authority and they said oh no no you're wrong or we say goes right we are the ultimate authority where the ultimate arbiter of what God says or didn't say you have no right even the question at and at that moment you realized their goose is cooked when you when you have that when you aggregate yourself that kind of power and authority you take the place of God\nWhich is really creepy yes and deadly\nYou've got and that's but Luther tried to do and you do an excellent job of showing of of of demonstrating that is to reclaim the Bible would learn the scriptures on your own see what it says you don't have to take the local priests opinion and is it\nThat I mean it's a tricky thing right because you don't want to or\nYou don't want to say that everything is subjective that whenever your point of view is is valid no no no when I mean we're not saying that and Luther didn't say that right at the same time we do need to take the responsibility to dig in for ourselves and to be careful not to just to listen to somebody because they seem like they're right but to\nBut to understand that they are falling human beings as well and we can't a ... at the end of the day it's between us in God and it's our responsibility when we come back folks will\nContinue the

H. A. Y. the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism and it's got it's just great to to get to know you a little bit and to to see the work you put into this book I I\nAnd the idea because it's so close to my heart of trying to get people to think for themselves about what is right in true and I mean I think the reason you and I want people to do that is because we actually believe that if you do that\nIt will lead you to the guy to the Bible you'll say holy cow this is true and I think so many people don't do that they kind of take whatever they kind of you know ... from the guy says it blows by and they're not really going to go deeper if you go deeper you'll find that truth challenges\nThe guys that that ... where we are today or in the culture\nThat there's so much in this culture that is against God and against truth but we actually have to know that to stand against it\nRight I I a hundred percent agree there's so much bad faith part of the reason I titled the book in good faith is there's so much bad faith with people play their faith in all sorts of things that don't make sense the good news about the Bible and about ... about worshipping the God of the Bible\nIs that while you can never approved got\nThe God of the Bible is a Bible that is a God that is consistent with recent so we have a reason to put our faith in God people put their faith there was a recent Pew study of significant number of people in the United states I think that their spirits and rocks that they're all sorts of strange things going on in the world\nAnd what I've tried to do is to show that you can only provide evidence I mean there was no way to say you can prove there is a God and indeed I think and I go into the book why I think that would almost be a bad idea would remove moral choice from us but\nIf you but what I think is\nI think that if you spend the time and do the digging that the evidence for God the evidence that we can fight is totally consistent with God and I said that from science I'd say that from the history city the Bible\nI say that from understanding our modern morality and when we don't have God as part of the equation when we place or when we place bad faith like facing I dollar tree or faith and things are faith and money lowly\nUm we can go and a lot of bad directions and that's really when the horse start and unfortunately we've seen too many of them throughout history ...\nWell ... it's fascinating to me that uh you're coming from the perspective of a of a believing do usually the argument or is with a somebody like me a Christian versus atheists but you're you're coming at it from a slightly different point of view and you're not arguing for the a divinity of Jesus uh\nYou're you're talking about God and the Bible in the most basic sense and you have\nDetermined uh through years of study that it's true it's really his wrist the the Bible that to me is one of those fascinating things the idea that centuries past and the more we discover the more true the Bible is known to be I mean we keep discovering what was it Fifteen Years ago the steel at\nThat I Know I mean unfortunately the ten commandments that not actual video footage of the mayor and I know we take it to buy on\nIt's yeah it can be but I'm sure everybody pressed up against the water rising away to walk maybe it was a little ... I was a little ... but I'm sure they viewed it as a miracle that wrote down that way right\nWell see that's what's so interesting is that you know when you talk about what is a miracle or if God's hand was involved in it I mean if you're standing there and there are six million of you and you're about to be killed or whatever by the Egyptian army and suddenly\nHey there's a place to walk where there wasn't a place to walk twenty minutes ago something happened and let's go this way and he was scape and then pharaohs army has drowned in the very place where you to most people would say that as a miracle\nAre now the details of the details and you're you're giving us some more naturalistic explanation I Know a lot of people would disagree with you on all kinds of ah things some would say that the whole thing never happen but it's fascinating I Love this is why I wanted to have you on because\nTalking about this rationally and saying look we first of all we don't have a dog in the fight whatever happened happened we just want to know what is right and a\n... some of the stuff we can know some of the stuff we can speculate on and if we're wrong well it is what it is you know it's not like it has to be this otherwise my faith crumble but what you're talking about it's fascinating I I mean I've heard of this before but you you're a you write about an in depth and this book\nAnd I think by taking the tech seriously to and really looking at the words yeah I think there are some things that we take for granted that\nA mini believers think that we have to question I think the numbers six hundred thousand is relate males so I analyze what the word is it's it's ... it's six hundred thousand in in ... is how it's in is how it's written but when I went back\nAnd spend some time and read a number of a philosopher just review aloof\nAs you may know the Bible at the ... the tower was waiting without vowels which is makes it hard\nDuring their browser very rare in those days did very expensive hard to come by and they're handed they had to do with what they had\nRice correct you know there were words like aloof which could have been which A L F aloof which could have been pronounced the number of different ways and could have meant something very different than ours and equipment\nBattalions or groups are clusters so the likely scenario is that they weren't two million ... Israel lights crossing but more like fifty thousand and then if you read closely all of the other counties\nIn the Bible right the number first born which is two hundred and Seventy three groups that are\nPut aside and you look at the lines to make sacrifices that are much more comports with the ... I like the ... into it and you're not always going to come out where you want to I said I Want to come out and say oh it's six hundred thousand\nWell right you know you have to follow the road and let you take let it take you wear a tale your vast rash of\nMe that that we have this up to a gym and we have the ... gate\nAt it but you're going right back to the Hebrew and you're saying that no we don't know it's not plane it's not clear it could be this or it could be this\nAnd uh it bears looking into and maybe the answer is we don't know but here's some spare some possibilities I loved that because again you're taking it seriously you're not saying saying oh this is what they've always had and it's got to be this and you know and and I really think that\nThe Bible can hold up to that kind of scrutiny that there are a lot of people that are told like no don't look too closely\nOn the contrary look as closely as you like if this is the word of God\nYou can let this closely Z like you'll learn something that you didn't see before\nYou must I mean I'd rather talk with someone who is questioning and his will and it's all been right I mean some people are closed I've I encountered atheist in Canada when I talk to them and if I start to give them one of the blurb or steady gay people doubts about their doubts if I start to do that\nThey shut down yeah and that's a dangerous thing what can they have their own religion and they're not interested in you know having that the bumped right and I mean I think we also have to question our own religion each and every one of us I mean there's plenty of stuff the Clintons in every store that I don't know but\nThat's why when people say like a I Am I'm an atheist than I but I go by science and I think well what do you mean you go by saying you think Christians don't do you think Jews don't the point is we can talk about the details and we can quibble and argue whatever but everybody a supposedly is being rational\nEverybody believes in science so that's that's just stop is free to say I'm for science I'm rationality and you're for religion\nThat's not that's we're going to be right back folks for final segment with Scott

Dr Shay is the author of in good faith questioning religion and atheism fascinating conversations got you know now\nThat I realized that you're uh you're\nFrom Manhattan we've got to get you back in here and continue this kind of a conversation because there's so much to begin to I mean when you talk about uh how this Hebrew word might be that word of that word it's a funny thing because when when you think about Hebrew being written without vowels I mean a lot of people think what\nNo vowels how does that work and I think the same is true of many ancient languages I I've been studying Homer\nA and the odyssey and and you realize that\nThis may have been written in linear be right in the building or be with the language of the ... there was a ... big language and you can to all these\nUh I really think delightful battles in conversations about what this word might have been and that would make its really delightful to get into that and so but you so you've been a really deep dive here into the Bible at what point did you did you say to yourself\nI Know that this is that this is real that this is true that that that this these books uh but that comprise the Bible or or we'll was was that something happened bring recently or was that as you were when you were younger man\nYeah absolutely so ... Thomas is a mother and Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as girls are allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very bad\nPolicy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show but we've been talking about what the dangers of\nAdopting these policies of schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluids I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the ... elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl\nI mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nThat the school district\nPolicy made this possible it was a\nPass sort of under the cover of darkness oh about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of\nWhether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect the desires of the child and it said\nIn this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom does a young boy that identifies as ginger fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\n... he was also he was actually in the same grade as Pashtuns daughter answer given a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but what the the bigger problem is the school and a blend assemble\nWho but who ... who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but under the school policies in indicators unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today the schools essentially say okay\nWe're not going to question that we're not going to determine whether that there's a better accommodations we can\nThat we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nRestroom or facility you want to know regardless of the impact it has on other students\nWell it it's just a stunning thing that it's possible\nFor a little girl I'm to be exposed to anything of any kind of a sexual nature when she just wants to go to the bathroom I mean the fact that because we all know that there are very troubled kids out there we don't know or anything it seems about this boy but the very idea that it's described as something\nOf a sexual nature at this age it's just horrifying but you're telling me that the school\nHad this policy so they could not stop this boy from going into the girl's bathroom\nNot only that but after all of this you would think the school might reconsider\nIts policy it hasn't done so you would think the school might\nEven to say look maybe we ought to make sure posh his daughter and this boy you're no longer in the same classroom that didn't happen as well it left Pasha with the only option of taking her daughter out of that school something any parent would do when the school was so unresponsive to what happened here and that just shows that this is this is not about\nYou know trying to keep the students\nInterest first what it's about the school\nStanding by this and very dangerous unsafe policy even in light of evidence of the harm it resulted in to pass his daughter\nWell I think what you see happening over and over ... is that people have no courage when it comes to these kinds of cultural issues in other words everybody knows right now the easy thing to do\nIs to go along with the sort of you know transgender trend and if you buck is people are going to say what are you are you a big it and so typically people in authority school authorities people in corporations\nThey have very little courage in other words they just want to do whatever they need to do to not get in trouble and in this case who's going to suffer the kids so so they're not doing their job\nAnd they're forcing this mother to take her little girl out of the school because they refuse to do their job\nIn that strikes me as a what is happening here\nYeah that's exactly right in the school has a lot of options that it could have offered to this young boy a dove given him a single user restroom that he has access to but what it should never do adopt a broad sweeping policy that says use whatever restroom you want to go in there with a little girls are in there and that is the danger\nOf these policies is rather than taking a stand and say no we're not going to compromise the privacy and safety of our other students were going to find solutions but\nWe're not going to do it at the expense of everyone else they took the route to say no let's just adopt is brought sleeping policy let's not have the courage to take a stand and say is is really best for all of our students\nAnd we're not going to do anything to compromise the safety of ... daughter and others like her\nI I didn't think when I when I grew up a there we would be in a world that is in some ways a crazy that this is craziness when you when you cannot\nUh have a common sense to say is it a five year old\nShould not be given the option to identify as anything other than what he is which is a little boy the idea that this kid is gender food I mean the question is did a doctor say that he needs to be a treated this way did his parents say it we don't really have those facts but the idea that\nThe schools are so afraid\nOf doing something wrong that they're allowing this to go on it really is a kind of madness I think we have to call it\nWhat it is it's a kind of madness a but it has to do with religious liberty in this case because ah\nAs lengths defending freedom or has said over and over and over uh the people who believe that the men are men and women are women were were were being treated like where this crazy minority when most Americans understand these ideas about these transgender\nTrends have just been pushed on us and here you have a case where\nA this woman pastor Tom is uh is is not being treated right now what what are you in what is the ATF looking for in this case because he said that this woman I'm a I mean who who is suing whom and what are the details of that suit\nAs things stand right now we we had worked with posture to file a complaint with the federal government with the department of education office of civil rights\nAnd we were encouraged to see that the federal government is taking a look at this and launching an investigation into the school district because their concern is not only is you know this is a a a dangerous policy but they the school district may have violated federal law by adopting\nThis policy not responding appropriately to to what happened in and creating a hostile environment for\n... daughter and and other young girls at this school so that's a bright light in all of this is that we now have a federal government that's taking these issues seriously and so we're going to continue to work throughout that investigatory\nProcess uh but at the end of the day what we're wanting is a good policy in place one to ensure something like this doesn't happen when that ensures that girls showers locker rooms and restaurants are reserved for girls ... and the young men and boys don't have access to them\nHang on one second folks are going to be right back oh we're talking with the alliance defending freedom is

weren't for you and the folks alliance defending freedom doing the hard work of of taking these cases on for free and defending them\nThese people would be hung out to dry Pasha Thomas you've just described I mean nobody is standing up for her and the whole school system is telling her hey you can go jumping a lake Pasha Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've seen this happen to a young five year old girl is a result of this this was avoidable\nHad the school district recognized the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board saying wait a second should we be adopting this policy um but it's taken ... ...\nPeople like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're gonna take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just posh and her daughter not just even the kids indicator but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to say how\nI'm going to the restroom or it ought to be a place of safety especially for young women and the idea that somebody can go into a place like that an avid physically strong mail whether it's the same age or older\nUh but but attack them or something like that that that shouldn't even be possible and of course here you know it it's a situation we don't know the details but\nUh it seems that it could be so much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about this general principle and you think about teenage kids and it it's just it's just a nightmare waiting to happen unless we have\nUnless reason prevails and unless a cool minds prevail in courts of law and we have folks like

need your help right now you can go to my taxes talk dot com and you can give right there where there's a phone number I'm now ... you know I I just want to say that a few years ago\nI Would hear people bring up cases like this like the case of of jak Philips and now it's kind of roll my eyes and say you know the people always they're always complaining about these these are these kind of fringe these crazy stories and\nAnd the time has passed and I think to myself\nYou know I'm I've met jak Philips I've met a who was it the the other the the the bakers of photographers\nWho ... practically lost their business because all they did was say where Christians we cannot participate in a same sex a wedding ceremony it goes against our values against their religion\nAnd those people are told hey shut up do is you're told or we will sue your rear end you know all the way back to zero you will lose everything now\nWhen I when I really understand this I think this is the definition of an American in America you're supposed to have choices and right now people like that are being told you better do this or you lose everything now I Want to go back to Jack Philips a tell us the story about jak Philips and then I'm going to talk about the new case the jak Philips has\nLed to jak Philips has a cake artist and does incredible designs\nOn a variety of things but he's always operated consistent with certain ... certain cakes he won't designed he won't use utilize its artistic talent for and so things like I'm celebrating Halloween that he doesn't like the\nYou know devil imagery and all of that stuff or a cakes that are a denigrating the American flag or or mocking any group of people will he was approached by a couple that asked him to do a cake celebrating their same sex\nUnion and jak politely declined and said you know I I Can't use my artistic designed to to create a cake that celebrate something that I think\nViolates God's plans for marriage and as a result he was sued by this couple and the state of Colorado a and fought all the way to the Supreme Court losing it every step of the way and we were able to represent them free of charge and gets to the U.S Supreme Court in the Supreme Court says no Colorado you cannot have hostility towards jacks beliefs\nHe's entitled to those and you're a efforts to to denigrate those and punishment for those is unacceptable and said that's where it ended up that we thought was the end of the story was that Jack was going to be indicated in his right to work and create art consistent with his beliefs\nRight so that that's step one right so um I've met Jack and you know he's he's like the definition of a normal guy he's got a business and you know that this ugly moment in history found him\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court\nUsed jacks case against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his\nBeliefs this isn't about letting him continue to operate as a business and serve every body but\nGive him the freedom to decline certain cakes bits of saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that um your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff that I'm telling you folks ah one we're fighting a civil war when we were finding the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is the battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid uh the people on the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans it's it's just not right and but we have to stand up so the least we can do I as I said his vote\nA please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't\nDo that so many people have such excuses please or if you don't vote don't ever complain again\nA and I want to say uh if you can give to the ... defending freedom I don't know anybody that is doing this a kind of work right now so I Want to say go to a tax us talk dot com you'll see the banner every penny you get will be doubled up please give what you can visit folks this is why God gives us money\nAn energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it it's tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way uh eventually they're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values are you going to say uh where do I turn well\nUh I like to think you could turn to the orange defending freedom so the number in case you don't have a a website you can go to my taxes talked dot com it that's difficult\nOr you can call one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six twenty seven\nSeventy a mat sharp uh what else are we looking at what other cases are out there right now because this seems to be never ending\nThat's right I think one of the other big issues we've been working on dealing with a adoption and foster care providers\nSo we have a a crisis in our country with a four hundred thousand kids in the adoption foster care system about a hundred thousand kids\nAre eligible for adoption and we need organizations out there recruiting families training them helping to connect kids with forever homes but the same uh\nEffort to punish faith based organizations just to the same hostility we saw towards the jak or nothing towards these agencies and so in Philadelphia in Massachusetts in Illinois and other places faith based agencies have been shut down run out of business\nSimply because they want to operate consistent with their view about the best environment to raise a kid that every child deserves the mother and father and so at the same time for example in Philadelphia that the city was saying we desperately need more foster care parents are just a few days later they were shutting down by Catholic social services because\nThey didn't like Catholic social services views about marriage and this again shows this ongoing hostility and the impact it's having on kids that they're being denied of organizations out there working to find them homes they're being denied of these families that\nWould have been recruited all because this effort to push an ideology and for the government to punish those that don't like that they don't like their beliefs\nI have to say if this doesn't make you mad folks if this doesn't make you mad I I just assume\nYou're not listening because this is\nHorrendous and the only good news and that's why I'm here folks I'm not here to complain is to say you can do something about it one of the things you can do and I hope you will do\nIs give to the alliance defending freedom it doesn't matter what you give give something we've got
