I'm going to be a new she wouldn't be doing a lot of stuff it but this morning I had to get up early because I was on the blaze radio the blaze of course is Glenn Beck's empire\nAnd people know that he had an empire he has an empire and he is now actually officially an emperor oh yeah he carries a stepdaughter yeah ... or ... or ...\nAh yeah he's the emperor of ... dot com and fortunately wears clothes so yeah that's the most important thing and so anyway I was on the radio this morning with doc Thompson he's got a rate of progress has also on TV you know so if you watch funny guy ... yeah exactly and so if you watch that uh you've already seen me talking about\nDonald drain the swamp but I'm excited you know every time as an author that a book comes out I I just get excited to see how people are going to reach receive at Michael Dell of my pillow is creating pillows based on this book\nI'm not I'm not getting the bills you sleep on but he's like what are they call them that they take everywhere pillar to take it anywhere like airplane you take them on the point I don't know he's got three hundred because it's like you could read it as a bedtime story and you got the pillow right there to go\nYou know yeah exactly uh but any way it'll probably more like a couch accent pillow or something like that when you're creating a Donald drain the swamp\nPillow that's Michael ... Michael ... by the way good time for me to mention that one of the sponsors on this program is my pillow and if you'd like to get my pillow with a big discount you put it in the code Eric for Mattel access if you don't put an Eric Irma taxes\nI don't think you're going to get the discount so if I were you I'd put in the code Eric or ma taxes either one I think uh but you if you want the big discount you got to put that in but I'm I'm excited that that Mike window you know he he has supported this president and all of his pillows are made in the U.S in a new and um\nHe's of course based in Minnesota but he he is the\nUltimate American success story is so incredible what what Todd has done in this man's life is life was a mess who absolute mess and he is just it's amazing so I I just think it's wonderful east creating a pillow\nOr with the Donald a character the caveman character on the pillow uh that's that that you know it's going to take some time before we can get those manufacture but it won't take too much time but the book down bring the swamp is based on a true story\nAnd people who read it will recognize like oh yeah no well yeah that sounds very familiar and at the end the Donald caveman figure he doesn't George Washington type thing where he issues being the new king\nAnd he says no you don't want to king you're free people now with a free people don't have a king a free people you are the government you tell your early years what to do and they say\nOh you mean like a president and he goes yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your cake and what's really amazing this is five thousand years before George Washington yeah minimum age and the case\nDrawings or by Tim radical in yeah Mm yeah it's amazing 'cause he's he's a alive now\nSo anyway down brings us this one is is coming out I Want to mention I'm also a folks that we're doing um a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom some of the you know you've heard me talk about this but\nAt its like our friends Sebastian Gorka says you know his the title of his book will talk about ten minutes called why we fight we've got to fight and I think the other side the enemies of religious liberty are fighting really hard because they think they're fighting against bigotry now I'm here to tell you that\nThey they're not fighting against bigotry but they think they are and so they fight really really hard and and they're damaging uh our our government basically and so you you've got to fight back\nAnd so when I think uh for example we talked to our friend who was the the fire chief of Atlanta he lost his job people attacked him and he lost his job why because he dared\nHe dared to publish a small book\nThat mentions this was for his men's Bible study that mentions biblical view of sexuality people said oh that's bigoted and he got fired from his job as the fire chief of the city of Atlanta and the alliance defending freedom defends men\nLike that actually we have a clip from Calvin Cochran here here is that the the Atlanta fire chief lost his job talking about it here it is\nI Would gladly lay down my life in service to save another life because that's what firefighters do the one thing we should not have to sacrifice is our God given freedoms the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion\nThese freedoms but with so many in our nation have sacrificed suffered in that we shouldn't be forced to surrender\nIsn't an incredible I mean I've met him a number of times he's such a noble figure he ... he's a he got fired ...
