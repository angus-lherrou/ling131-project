V.\nSo this is like amazing to me tonight I'll do Shannon Bream\nBut I have to say that folks this makes me feel like we could take down Steven cold there is even called there has a nasty it's one of these classic nasty anti Trump books and you know what you don't have to like Trump\nBut for crying out loud that the nastiness the snarky in his\nHis book is number one on Amazon yesterday and I thought aren't there enough food like Trump who could make my book\nDo better than his book I mean honestly it's crazy 'cause his books about even kids of my book I'm hoping that people will actually buy for for their kids and for adults it's like one of those I mean it's it's it's a kids' book that works for everybody at first I just thought of as a humor book for adults but of course it works for kids right\nSo the weird thing though is that his book\nYou wouldn't give it to a kid because it's just snarky adult humor it's not meant\nFor for kids is not innocent and sweet it's kind of mean so anyway so if you uh by Donald drain the swamp you'll you'll helped me\nOr take take Stephen Colbert down a notch you know 'cause he's got to he's got to be taken down a notch and I feel like I'm just the guy you can do it too so a year that I [laughter]\nI I Would probably like him if I knew him but I don't know um so anyway uh I I just was so excited yesterday wanted announce it to the audience that's a big deal to get in in the top one hundred when you haven't done TV or anything like that so I think the book is catching on\nThat people who've gotten to see it are are starting to buy you know more copies and stuff but anyway I just want to say that also got to say that this is this is a this is madness we have created\nCampaign buttons that say he's my caveman\nAnd we're not selling them we've also created stickers that say he's my caveman because at the end of the book Donald says if you're looking for a president I'm your caveman because they want to make him king and like George Washington he says you don't want to change your free people now you don't need a king\nYou need you need a leader who who listen to you right you're not going to listen to the leader like ... or dictators bureaucracy you're going to tell your leader what to do and the leaders got to do it and they said you mean like a president because yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your caveman so we bring you know these are these stickers in these buttons that say he's my caveman\nAnd they're kind of red white and blue they're big they're like over three inches in diameter\nAnd the only way to get them at this point\nHis to buy if you buy five copies of the book and send us a roof or purchase now the book is like Thirteen dollars on Amazon but if you buy five copies of the book and send proof of purchased us that info at Eric ... attacks US DOT com info\nAt how much access dot com we will send you ten buttons now these believe me folks these are big beautiful buttons you probably pay five bucks for one of them but we want to do this we want to spread the word so if you buy five books you get ten buttons if you buy a hundred bucks you get\nTwo hundred buttons bowl\nI just did the math in my head it's two buttons per book but it's got to be at least five two buttons for books are going to be doing that\nI just fell off my chair ally carrier and hit my nose or\nAre you at your nose again man so low you you'd be sure you have that card arise well anyway I Want to say that this has really um exciting for me because these buttons are very much they're fun Michael in Dell is creating my pillow with the he's my caveman motif on it we're we're creating a plush I still haven't\nHaven't seen it but it it's just a it's a lot of fun and I I just hope that people will

December yeah go ahead go ahead Jack [noise] you know you go ahead okay it was like nobody I Know in December the fifth December the fest okay it\nSince I was Seventeen so almost a year ago we went to Washington DC so the court room where we saw it goes for Gorsuch Kennedy Roberts Alito all of them\nAnd it was the other two let's be clear with the seven to two decision seven to two\nOkay now there's a big thing I Want to say that again are we in America need to understand and this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided ideologically or politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices\nAgreed the Jack was wronged you still have to fight these legal battles it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong you'll be figured out right away no the state of Colorado get this totally wrong you guys have to argue at all the way the Supreme Court what would that cost a match sharp\nIn legal bills if alliance defending freedom doesn't exist and somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved because you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and it's\nThe best part of my job as it were able to look at someone like jak a hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding our whole person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business

principles in that book of course it's not like I came up with them but I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know um what it means to be an American and how precious it is\nAnd so what we're describing your religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberties the rarest thing are really never had an a nation to Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh\nWe've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have a both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people fighting\nUm the thank you for I'm referencing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you or you become a hero to so many people because to have to go through what you've been through um you\nDid not pick that says we just said you did not pick bears and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom who knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined a and we have to stand up and fight so now Matt let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so it it's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all the civil rights commission it's hearing or it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this um so that jak doesn't have to\nBe dragged through the same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is it can you say\nYeah so we're in a federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but if not it will go up to the court of appeals and potentially back to the U.S Supreme Court but we're hoping that\nUh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado and\nAnd is your feeling that uh the the president of the ruling the seven to ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nGas or when the Supreme Court sent a clear message that tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't\nBring these proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks after that ruling Colorado's back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law we think that's a strong demonstration of the exact hostility that seven members of the court\nFound to be problematic and so I think that's a strong precedent um there were going to rely on and and hopefully the federal courts will look at that and say yeah this is too much hostility this is unconstitutional um and and dismiss Colorado's charges against jak for gender identity cake\nWell I mean I Want to be clear ah for folks listening that you know Jack your\nChristian ... you're not an anti gay person you are a Christian with all that goes along with that so if somebody comes to you and says I'd like to bake a cake that says I hate gays because you're a Christian you would not make that cake either\nThat's correct and that got people with similar requests like I'm just not going to do that work daughter God Jesus Christ in every way that again and they can't do that I Can't honor him making cakes or hateful or go against is teaching [noise]\nSo I Want people to hear that because you you hear so much um [noise] you know ... obviously we're living in a time where are the news is very confusing and people say things and it's not corroborated but it gets out there and\nUh people try to paint folks like you or me for that matter as a bigot and you think well not only am I not a big it but I fight bigotry in my life I care about these things just as you do or we may differ on our definition of bigotry but we don't take these things lightly\nAnd there are hateful people out there and you're not one of 'em and by God's Grace I'm not one of 'em and I think people even saying we're talking about religious liberty this is not the liberty to hate this is liberty deliver our lives according to the

Davy Crockett\nWe had that kind of character but very different than the earlier president say we'd had\nAll right and so how does he um what what are the things that he did a that would make people hate him or say that we should take him off of a twenty dollar bill [noise] yeah well\nSo the two biggest things of course that he's not guilty of this low new or many people who are guilty of this he was asleep older he owns a number of slaves obviously slavery from any perspective is immoral and it's an evil\nBut even with in that ... that is he was seen as a ... and with an evil system he was seen as a bear winter slave holder and certainly\nI don't really know I I guess I don't understand sorry to interrupt us and say I don't understand\nOr know how that becomes an issue because obviously all of the people of that era were slave holders so we know it's a horror but it really doesn't you know like when you think about or any of them George Washington and Jefferson and and and all of them are they were slave holders so I guess I'm thinking they're ... something about him\nThat goes well beyond simply being a a slave holder in an Arab slave holding\nFlight so I think that gets lumped in generally with Indian removal and the fact that not only at a bit at a bit of slate older but he removed all of these Indians for native land's what she did a there is no doubt about\nThat when I when we come back I Want to I Want to dig insurance because that's the one thing that's a big knock on him\nA ... so to speak that I've heard many times and I want to I Want to get into that\nA ... a to a professor of history and American studies at Hillsdale College you can go to my taxes for Hillsdale dot com we will be back to discuss the life of Andrew Jackson with the author of in defense of Andrew Jackson Bradley birds or stick around [noise]\n\nUsed our intelligence service the door\n[noise] those hot pepper sauce\nPresident Trump says Saudi Arabia is an ... suspects are in custody and the death of journalist ...\n... is a good first step the president comments came after Saudi Arabia climbed up the Washington Post contributor was killed or the ...\nCampaign stops it on Twitter President Trump is easing of the care of out of Central American migrants tried to reach the U.

Jackson I Do and that's why I have on Hillsdale professor Bradley Byrne or who's written a book called in defense of Andrew Jackson I we were talking about Indian removal or you know that seems like one of those terms that what what the heck does it mean what does that mean exactly in his era I he was dispatched\nBy what the US government to do this who told him to do or what he did with regard to the Native Americans\nActually Eric he's the one giving the orders here so it's when president that he gets through Congress so that very first year and he's president gets through Congress a bill called the Indian removal act this would have been Eighteen thirty\nAnd the goal was to take the tribes mostly in the south but there were a number of northern strides even in Michigan right here with a pot of water meter Hillsdale there were a number of tribes that were to be removed and they were given land than older and tried to give it landed Kansas\nAnd the southern trends were given land in Oklahoma\nSo if there was an attempt in a successful attempt at least from the terms of the government terrible if you're an Indian but there was this move up those Indians and ultimately ends up under Martin Van Buren we have uh what was called the trail of tears when the Cherokees were removed\nAnd there was a lot of bloodshed involved not because there was open warfare but global itself was so brutal that a number of people died in roots\nBack a huge number of people died and outrageous number so the removal itself was a disaster but they were sent the Indians were set out white you on the kind of id Meridian\nWhich was called me permitted Indian frontier basically on the great plains which is where they were put in Oklahoma and Kansas\nAnd so ah he's\nReal violent for that because he he didn't just executed but he was the one that was pushing for it\n... it was one of his main the main things that he ran on the president's see an Eighteen twenty eight and I think for a lot of people so they were asking why did you become this kind of\nA controversial figure in the Nineteen sixties there was a a real move by the new left and it wasn't always wrong I think a lot of things they were doing and I agree with their politics but I think some of their\nThe ideas that they have we're not necessarily law the new left was trying to reexamine so much of what had happened in American history and it kind of latched on to Andrew Jackson as the ultimate kind of capital was imperial is\nAbout as they would have put it right a pig or a dog yeah um and they really tried to waste upon him a huge burden that is he becomes to represent everything we did wrong at the ... century\nWell I gave that to ... silhouette I'm Sorry when no since the book's title in defense of Andrew Jackson let me ask you let's try to get inside his head or inside the heads of Shirley Lou voted for him knowing that this was the policy for which he was advocating what what was the issue because I'm not aware\nOf a ... why somebody would think the Native Americans of that era in place why they would have to be moved to another was why couldn't we coexist with them what was the issue at that time so\nYeah so he's elected in Eighteen twenty eight so it takes office in twenty nine and he's been there for to church so it done and thirty seven so twenty to thirty seven\nAnd he ... he really is it is interesting\n'cause he was even early on I mean I Know I Can't remember where I ... I read it but that but even as a as a boy a he had controversy you were saying that he served\nAs a twelve year old and a Thirteen year old in in the revolutionary war which is hard to imagine that a boy right today we don't we just can't imagine such a thing\nAnd that that he was captured by the British as as a as a boy that's right ah and and there's this controversial thing that that he was commanded by a British uh a colonel I guess to\nClean the British officers boots and he refused I mean it's an amazing thing any young boy that's right would refuse to do something he's a prisoner of war he's a boy what does he Thirteen Years old\nThe ... uh he refuses and the officer slashed at him with a sword\nUh enjoy our scarring him on his head and his hand for life and you think what kind of a human being\nOr would you become if you experience that as a boy I mean that kind of brutality and then obviously a and the death of his brother and you know it's just another universe this as an excuse or some sure what he did but\nHe is important for us to understand uh you know what life was like a in those days for some people not for all people but certainly for him\nAnd Eric you know I think it's important to note too that he really does come out of that very brutal scotch Irish culture so it's not just that he's on the frontier but his mother who was going to Beijing woman and she died\nCatching a disease helping American sailors and soldiers during the revolution that she gave her life essentially as a nurse but she taught him from day one as low scotch Irish children were taught\nThat violence is the way men solved things and that that was ingrained in Jackson as what so many people have a tendency in Kentucky frontiers a it was just very much a part of it\nWell is this extraordinary I mean I Know that he he lost his mother when he was fourteen a boy and his his brothers and that he blamed the British for that and that's just one of those you know the whole life it shaped like ...\n... yeah it it was a guy who held a grudge and we're we're right\nAh it it it shapes you a forever\nUm I I Know that we have a photograph of him when he was very very old uh I think it's from Eighteen forty five which is amazing to me to photograph light people you know born uh who who actually served in the revolutionary war doesn't seem possible but so he does kind of spam or\nAre these periods and it's interesting just to think of somebody who would have been involved in the revolution a who who then lives as long as he does it really comes into another era that Iran right before the civil war of course\nI knew what a symbol to and you're absolutely right of course he would've had to been super young in the revolution for that to happen but I agree with you here's this guy who is remaining all the way until Eighteen forty five that carry that legacy\nAnd that memory solve one that other generations really watch the other thing if you don't mind I'll just do this in at this point that I Love about this generation to do what they were talking about adversity John Quincy Adams\nI feel very sorry for them in a lot of ways I we we were there the founders\nFounders were their fathers and you can imagine how can John Quincy Adams ever live up to what his dad did write a letter to agree to a guy he was never be John Adams and I think that whole generation clay Webster Calhoun they are desperately trying to prove that they are worthy Saturday\nAnd I think it needs a string and a lot of ways but it also I think it energizes them to do crazy things too\nWell it is interesting I I Know also that he adopted a Native American that's bizarre to me when you think about how he's perceived as somebody who hated or the Indians or who was you know or what his policies were catastrophic to Native Americans but that he himself adopted a boy who was a Native American\nYou know his prejudices were funny a funny strange so yes there were certain Indians he just like certain why she does like ... Black Sea dislike but in general is rule was you never committed an act of violence towards anyone who has a volunteer to be in front of you\nSo if a man wants to do all you that's fine if an Indian by chew that's fine but you never attack women or choking ever under any circumstances and he lives by that rule so he could he was very violent it was very brutal but there were restrictions is only got\n... did it right that we're going to come back from sucking Bradley bart's or a a a a a professor at Hillsdale College the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson we'll be right back [noise]\nNine Ninety intelligence conservative talk how well\n[noise]\nI don't see how my life can get any better [noise]\nEverything it just feels like everything around me is falling apart if something doesn't change soon I just don't know what else I can do\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] to counseling is here to help our team of license Christian counselor I Want to help\nYou get to read this we can begin a conversation when you're ready now I texture phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home I'd like to give you your first we free\nTo try faithful counseling dot com let's talk go right now to try faithful counseling dot com we really want to help you I mean it's so easy to get started and your first week is marine go now to try faithful counseling dot com let us help\n[noise] [noise]\nDid you know the average person spends about one third of their life sleeping Hi I'm Gary Volvo being a prize is complete\nInvasions and here's how we can help you sleep better\nBetter knowing your roof starting were windows were installed by both be certified groups see better knowing vote begin provide flexible payment planes to make your project affordable sleep better knowing that since Nineteen Seventy loyalties are professionals people depend on sleep better knowing boldly provides a lifetime guarantee on our ...\nCustomers will comfort me sleep much better knowing that they'll be in a process has been covered so don't be cranky from lack of sleep now were amazing ... waiting for months on June ... percent music goes over the dot com for details or\nIn law were quarter ten times joining it goes from one hundred pennies\nHowever you added up a dollar doesn't get you much anymore and gone are the days of picking up an ice cream cone a bag of chips for lunch or even a bottle of water or on your body thankfully\nStand up to cancer can make a dollar count joined us by getting a dollar or more when you check out online or in the door at any PBS pharmacy location\nWe weren't held all buns raid that killed her twenty eight for November Seventeen will support them definitely can't they're headed lifesaving research then that the cancer is committed to funding science to get better treatment to patient\nFaster than ever before for more information that W.

tempting for most people typically people more on the left\nTo demonize people in the past and they compared them to uh where we are today in our standards and that's mostly unfair and it's not just unfair is actually silly because I'm a ... you can't get anywhere thinking that way you really have to try to see people\nGetting their contacts that doesn't mean you excuse things but at least you have a more nuanced view of of who they were Jackson really is um he is complicated I mean it's it's amazing to me and it's maybe one of the reasons why he's a figure worthy of study\nEric things for
