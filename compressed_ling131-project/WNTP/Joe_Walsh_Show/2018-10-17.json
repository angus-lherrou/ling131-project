stopped you when you started doing comedy you were not interested in watching comedy\nSo we're like I just didn't have the I just it was hard for me to they had the clubs and continue to wash couldn't get it like who told you you had to anyway would have to move like if you're at a comedy club you go on stage you need to kind of rubbing elbows\nWith the other guys who're they're going to make you funnier are just getting more connection well it'll get you potentially more stage time because a lot of the comedians will have their own shows that they do drugs is a city I got you okay so I so for professional reasons for networking river yeah for for that and just for learning\nAnd I know I didn't understand why I didn't have a taste for it but then after after some years went by and I really got my own voice and clearly know who I Am income and I\nSuddenly I wanted to watch comedy and I realized it was going on is I Would have been influenced correct by those others and that's right but not even known and even some of my friends some of that you wouldn't know when I watched her comedy I can see who they watched when they were ... when they were\nGoing on you could have ended up being like the black Sam kennison and yeah and nobody wants to see that and\nYeah you know what I mean or a ... I could have been smashing like fruit and stuff [noise] I don't see that happening already ... or ... yeah oh no\n... yeah\nUm now let me ask you something uh\nI'm gonna ask you the question asked you for because you didn't answer it when you were a kid growing up and you're watching people on TV or whatever who did you connect with and say I think he's funny I Want to be like that\nYeah when I was a kid I wasn't thinking more comedy is that right so you didn't watch I don't know J. J. Walker you didn't watch a while and it had come in who you know I don't have on TV and find them funny\nAll my channels have have led shows on as I Would just have written\nWell I just assumed that because you're black comedian you might have had some you know lack of median for very long only well oh usually you're going to tell me oh Bob Newhart was my biggest influence no maybe I don't know\n... nobody to analyze the dog you're very serene will result I'm trying to ask knew who were your like Steven Wright has that cerebral ruined why no he is in\nBerlin and you're a little bit like that\nYeah your hair is different but you're a little bit like that ... it's because we're so close really not interesting but but ... you um so you don't have anybody like that that you would say like that wanted out do\nYou love to watch right now who's still go to me uh Brian Regan disturb yes he is um ... Jim go up against her therapy and\nGap again is also clean he's a Christian I Know Jim ... but I I'm ... years old and she's also clean she's\nYeah she's as funny as early Mac was brilliant too but but come on when you were a kid you didn't like you don't say like yeah\nBecause of my company my company actually comes from a when I was a kid I used to struggle more reading\nLike I ... up in a quiz is really bad start to look at words differently but I'm Talking about even in middle school\nI'd I'd have to look at the ... and the color of the positioning what's in front of what's behind it how people responded to it actually came up with seven different ways to look at a word to determine what the where it was no joke for real but I got really good at it to the point in high school people didn't know it wasn't really reading I was just working out really really fast and I was going to do are we just fine\nBut I still got disability look at words and people in situations seven different ways almost immediately and that's the primary play supplement company for ...\nYou know where you are right if you're a genius you I'm not kidding you're genius you have a you have an ability to see I remember when I heard you do comedy at one point you went into this in depth he told a story and I realized that that's just a freaky gift likely to have\nIt is but I mean it could be a curse but it's a gift in your case rising it ... I mean right like that sometimes people they don't ask to see things the way they see that but just to kind of a gift but you're able to turn it into ...\nFirst person to call me a genius to really kind of touched me a little through promise you I'll be the last so because people need to be geniuses themselves to recognize ... application for working directly [laughter]\nIf I had far no probably are but I mean I\nI I Try not to use words like that lately I I think it's true that you have you have a a you have\nOutrageous gift and that's what enables you to be funny even though when you talk about humor you're thinking about it is looking at it from the ... you know like me is that you can instinctive thing mhm and they they have never thought about it they just know how to do it what it is to\nThere's two things I've learned that really so whenever you someone laugh to retain more information or they just they just simply do retain like at least I think it's thirty percent more information that's why the super bowl commercials are so funny they always make them funny because he wants to remember their product well\nThat's what I Do comedy if I'm if people if their hearts are open\nI like to make a deposit so even for example in the movie a morning funny we were making a deposit was strategically making a deposit into people\nEven though it's Ninety seven percent funny but people will be mood or as a as a result of this like there's eight year olds who come to my shows who are laughing and then even crying as a result of some of the stuff that we share in between\nThe journey that drinking a drug in and they yeah go into comedy they do even the eight year olds ... year we're reaching a you know say hey you need to get your\nLife together so you do not so ... I I'm just fascinated that I Want to ask you like a simple question like that you would ask any comedian like ... going up you you're kind of telling me you didn't have any\nYou know I respect a bunch of comedians and really enjoy watching them now but now I think about where their work in fluids meaning influenced my style like it was they had a\nThey cause me to change my ... and they didn't really happen I just had my own I just stayed away from it but I didn't want to I just literally couldn't I just didn't have the desire it was weird but now looking back at in retrospect I'm really happy because\nThe way I'm doing comedy hasn't been done before not the comedy itself with the\nBut the extra stuff that we're doing in between the jokes\nRight well you are you also realize that influences if they're if they're good they help you find your own voice as opposed to kind of overwhelm you you know what I mean like say you you you kind of\nThey they help you may know what's possible in terms of comedy I like that and I have that in writing a little bit but if it's a it's a fine line because you do feel like some people just re treads or something else here but who knows maybe that is their voice and a religious responded to somebody else or to\nThe line of people say all the time and I really liked blind we're to talk about uh you're only going to be successful is your five\nClosest friends were right so if that's the case with ... with friends who's ... who's a five people like who else who who you're listening to because we have our gates irrigate everything's on come in and then it's going to show up so I'm your wages\nRebuild you'll never succeed in comedy I'm just telling you right now [laughter] because I don't do this army under the influence right so what you're saying that's what I'm trying to ... it is so no no no I Am really fascinated because I remember when I heard you do comedy a number of years ago I remember thinking\nYou're somebody who think very differently looking at things from different angles and that's really what makes you not only who you are but it makes it it it gives you your comedy some

you're not interested in in that you don't have a federal movie coming out you know is that right there's a movie\nOctober Eighteen one night only on moving or been funny with\nSound to more than funny that it does seem to me though are\nThis movie obviously it's funny but you are you're asking people to think about their lives and what their purpose in life\nBut not just a here's what are the image before at the end of the movie is a ridiculous unexpected call to action for people who make to make a decision to be a punch line or a punch line is a person who's looking for an opportunity to give but you can't give 'em money\nBecause money is not a punch line it's only the result of using your set up a case of this as diverse or I saw surprise set this up again I how you can\nI'm merely a vessel that as as a doctor title set a pastor and an instrument of God's Grace you know it's it's um\nI don't know because I I I wrote the first Christian book and I go man there's so many people born dollars rolling and better at this than I Am and yet it came together in a way that I think was accessible to people that my buddies couldn't my buddy the illusion or passers could probably not a very it's a lot of them they couldn't\nAnd then I I got the courage to do the next one about the Old Testament the pointing to Christ and I did the gospels and I don't know I really don't know every time I finish a book I got an right that somebody else wrote that I couldn't do that and the same thing with this one I go\nAnd before I START I can't do this I got a call ... I I I signed a contract but I'm just kidding and but then I get into and I study immerse myself in in ... yes I can do this again and now I'm doing now twenty four seven violating the Sabbath four months to a to derive these things [noise]\nI don't know I just feel like there's there's something or to studying this and sharing it in a way of people that are on the level that I was I have an enthusiasm that I Want to impart to them and I think I can help set some people on fire and I've I've gotten great feedback on that\nI'm from a lot of readers and I don't know I don't it just kind of my niche I Do think it's pretty bizarre that I'm doing this without having any formal\nTraining although it's not bizarre listening you know I'm teasing you I I did the same thing okay and of course\nYou know we'd be a arrogance fools not to have a moment of doubt and humility into say indeed who am I to tell the story about the same time a scripture is full of stories where God just tells people to do stuff and they say oh I Can't do it in my end of the fact of the matter is if God has called you to do something\nYou do it in obedience and you trust him with the results in the ... the matter is that\nYou you uh have a gift of communication I find interesting your your brother\nIs it rush rush rush also as a gift of communication and when you have a gift of communication which I I Am by God's Grace also have you want to use it\nTo help people and sometimes you can write a book on a on a subject people write books on subjects just like this book\nAnd it doesn't sing it doesn't speak it it's sort of the kind of thing that it's a it's an effort to get through it and uh your books are not that way and and I really am glad that you've taken the time to write them because we all need someone to hold her hand to walk us through the scriptures that's what this is\n... thank you and you know when I was in this position maybe I should this for I don't think I did but um\nI I feel like I'm I Wish I had someone when I was first hungry and learning I Wish there was a short cut I Want to consume I Want to inhale the Bible and the theological knowledge\nAnd and I don't know how to do and I just groped around I kept finding I kind of did it the hard way get studying things and I think I have I Do think I have a gift to discern where I can kind of tell what's out there and what's mainstream what's reliable so I've been I think I've been blessed with that\nAnd so and I am telling that not regular 'cause I Want to convince readers that I'm not one of those\nPeople that are out there you can trust this step it's mainstream theology and biblical thinking\nAnd I just feel like I was in that position where I wanted to learn\nSo these books that I write or what I Wish I Would have had access to myself somebody a written I'm sure there are books like that that I didn't see that these are my version of what I Wish I had had a Twenty years ago when I was starting 'cause it would really accelerated my learning curve\nIt it's so funny to hear you say this because I Swear I'm not making this up I wrote a three books of apologetic ... ah everything always wanted to know about ... afraid to ask everything else he was on top I got ... got to ask and then the last one is diseases edition everything about God and I\nI wrote them exactly for the same same reason I said to myself when I was in my twenties or whatever [noise]\nDidn't I never heard any of this stuff I just went blind and and when I finally became a Christian you know I found some great books but I think a lot of times people write books because they wish they had had such a thing when they were younger and that is why I wrote my apologetic books a wide swath still write what I write but\nThen you realize that there's a need for something or for people who are hungry and the fact is that\nThere there may be a lot of books but a lot of them are not\nAccessible a lot of them are written for the layman you know uh and so I ... that that's why I'm so grateful you've taken the trouble to go through scripture like this verse by virtue now for somebody knows nothing about Paul in the early church people listening right now they're they're anything about it\nPaul in the early church what are we talking about what year what's going on now give us the broad picture\nWhat well a Christ split history in half\nThe way another convincing proof of his existence uh they they ... they reorient the time so Christ was born what six be said to be ... zero BC whatever and Paul was pretty much the same age and uh after Christ was crucified and resurrected but an ascended\nPaul was around ... as a an ardent Jew and a follower of the law and a student of of Judaism and he was a persecuted of the church and so he's in his mid thirties probably early thirties\nAnd um he's going around outraged that Jews are accepting Christ is the messiah when he knows he knows that can't be true\nBut I remember when I learned this I I remember I learned that the summer I came to faith now I've been an altar boy in church every week and it just shows you going to church you may learn nothing because what for whatever reason but I remember when I learned\nThat the apostle Paul St Paul\nBefore he became the great leader of the Christian faith that we know he was persecuting Christians I ... when I learned that I thought\nYou want to talk about conversion holy cow this was one of the smartest people of his day he was a genius in terms of the scriptures he said he's under the mail yet the biggest venture of the time so he was\nPaul was an absolute genius one of the smartest most effective uh you know a a Bible people of his day Old Testament people of his day and he was using his faith in his knowledge to persecute\nChristians so one day he has this thing happened to him and will you you tell the story I mean this is like unbelievable except we know what actually happened\nHe ... and let me this as a backdrop that let me tell you why\nHe believes that Judaism is authentically from God that that that Jews are God's chosen people by the way you and I believe that as well by the way genes us believe that any who's a Jew and and and all that was true everything you learned was true\nBut then the Christians come along Christ comes along it can't be the messiah because he was dies on a tree he's hung on a tree which Old Testament scripture says you're cursed if you do\nHe was also supposed to deliver them aside as it's supposed to deliver a military and political victory Christ went down in defeat and humiliation uh apparently\nAnd he he couldn't possibly be what they were looking for so no this couldn't have happened So Paul\nDoesn't just think the Christians are not a threat they're\nStarting a a religion even a competing religion that would have been okay no they're twisting his religion and the word of God that's a serious affront in his defense I don't blame him for being outraged because that's what he was taught to believe\nSo he's on a mission to imprison kill 'em persecute them he's on his way to Damascus he ask for permission from the religious ... religious authorities in Jerusalem to arrest these heretic than Damascus and on his way there he's blinded with a\n... am Suzanne we're going to come right back folks we can tell you the rest of the

out there listening who doesn't know when Christmas talk about the book of Romans or the ... whatever what do we mean by that what we mean is that this man Paul uh is traveling around the ancient world\nChurches creating Jesus a bull believer groups here and here and here and here but then it keeps traveling and the only way you can communicate with them is to write these letters so he hears things from them they write letters to him\nAnd the letters that he wrote to them we can just imagine what's going through his mind he's not just like let me just down if you know these thinking this is this may be the only thing I get to say to this group of people so he takes tremendous pains\nTo school them in doctrine what's right what's wrong so there's all kinds of the logical stuff in there and then as you just had this practical stuff 'cause he hears about arguments about communion or this or that\nAnd he puts it all down not knowing that this would become a part of the Bible it's a it's kind of an amazing\nThing it's an amazing thing in another parallel thing it's grounded in actual\nHistory just like the entirety of Christianity is grounded in the history of Jesus as badly resurrection so here's Paul not writing some abstract theological doctrine\nThat's untethered to real historical events he's living this experience and under the Holy Spirit but empowerment he's writing these letters to the church that are that are steeped in practical advice in doctrine not knowing that they're only going to be available to us pray in a transcendent way\nHow cool is that I was going to really that's what so cool is that when you say in a transcending way when he was writing them\nAs you're saying he didn't understand that they would become scripture for everybody that I'm just I'm just writing to the specific group of people either in Rome or in colossus or in a ... show or one of these places he's writing to them but the way he wrote\nGod used it to reach

why did I said I don't know I just wanted Santa\nNo no no no no I liked I liked that I mean I think it's important to talk about there are people who everybody's different but there's some people usually are Christians they get very fussy about like they they don't like anything for example I missed the call right up there like wow\nI missed the call I just want the word of God we're gonna what are you what do you think the word of God is yeah God\nIt has created a door to heaven through these words on the page is is that mystical conversion mystical mar angels mystical\n... the point is we are living in a reality there's the physical reality and then there is according to the word of God according to the Bible there's this mystical reality all around us here and I'm always amazed at how Christians can be the most guilty of getting nervous by that you know a ...\nYou know as though the spiritual world can only be a counterfeit of God and you think well wait a second you can go wrong in both directions some people think that everything spiritual must be good no there's a demonic ... realm and you should be really scared on the other hand\nThere is an angelic realm and God and the Holy Spirit want to speak to us miss the lead people don't like that word pick whatever word you want in a transcendental way a in a transcending way but I think that it is important for us to to understand that that Paul himself rights when he's in prison he's in prison and he says\nI Am seeded with you and heavily places so in other words\nPhysically we're here but if we have been born again by the spirit of God we're always in two places at once yes I'm physically here but by faith because I had been born again spiritually I Am with the lord and it's an amazing thing to try to comprehend that\nYeah he probably are not supposed to be proud of these things but I I Am I I feel really good about that that I I've gotten the feedback from a lot of people that they these books do help people understand scripture better and make them want to get into scripture better and and as you say that they do they will survive\nA to some extent I don't have any idea and and again I don't take personal credit for whatever it is and this is a false humility we all know that Christians that this is has to be from the Holy Spirit if it has any lasting\nValue that's a positive value then yeah I'm humbled by it I I Love it it's just an exciting thing is exciting period in my personal or professional development that's more gratifying than anything I've ever done\nAnd what happens after this book did you say you're going to go into the other episodes in in the scripture\nYes I Would have finished the all the New Testament after the gospels with this book but space limitations\nWhich must be a demonic thing yeah that's it I just I went to the content speak for itself it dictates the amount of space I'm going to cover I don't try to artificially reduce it trying to make it accessible but deep enough\nTo to impart what I Want and it just lend itself to these six books\nA pause missionary pistols the once he wrote on his three missionary journey and on his trip to Rome now he's got seven I've got seven if this was left to cover on excited to cover those and the rest of the episodes that the other apostles wrote I don't think I'm going to have the audacity to tackle the book of revelation well maybe we can do that together\n'cause we're we're we gotta we could not that on the weekend no seriously that's a that's pretty big but well I mean part of the reason that you didn't want to do it all in one book is because once it goes beyond three hundred pages people get weird yeah and I think that ... probably smartly said hey\nAh please keep it to to the kind of a size of a book where people actually pick it up and buy it and read it and stuff and\nAnd again you're very accessible and so sometimes I think are book full of people into thinking it's going to be very\nUs scope scholarly a times my bigger books have done that people kind of scared and stuff and the fact that matters no that's uh that's just the parents but um I I just think the idea that you're basically entertaining scripture I've thought of doing the same thing I haven't done it but the reason is that when you get into\nThe Bible and and stuff pops out at you you get so excited you want to tell your friends right yes you find things and he's come this is great yeah I Want to tell the whole world and I want to so I'm I'm kinda glad that you're so\nExcited yeah I used to do that in Sunday school but you only read about twenty people and uh and plus they know you and I know you're not profound so they don't listen anyway so you you taught Sunday school yes the ... at your church yeah sporadically like once every two years I'd do it\nThree or two months class or three months plant right yeah well that's interesting does Jimmy Carter still teach Sunday school\nSecond

of the afterlife\nNot what most of my friends were thinking about on the other hand I Do want you to know folks I went to hockey games every week just I I did leave a normal life semi normal\nAnyways the ultimate issues our I'm Dennis Prager and I have a truly a terrific guests man I have tremendous respect for Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture at the discovery Institute in Seattle\nOr I Would you tell people I think it's important given that we're going to talk about science and face so 'til people don't be humble about some of your credentials in the in that arena\nSure um I as you mentioned direct is a network of scientists or run out of the discovery Institute in Seattle [noise] um my PHD is in the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge in England prior to that I worked as a geophysicist and a\nBit of a double a physics geology or science degree and as an undergraduate and um [noise]\nA written a couple a couple of books um one signature on the cell and the question of the origin of the first life in the second one called Darwin's doubt\nA which is a question of about the origin of the first animals which uh prepare very abruptly in the fossil record in Contra diction to Darwin's own expectations of a very gradual origin for for animal life\nSo your life has been immersed in science by the way just I've never asked you this and all over time both privately and a um a radio in public what does the philosophy of science me it's the\nIt's the discipline that addresses scientific questions that are right at the margin of science and philosophy things about\nThe nature and a basis of human knowledge that what's called in philosophy pissed some algae how we know what we know but also questions about a new consciousness the origin of university origin of life\nUm and these are the ... the the topics that have always really fascinated me how did we get here how did life get here\nUm there's a huge scientific dimension to these questions but they also have encouraged to believe philosophical implications and so\nI've always been attracted right at that boundary between the two and you have to learn a lot of science to be any good in it and you have to be thinking philosophically to make any sense of it Craig combination did you enjoy your time ...\nReally now if you have to do if you have to do something as grueling as a PHD it's nice to do it in some place like Cambridge or Oxford with a lot of cultural compensations and wonderful people have the weather helps the weather's awful but I'm going to Seattle so I was\nAlready knocking late at night I never thought about\nHis latest book which he edited is a collection of essays\nAnd don't let the title but in any way that you use the evolution a scientific philosophical of be a logical critique number words they use the revolution is\nThe attempt of many and very good will people to reconcile God and evolution and this is a series of essays critic critique critical of that position right up that position\nSo let me get to that in the book is up a dentist Prager dot com and obviously I mean if you interested in theology or science will find this immensely interesting\nSo I mentioned to your right before we went on the air that I until really I met you to be honest\nUh my my view was I didn't really care about evolution is that it didn't bother me if it was true and it didn't bother me if it wasn't true I Believe in God as the creator of happens in the earth the God of genesis one\nAnd if if God used evolution water why care it's all a miracle anyway so back in ... in a nutshell than I I read to you and talk to you\nAnd my wife frankly whose loans or a fair amount of as you know about evolution and and uh it has become less and less tenable\nNot for religious reasons but for scientific reasons\nTo\nUh to endorse the evolution as it is generally talk so before we get to garden evolution\nI Know this is ridiculous in the time that I Will give me give you a couple of minutes can summarize\nEvolution and why it's you know I Wish I'd be skeptical about well not not only we yeah they are but but scientists right this is what you are but in my mind to scientists are having trouble with that but right right okay go ahead so\nQuick three definitions of the term evolution for orientation the first is simply change over time nobody nobody challenges that there has been change over time or the kind of small scale variation we see in Galapagos finch beaks are peppered malls or a bacteria that acquire ... antibiotic resistance is sometimes called micro evolution\nUm second definition of evolution is the idea of universal common descent and the idea that all organisms are connected by common ancestry back to one or very few simple forms such that the best picture of the history of life is like a giant branching tree as part of Darwin's argument the origin\nAnd asserted most controversial meaning of evolution is the idea that there's an ... guided directed mechanism namely natural selection acting on random mutations that can produce all the new forms of life that emerged in the history of life the producers all the change over time\nAnd that that mechanism um it is also responsible for the appearance of design that that ... biological systems manifested even leading evolutionary biologist acknowledge\nSo those are three key definitions the first is innocuous nobody doubts that the second is somewhat controversial the third is where do you ... on the tree I'm I'm skeptical about the the universal common descent there's a lot of continuity in the fossil record and in the ... uh patterns that we're now observing\nA but the key issue and the one that leading evolutionary biologist themselves are now questioning the idea that the mutation selection mechanism as genuine creative power the ability to generate fundamentally new forms of life ah so what you hear a lot of evolutionary biologist quoting now an aphorism is that\nA media mutation selection explains the survival but not the arrival of the fittest explains a small scale variations but nothing major innovations and in virtue of that uh two years ago this time um I was at a conference at the of the royal society in Britain the oldest ah\nIn arguably most August scientific body in the world they called a conference to a assess modern neo Darwinism and specifically to call for\nA new theory of evolution many of the evolutionary biologist there were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation and selection as creative power the opening talk of the conference by ... leading Austrian evolutionary biologist\nAnd numerous rated uh several key what he called explanatory deficits of the modern version of Darwin's theory new Darwinism are a number of the the the deficits that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis bombing\nThe royal society want us to forming\nThe royal society of London it was started by Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first president was yeah yeah just reading about them yesterday okay\nSo they that's incredible that you had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation whip\nWhere most if not all of the talks were were exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement compliment replace the standard mutation selection mechanism the odd thing about the conference however was that\nUh there was a group of of ah when they called themselves third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nA day I reject standard near Darwinism so they're looking for another approach they have a a ... of one group of scientists is known as the uh Alton Berg sixteen and one of the scientists who was involved in that who have called the conference declared at the end of this world society conference\nThat it was interesting but it was characterized by a lack of momentous nests\nIn other words they did a good job of critiquing the neo Darwinian mechanism but nothing really was offered to solve this problem because they rejected rejected out out of hand intelligent any kind and guidance any any any right mind or purpose in in in the process by for rises so where\nThose flaws might be and then the issue of reconciling if possible God and this evolution my guest Dr Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture the discovery Institute in Seattle now edited used the evolution\nA an agent of destruction or it can and introduced very minor preserve a bull changes that might be slightly tweak her optimize\n... when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years who have believed what you now say is not\nTenable what does that say if you are right what does that say about scientists\nScience like uh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to group think\nOr to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments in particular in the debate about biological origin there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle known as methodological\nNatural awesome and it says it if you're going to be a true scientist you have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanations for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates which will be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle Ben precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered at the foundation of life we've discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates the our local hero in a in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program will be much more complex than we've ever device but where does software come from it comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligence um\nActivity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that um are a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information\nAnd know persuasive Darwinian explanation has been offered for any of this type of complexity the integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe ... ... all some aberration was born and prosper because it was better than the previous ... a ...\nA a a plausible theory in the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level [noise]\nUh in the wake of that theory of a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then as the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that would in any other realm of experience point to a designing intelligence that the principal of methodological
