for defending religious freedom for Americans all over this country alliance defending freedom won a seven to decision from the Supreme Court this\nJune defending Colorado Baker jak Philips from actions by the Colorado government that infringed on his deeply held religious beliefs but despite that ruling the Colorado agency has once more targeted jak Philips\nA as a D E F lawyer or John Bruce ... tells us\nHe's back in ... all over again and then sell ADS on behalf of Mr Philips has not only helping him defend that action but as also filed affirmatively inaction in Colorado federal court saying that these violations of his religious free exercise rights need to be stopped right at the courthouse state so that he doesn't continue to be persecuted\nHey alliance defending freedom is second to none in defending religious liberty including arguing in winning cases before the Supreme Court but providing free legal support to people whose religious beliefs are under attack\nYeah absolutely so posture Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as girls are allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very\nBad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show but we've been talking about what the dangers of adopting these policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluid I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the ... elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah it does school district\nPolicy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness oh about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect the desires of the child in the end\nArea rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom does a young boy that identifies as ginger fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade as Pashtuns daughter and so given a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but what the the bigger problem is the school and a blend assemble\nWho buddies released in ... who identified him as gender fluid that just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but under the school policies in indicators unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today the schools essentially say okay\nWe're not going to question that we're not going to determine whether that there's a better accommodations we can ... that we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nRestroom or facility you want to regardless of the impact it has on other students\nWell it it's just a stunning thing that it's possible\nFor a little girl I'm to be exposed to anything of any kind of a sexual nature when she just wants to go to the bathroom I mean the fact that because we all know that there are very troubled kids out there we don't know or anything it seems about this boy but the very idea that it's described as something\nOf a sexual nature at this age it's just horrifying but you're telling me that the school\nHad this policy so they could not stop this boy from going into the girl's bathroom\nNot only that but after all of this you would think the school might reconsider\nIts policy it hasn't done so you would think the school might even just say look maybe we ought to make sure posh his daughter and this boy you're no longer in the same classroom that didn't happen as well it left Pasha with the only option of taking her daughter out of that school something any parent would do when the school was so unresponsive to what happened here\nAnd that just shows that this is this is not about you know trying to keep the students interest first what it's about the school\nStanding by as a very dangerous unsafe policy even in light of evidence of harm it resulted in to pass his daughter\nWell I I think what you see happening over and over men\nIs that people have no courage when it comes to these kinds of cultural issues in other words everybody knows right now the easy thing to do\nIs to go along with this sort of you know transgender trend and if you bucket people are going to say what are you are you a big it and so typically people in authority school authorities people in corporations\nThey have very little courage in other words they just want to do whatever they need to do to not get in trouble and in this case who's going to suffer the kids so so they're not doing their job and they're forcing this mother to take her little girl out of the school because they refused to do their job I mean that strikes me as a what is happening here\nYeah that's exactly right you know the school has a lot of options that it could have offered to this young boy a dove\nGiving him a single use the restroom that he has access to but what it should never do is adopt a broad sweeping policy that says use whatever restroom you want to go in there with little girls are in there and that is the danger of these policies is rather than taking a stand and say no we're not going to compromise the privacy and safety of our other students were going to find solutions but\nWe're not going to do it at the expense of everyone else they took the roof to say no let's just adopt this broad sweeping policy let's not\nHave the courage to take a stand and say is is really best for all of our students\nAnd we're not going to do anything to compromise the safety of pastas daughter and others like her\nI I didn't think when I when I grew up a there we would be in a world that is in some ways a crazy that this is craziness when you when you cannot uh have a common sense to say that a five year old\nShould not be given the option to identify as anything other than what he is which is a little boy the idea that this kid is gender food I mean the question is did a doctor say that he needs to be a treated this way did his parents say it we don't really have those facts but the idea that\nThese schools are so afraid of doing something wrong that they are allowing this to go on it really is a kind of madness I think we have to call it\nWhat it is it's a kind of madness a but it has to do with religious liberty in this case because ah as ... defending freedom has\nSaid over and over and over uh the people who believe that to men or men and women are women were were were being treated like where this crazy minority when most Americans understand these ideas about these transgender trends have just been pushed on us and here you have a case where\nA this woman passionate Thomas ah is is not being treated right now what what what are you in what is the ATF looking for in this case because you said that this woman I'm a I mean who who is suing whom and what are the details of that suit\nAs things stand right now we we had worked with posture to file a complaint with the federal government with the department of education office of civil rights\nAnd we were encouraged to see that the federal government is taking a look at this and launching an investigation into the school district because their concern is not only is you know this is a dangerous policy but they the school district may have violated federal law\nBy adopting this policy not responding appropriately to to what happened in creating a hostile environment for policy has a daughter and and other young girls at this school so that's a bright light and all of this is that we now have a federal government that's taking these issues seriously and so we're going to continue to work throughout that investigatory process\nUh but at the end of the day what were warning is a good policy in place when that ensures something like this doesn't happen when that ensures that girl showers locker rooms and restaurants are reserved for girls ... and the young men and boys don't have access to them\nHang on one second folks are going to be right back oh we're talking with the alliance defending freedom is Matt Sharp on the ... show\n\nHey there it's Eric my taxes for policy genius here's an on fun fact over half of bankruptcy the mortgage foreclosures are caused by medical issues that's because if you get sick or injured over the course of your career your employer sick leave off in only covers you for up to three months\nAnd while health insurance helped with medical bills he doesn't replace lost income that is where disability insurance comes in is essentially income insurance to protect your paycheck if you're sidelined by an illness or injury\nPolicy genius as all the shopping for you they compare quotes from the top disability insurance companies to find the best price than their license experts managed the application process to said you timed and hassle\nPolicy genius has helped over four million people shop for insurance and placed over twenty billion dollars in coverage so if you rely on your income to get by compared disability insurance quotes with policy genius dot com\nWill help you protect your paycheck at a price that makes sense you can get started on line right now policy genius the easy way to compare and by disability insurance [noise]\nShocking to me that the government would try to take away my freedoms for some degree\nThat's jak Philips a masterpiece cake shopping Colorado who was sued for a living out his religious beliefs\nDefending freedom took his case all the way that the United States Supreme court which recently gave jak up big victory but apparently that when wasn't enough for the Colorado government because it is harassing him again yes you heard that right\nThis time we're taking the fight to the government you know we can't do this without your help right now your gifts of one hundred dollars will help jak an alliance defending freedom in this crucial fight against the hospital\nCalled eight hundred five five six seven seven zero eight hundred five five six to seven seven zero if it can happen to track it can happen to you or any of us that values religious freedom all eight hundred five five six to seven seven zero\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy\nThen you don't ... I Know that there are people out there thinking oh this is the year mongering uh\nI don't know what to say uh you know because the last thing I Would ever want to do is uh is you know play to people's emotions in that way but I think that this is it's such a serious issue and\nWe we all have and just think like well everything will be fine but everything won't be fined and everything is not find if it weren't for you\nAnd the folks alliance defending freedom doing the hard work of of taking these cases on for free and defending them these people would be hung out to dry Pasha Thomas you've just described I mean nobody is standing up for her and the whole school system is telling her hey you can go jumping a leg posture Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've seen this happen to a young five year old girl is a result of this this was avoidable had the school district\nRecognize the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board saying wait a second\nShould we be adopting this policy um but it's taken courageous ... people like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're going to take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just Pasha and her daughter not just even the kids indicator but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to say how I'm going to the restroom or it ought to be a place of safety especially for young women and the idea that somebody can go into a place like that an avid physically strong mail whether it's the same age or older uh\nBut but attack them or something like that that that shouldn't even be possible and of course here you know it it's the situation we don't know the details but uh it seems that it could be so much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about this general principle and you think about teenage kids and it it's just it's just a nightmare waiting to happen unless we have\nUnless reason prevails and unless a cool minds prevail in courts of law and we have

freedom to say they need your help right now you can go to my taxes talk dot com and you can give right there\nWhere there's a phone number I'm now ... you know I I just want to say that a few years ago I Would hear people bring up cases like this like the case of of jak Philips and I'm kind of roll my eyes and say you know those people always they're always complaining about these these are these kind of fringe these crazy stories and\nAnd the time has passed and I think to myself you know I I've met jak Philips I've met a who was it the the other the the the bakers of photographers who practically lost their business because all they did was say\nWhere Christians we cannot participate in a same sex a wedding ceremony goes against our values against their religion and those people are told hey shut up\nDo is you're told or we will sue your rear end you know all the way back to zero you will lose everything now\nWhen I when I really understand this I think this is the definition of an American in America you're supposed to have choices and right now people like that are being told you better do this or you lose everything now I Want to go back to Jack Philips a tell us the story about jak Philips and then I Want to talk about the new case the check Philips has\nSo jak Philips has a cake artist and does incredible designs on a variety of things but he's always operated consistent with certain views certain cakes he won't designed he won't use\nUtilize its artistic talent sworn to things like I'm celebrating Halloween that he doesn't like the you know devil imagery and all of that stuff or\nA cakes that are a denigrating the American flag or or mocking any group of people well he was approached by a couple that asked him to do a cake celebrating their same sex\nUnion and jak politely declined and said you know I I Can't use my artistic designed to to create a cake that celebrate something that I think\nViolates God's plans for marriage and as a result he was sued by this couple and the state of Colorado a and fought all the way to the Supreme Court losing it every step of the way and we were able to represent 'em free of charge and gets to the U.S Supreme Court and the Supreme Court says no Colorado you cannot have hostility towards jacks beliefs\nHe's entitled to those and you're a efforts to to denigrate those and punish them for those is unacceptable and so that's where it ended up that we thought was the end of the story I was the Jack was going to be indicated in his right to work and create art consistent with his beliefs\nRight so that that's step one right so um I've met Jack and you know he's he's like the definition of a normal guy he's got a business and you know that this ugly moment in history found him went looking for him and so suddenly becomes a plaintiff his name is all over the place and\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission\nThat had just lost at the Supreme Court\nUsed jacks case against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs\nThis isn't about letting him continue to operate as a business and serve every body but\nGive him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that um your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff that I'm telling you folks ah one we're fighting the civil war when we were finding the revolution there are always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is the battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid uh the people in the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up so the least we can do as I said his vote\nA please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't\nDon't do so many people have such excuses please if you don't vote don't ever complain again\nA and I want to say uh if you can give to the alliance defending freedom\nI don't know anybody that is doing this a kind of work right now so I Want to say go to my taxes ... dot com you'll see the banner every penny you give will be doubled up please give what you can\nVisit folks this is why God gives us money\nAnd energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it is tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way uh eventually\nThey're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values are you going to say uh where do I turn well uh I like to think you could turn to the audience defending freedom so the number in case you don't have a a website you can go to my taxes talk dot com if that's difficult or you can call one eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy a mat sharp uh what else are we looking at what other cases are out there right now because this seems to be a never ending\nIt's right I think one of the other big issues we've been working on dealing with a adoption and foster care providers\nSo we have a a crisis in our country with a four hundred thousand kids in the adoption foster care system about a hundred thousand kids\nAre eligible for adoption and we need organizations out there recruiting families trained them helping to connect kids with forever homes but the same uh effort to\nPunish faith based organizations just to the same hostility we saw towards the jak we're now seeing towards these agencies and so in Philadelphia in Massachusetts in Illinois and other places faith based agencies have been shut down run out of business simply because they want to operate\nConsistent with their view about the best environment to raise a kid that every child deserves a mother and father and so at the same time for example in Philadelphia that the city was saying we desperately need more foster care parents are just a few days later they were shutting down by Catholic social services because\nThey didn't like Catholic social services views about marriage and this again shows this ongoing hostility and the impact it's having on kids that they're being denied of organizations out there working to find them homes they're being denied of these families that\nWould have been recruited all because this effort to push an ideology and for the government to punish those that don't like that they don't like their beliefs\nI have to say if this doesn't make you mad folks if this doesn't make you mad I I just assume\nYou're not listening because this is horrendous and the only good news and that's why I'm here folks I'm not here to complain is to say you can do something about it one of the things you can do and I hope you will do is give to the alliance defending\nFreedom it doesn't matter what you give give something we've got to help them do what they do or you can go to the website ... attacks us talk dot com you can see the

this like ten years ago Fifteen Years ago chuckles we're talking about a nickel now you know there's these Christians always kind of talking about this and I've come to the conclusion unfortunately and I say unfortunately disturbing that they were right that if we do not fight for these things that we believe in\nA ... we're going to lose what we have the freedoms in America and okay so religious liberty you are right to believe what you believe and to act on it or to not do something because of your faith\nUm it it's under attack an ATF lines defending freedom they're standing up for it so um anyway let me just to be specific ah\nAmerica's a hundred and fourteen I think Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in\nUm ... last night uh okay uh and he's going to start work today which is kind of freaky right they're gonna they're going to work today and he's on the okay now alliance defending freedom this is the these are the folks that we're talking about and we just talked to um one of their lead guys Matt Sharp in our one\nAbout transgender and all this different stuff they won a seven to two decision from the Supreme Court just this past June okay defending the man that we were talking about in the last hour Colorado bigger jak Philips a firm actions by the Colorado civil rights commission and these people are on hinged\nLunatics I mean I have to say\nWhat they did it really it disturbing and the more you know about it the more I'm just telling you folks that you have to you have to fight because these people are hinged\nSo they so the Supreme Court ... gave us seven to decision thanks to alliance defending freedom this is my point lights winning freedom for free argued on behalf of jak\nPhilips is something that you even have to go to court it's insane but despite the ruling okay the same agency okay the people I've just said er and hinged\nThey have again targeted jak Philips and we talked about in the last hour but I Want you to hear or ATF has a lawyer and there's a there's a clip here we go\nHe's back in ... all over again um and so ATF on behalf of Mr Philips has not only helping him defend that action but as also filed affirmatively inaction in Colorado federal court saying that these violations of his religious free exercise rights\nNeed to be stopped a right at the courthouse skate so that he doesn't continue to be persecuted [noise]\nBook so to think about that thinking about this and and we discussed it in the last hour I don't want to build labor it but it's it's lunacy\nAnd you can't just say oh it's lunacy you have to you have to fight the lunacy otherwise Lucy is taking over so um anyway the alliance defending freedom they are in fact second to none in defending religious liberty including arguing in winning cases before the stream Supreme Court and they just said\nBut they do this for free it costs a lot of money so you might listeners can help right now with a gift to alliance defending freedom so we've been told that there's a matching grant\nThat they have not raised the full matching grant so it's still means that every penny you give is doubled so you have to go to ...

are an article not very long ago\nA ... at the year anniversary of the horror of what happened in Charlottesville a little bit over a year ago or I Want to talk to you about a little bit about that I where was that published\nThis was in the hill are saying okay they tell us about what you're saying that article what I said in this article it was about the so called social justice warriors tearing down the statue of a of a civil war a character which just happened just happened\nAnd they tore down into police stood by and they thought they were a virtue a posturing for the country and so I wrote an article say as a civil rights veteran I Am against\n'em on all Tripoli opposed to taking down those symbols those channels we first of all it's a waste of time it's a it's a distraction if symbols were related to substance than the safest places in America should be Martin Luther king boulevard\nBut it isn't it's the most dangerous places\nSo I I think that is it because symbols are important for us to just because you want to remember something doesn't mean you're in racing and celebrating at the very fact that the choose one is the Holocaust museum so that people will not remember\nAnd as I said in the column and the Christian cross we don't look at it and think about the oppression of Romans we bet because the story of the cross is the resurrection\nAre and so that's how we are too but if we don't have these symbols around and we will forget and so I just think that it's a it's a distraction for people on the left\nTo a as an act of a a social justice to take claim to be social justice warriors from taking them down\nAnd when we ought to be taking it does nothing for\nThe thousands of blacks were being killed in the inner city since so because we're taking attention away from those the the real problems facing America and that is\nThe violence the increase in drug addiction opioid overdoses uh there's so many other problems but it's a distraction and it's it's it's cheap posturing or that's going to ...\nAnd that's you know when he talked about cheap posturing I I really feel like the whole\nUh raised industry today it's become something that I I think to myself\nI Know many many uh African Americans and I went to college when I went to Yale University and he went to Yale University\nAnd they didn't grow up in a working class background\nI grew up in a working class background and so when you look at things to racial ends it really does become\nGenuine racism it it it you you you can't see beyond that lands and it seems like we've gone backwards and that right now people are insisting that we see everything through a racial ends I'm convinced that Dr King where he alive would speak against that\nWell executive director the second year allow the moms to earn toy vouchers by sewing by babysitting by performing certain chores that day with them or in a voucher and the toys that were collected were placed in a store\nSo the moms could shop for their own children are so this is the fundamental principle that we should follow when we're trying to help the poor\nAssume that they desire to they've got the ability to and the agency to help themselves that you should never do more for people than they are willing to do for themselves wow\nThat's I mean again that's perfect common sense\nBut the concept of dignity but it seems to have gone out of the culture it's not part of the vocabulary of this culture dignity now I Know that when I think of\nCivil rights heroes like Rosa Parks Dr King Jackie Robinson there was tremendous dignity it seemed to be the main thing you notice with these people dignity that's just not a word that you hear\nNo but all of our grassroots leaders that's what\nWhat what really has helped restore them is they their embrace of the ... the fundamental virtues and principles about founders\nFelt self determination we look for agency we look for an opportunity to help and so we go in with the expectation that you have the answers to your own problems\nAnd therefore we will give you help we will give you access to money we will give you access to training\nBut the solutions have to come from you I'm not going to come and paint your walls you pay for your own ball\nSo [laughter] that's I mean it it it's wise is funny it's funny\nTo me because it's so it's delightful to hear you say these things because it's obviously true and anybody but a fool recognizes this I mean this is basic human stuff unless you really have a view of people that is deeply patronizing\nYou recognize that that people want dignity people want to be able to work people want to be able to earn something but it's as if it's not as if a ... ... people cultural elites who have bought into these bad ideas are training\nOr people who are under privileged to think like victims entity that dignity is a dirty word you don't need dignity you don't need pride you don't need to just take because it's yours you deserve it and I\nI think that we're training people somehow to think against themselves like people\nHave needs but more important than that they need to be needed\nThere there was a big spiritual statement all you know I mean I really need to\nBe needed but also a lot of well as you are a lot of us suffer from intellectual leaders that when we come to an educated\nLow income people we always come is if we have something to offer yet nothing to receive I always approached people with the expectation that I'm going to leave here better as a consequence of me meeting

woods in a a\nCenter is but you guys I Can't even imagine how or over all these decades\nWell I can tell you some examples of that we work with Jack Kemp\nA for seven years when he was in Congress
