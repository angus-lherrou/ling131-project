FBI or investigation background check take place\nSo I mean I I I've been waiting to see some some good polling that hasn't really come out yet or looking at where where people and it looked like the country is divided but Republican given how the Democrats are already energized for the midterm election Republicans were a little more apathetic I think on a whole Bit.ly benefits Republicans especially when it comes to hold the Senate\nBut I only I I'm not talking about but I think this is a seminal moment for the country they cannot allow this you know that a young journalist was attacked on Twitter yesterday for allegedly having committed a sexual assault\nOr in college and I'm not repeating who it is or what I think it's been removed but that's the new McCarthyism Josh everyone will be vulnerable to this\nI I think you're making a very good point Andrew Sullivan had I had a very good at all in New York magazine basically emphasizing that point that you know due process and we have to process even if it's not a legal trial like but the\nPresumption of innocence a very very important standard I speak that liberals make them ... you know write them questions about Kavanaugh's testimony is credibility\nOr if they're going to comment about drinking and atomic about a year but in in the hearing but I also think that we can make it\nYour first question that leap in forward that testimony as well we really don't know\nI think the FBI investigation looking at the the event trying to figure out you know talking to people who are out this alleged party a twenty five years ago that might actually maybe give a little bit of clarity and may help us trying to figure out what actually happened\nBut ultimately I think it's more likely we kind of a week from now or are just as confused and just as I'm sure of what actually\nHappened everywhere when my my reporting is that Mitch files for cloture tonight then that the cloture vote will be Wednesday and a final vote on Thursday because the FBI investigation is not that difficult to do not that many witnesses to speak you have any other reporting on that\nAre you you're forty ... is the head of mine so I mean that sounds like it I mean I Know they want to get up at the one we get the maximum type table and there's a limited number of witnesses limited scope of this investigation I think they want to get this done sooner rather than later\nBut you know as you know been hearing Democrats are ready to questions about you know how many people at the FBI is allowed to interview and every time the lead on able to investigate it or are they going to be obstruction\n[laughter] and I am by the way filing for cloture doesn't mean that the FBI investigation Spanish it just means that they expected to be finished by Wednesday and that is six days after and there are I think and max six or seven witnesses and they've already all filed statements and so there is just\nThere just isn't much to review here and Dr forwards testimony is has been summarized by the council for the Republican than adequately distributed Josh cross our thank you my friends like all of you for listening a call your senator two two two to four three one two one tell them you know they may not want to have it on the court\nReally set a breakneck face this he's got Mike Gallagher show we got a crucial midterm election coming up November sex we're not going to make America great again it was never that\nThree ... voice of clarity from millions of America\nFor add up to a show\nNow owned by the most famous man on a plan\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studios mice yellow there\n[noise] so how\nIs your weekend you're ready for the bloodbath ready for the street fight one week this was going to be and you know what at least we have each other [laughter] at least we have each other to\nHang on to we prayed together we fight together we come together every day at this time to uh\nJust short event I Know you're angry I I Know and I read your emails over the weekend course to your calls last week\nI get it I Know you're angry\nPlease allow me pleased allow\nMe to do to give you a gentle reminder complaining about Jeff Flake is linear equivalent of complaining about the weather oh it's too hot well it's too cold man it's in the rain too much today oh it's\nToo humid it doesn't matter he's leaving he's leaving he one of the shocking admissions from last night's conversation but he engaged in on sixty minutes\nIs that he would never have pulled what he pulled friday if he had been up for reelection I mean he he did say that ... I don't know if you watch the sixty minutes interview it was painful everything about Jeff Flake is painful but\nAt but you have to at least acknowledging paddling others just cut number eight from sixty minutes\nI'm Senator Jeff flake who stunned the world with his painful change of heart over Brett Kavanaugh friday\nAfter he was yelled at by a couple of progressive activists in the elevator and I I'm not trying to minimize or deny that one or both of them were sexually assaulted I don't know\nKnow that they are both activists with ... with George Soros funded\nOrganizations that's a fact that you can look it up at certain names and we can get into all that if you want so Jeff Flake gets yelled at in the elevator kept looking up and certainly if you saw that video cameras painfully aware that it was all being recorded\nKnew immediately it was going to go viral because it was what they wanted\nAnd they got their wish they got him to change his mind and say okay well all voted out of committee but I'm not going to vote to confirm unless there's a one week and his investigation limited in scope\nAnd time that's already been shredded by the Democrats they were barely out of the room before they started calling\nThe limitations on scope and time a joke\nA sham a farce they started moving the goalposts before they got out of the room fried okay\nHere's Jeff Flake on sixty minutes last night admitted that if he had any accountability whatsoever to his own constituents in the state of Arizona He would never have done what he did on friday\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could ... who have done that [noise]\nIf you were running now you know not ... not a chance to show\nBecause politics has become too sharp\nTo ... there was no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nThat's one way to put it another way to put it is I have no accountability anymore because I'm retiring from the Senate show my constituents don't matter doesn't really matter what they want from me back home on quitting\nThat's one way that's another way to look at it but again I jet Li remind you it really matters not\nWhat he did friday in terms of getting this done\nThere are lots of things you can do today to take some action I'm going to give you that information as the show unfolds but it's futile to rage against a man like Jeff Flake remembering the bottom line and this sounds callous\nIt sounds cruel this sounds heartless which sounds [noise]\nUm wouldn't perhaps but it is a fact we still need his vote\nWe still need his vote he still has to vote to confirm so to to rip him\nFiguratively apart isn't really that productive you want to be productive college office

cabinet gets confirmed\nAnd it's crucial because this involves way more than just one man has a lot more to do\nThere's a lot more at stake than just Brett Kavanaugh will get into that in just a couple of moments as well but I Want you to uh she the White House trade advisors on Fox News over the weekend this was cut number one here is the way Peter Navarro describes what President Trump has done with our economy and trade\nPresident Donald Trump is very quietly been putting together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history [noise]\nAnd ah it's it's

lot of a lot of really really scary stuff happening in this country\nOver the weekend Jeff Flake made the rounds ah he was with\nHis buddy uh Chris Coons a Democrat from Delaware a flake with his shocking announcement friday that he was changing his mind and he had been a psychologist for Brett Kavanaugh he asked for another week\nOf the FBI to conduct a seventh investigation limited in time and the scope all ready to Democrats or Halloween already there screaming I'm already they are complaining about the limitations on the time and stroke they're calling the investigation a sham um there's not going to be any\nSatisfying conclusion you know that in terms of the FBI investigation there won't be there will be nobody is going to be happy with what the next few days\nThat's where we are unfortunately as a country what matters is getting judge Kavanaugh confirmed at this point unless something emerges that is conclusive that somehow corroborate each the claims that he did any of this stuff\nWhat we know so far is that the witnesses to Dr Christine laws you forge allegation have not corroborated what she said in fact they said they don't know what she's talking about and they don't have any rent a memory of it they there's no affirmation\nI Am very sensitive and mindful of the fact that there are undoubtedly sexual assault victims who don't have cooperation it does have to boil down to\nIn this case undoubtedly he said she said and when Brett Kavanaugh went to the table and dramatically defended his name\nDramatically defended\nAnd explain ex ex claimed with rage and grief what he and his family have witnessed\nThat that kind of turned everything as well because you got to people the accuser and the accused who sounded and looked and sounded credible\nOver a thirty six year old allegation well first things first Jeff Flake he is who he is he's resigning he's leaving the Senate I saw a lot of\nComments and certainly on social media we need to vote him out

it's civil but his firm and as a voice for decency\nHe has unwittingly perhaps\nUnleashed all kinds of demons now with what he did friday ... the least of which are the activists\nWho are emboldened by St shrieking and screaming and cornering people in elevators and in restaurants and in public places I saw it all weekend on social media desk says why we get in those evil Republicans faces because it can work\nWe can change their mind\nAnd obviously Jeff lakes mind was changed by the two women\nWho are activists to both that has been confirmed are activists with a George funded\nGeorge
