do you need to at least the private jet Gary girl\nI donate I donate please I when we got listeners joking that the president said they're forced one bring everybody to Washington you know low on them all up have a big party well listen we're we're having a party\nPhilosophically about the jobs numbers and and of course job creators network has been such an integral part of the tax cuts the good news today the wheels are ... announced the U.S jobless rate\nDropped a three point seven percent it's that's the lowest it's been nearly fifty years your lane\nSuch great news you guys have got to be bouncing off the walls with the job that the job creators network has played with the these tax cuts in with this great news about jobs jobs jobs in America it's\nLike a real winters here are the thirty million small business owners that continue to thrive under the economy and the pro growth but how is that the administration earlier this week I had an op ed on real clear politics\nWhich actually focused in on how women are flourishing under the economy and we're seeing more women start businesses and re enter the workforce and you asked if I was a mom you know historically childcare has has acted\nAs a barrier for women and a look the workforce and entrepreneurship and um another a benefit of a tax cuts in job that you know not only have we reduce tax rates across the board for everyone\nBut we also doubled the child tax credit and that's where an adoption and that's an absolute reduction off your tax bill right and then for those who are at the lower end of the income\nSpectrum there is a fourteen hundred dollar refundable tax credit that natural payout for ... like that and and in many cases that can help offset a lot of your childcare costs\nI'm not a huge benefit\nThat is indeed and and job creators network has been in the in the front ... on the front lines of so many of these important issues I Know that you guys have put on your radar Amazon\nAnd and they're lobbying for a higher minimum wage is seen some of these protests around the country and of course there's a real simple formula that's happening in ... for example in the service industry\nMcDonald's fast food they're they're being confronted with the demand for a higher minimum wage\nMcDonald says you know what we're ... that that we're not going to make a profit were business to make a profit so you know we'll do find will replace all of these human beings with kiosks and we're seeing this all across the board where companies have to wisely invested in technology\nAnd and you know robots an automated systems and kiosks because when you're demanding Fifteen Eighteen twenty bucks an hour it doesn't work you lame\nLike and that is true let me start by saying and\nI think any company that has the right to pay their employees whatever they want and I applaud Amazon for wanting to pay their employees\nMore money from where I draw the line is pool where they said that they want to um help increase it and work with legislators and lobby than to increase the federal minimum wage would hurt many of our thirty million small businesses out there\nAnd certainly seen the impact of that in cities like Washington on the in Seattle we think people not only hours and and the money that we've seen businesses closed their doors\nYou know they just don't have the resources to offset that kind of way to increase right\nYou're right and I'm Glad you guys or or or you're on the case I Love what you're doing let's keep fighting tax cuts work

right at ten thirty but I understand now they are beginning the procedure Senator Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader spoke\nUm and now I Believe they're making the announcement to er and Dan let me know when you're ready to go and will take you back to Washington DC hitch crunch time and uh this is Jeff won the cloture vote 'em and this is when we find out if Republicans\nBut to me how you doing Jim welcome to the dollar to show\nThat you uh it it comes from the education system and the philosophy behind that education system and they operate on the philosophical axiom that perception is reality\nSo your your perception of what happened is your reality which you and I know it's not true right as if somebody believes a pillow or or seems a pillow as a wrong ticket and after Iraq you have a they quickly learn that perception is not real\nWell that that's an interesting way of looking at it so that that but maybe you're right maybe the belief is your perception is reality therefore that stands and frankly most Americans that's wrong that's not a normal logical understandable process freaking now\nOn the Mike Gallagher show All right the Senate has voted fifty one forty nine to advance the Kavanaugh's nomination there was a fifty one to forty nine vote and a shockingly to some Lisa Murkowski voted no\nIt was believed that Lisa Murkowski could be this was again considered one of the big swing votes one of the undecideds she voted no which of course signal she's going to be a no vote tomorrow in the full confirmation process\nHowever senators flake Collins and mansion Joe mansion from West Virginia\nCame through and voted yes so you've got fifty one to forty nine vote if you were to lose some how in the next twenty four hours or any of those three flake Collins or mentioned say one say last one of them let's say I don't know\nSusan Collins decides to join Lucia Murkowski in voting no\nYou still have ... the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh because my parents as the president of the set it breaks the breaks the tie he cash the deciding vote and uh you would win by one on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh Michelle is reacting to lose your Murkowski's vote how you doing the show\nFamily Guy 'cause like\nI Would actually turn your radio down for me five before the hour here again fifty one to forty nine the cloture vote go ahead Michele\n[noise] I was just my comment as as you know I I left a message on my case I'm selling things you know to the desert for about half an hour and a woman on I hadn't been actually south of that I just find it interesting that seat with ... with all these protesters are sexually\nAbused women are the ... to ... and not hear another side of the story she immersed herself into just being completely brainwashed by all of that which I feel like that's how she voted today I'm really disgusted by it\nIt's just it's a shame it's a real shame and I and I believe again just like Heidi Heitkamp is going to be the former senator from North Dakota Lisa Murkowski is now going to be\nThe former senator from it from a from Alaska she betrayed or voters\nAnd she said no but thankfully we've got enough yes vote so I think we're going to get them across the finish line [noise]\nHaving up your reaction to this historic day will take a lot of calls were streaming up my online dot com

most famous man on the planet even grade Mike and I appreciate\nIt very much notice I walked over here\nVery quickly now from the relief factor dot coms mice yeah like [noise]\n\nI Am by nature are pretty optimistic person I Am cautiously optimistic right now [noise] however I Want to warn you that\nDo believe anybody who\nSays they know how this drama this nightmare frankly over the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh is going to end\nWe don't know what we do know is that Brett Kavanaugh survived a crucial vote moments ago in the Senate\nAnd senators Jeff Flake Susan Collins and Joe Manchin from West Virginia Democrat across the aisle and voted with his Republican colleagues as yes votes\nPerhaps the big shocker was the Republican from Alaska Lisa Murkowski who voted no in the cloture vote to advance the Kavanaugh nomination the cloture vote past fifty one to forty nine\nNow the clocks charge towards this weekend's confirmation if mansion flake and Collins stick with their yes boats and that's not a foregone conclusion\nIt's probable but it is not sure if they do that's the final vote on the confirmation and Brett Kavanaugh will start hearing cases from the bench of the United States Supreme court next week\nUm however both Joe mansion and Susan Collins have suggested that their first vote might not reflect their final vote Susan Collins being reported is going to confirm how she's voting tomorrow\nThis afternoon at three PM eastern time show\nAs of now there's also lots of speculation about Lisa Murkowski possibly voting yes in the end but it doesn't seem like it does not seem particularly\nLikely that she will change your vote from today till tomorrow wow what a day the president has tweeted moments ago he set out a tweet that says and I quote\nVery proud of the U.S Senate for voting yes to advance the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh dishes up this is a battle royale um that's a bloodbath\nAnd the middle of all this drama\nComes some very fascinating statistics some data if your data driven you're going to you're going to like to hear some of this news first of all the daily presidential tracking poll is kicked up from Rasmussen you just picked up again\nFor the president right now the Rasmussen Reports daily presidential tracking poll for friday today shows the fifty one percent\nOf likely us voters approve\nOf President Trump's job performance forty eight percent disapprove\nLast check this for me but I think this was the highest it's been Rasmussen says the president took office um it's you know you can say that the majority now for the first time perhaps of likely us voters approve of the job the President Trump is doing\nWhat's remarkable ... what's remarkable about that is to consider how much has been thrown at him for two years\nThe entire enormous machine the Republicans in the swamp the media but Democrats activists Hollywood New York\nI mean they have tried desperately to slow this guy down and to stop him but you know what's not it's you know you you know what's hard for them to swallow it's not work\nAnd there's incredible economic news that was revealed revealed today this is extraordinary news and and and all kinds of good news optimism among us manufacturers continues to shore\nAccording to the national association of manufacturers nearly Ninety three percent of manufacturers are projecting further expansion for their businesses\nPositive sentiment among small companies is up to Ninety One point three percent unemployment is at the lowest was announced this morning we are unemployment rate is down to three point seven percent\nYou know the last time America's unemployment rate was a three point seven percent Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd of course you hear this stuff and you say would smoke wonder but the president's approval ratings continue to grow up he's doing what he said he was going to do\nAnd even the never Trump or his you're paying attention Brad Stevens from the New York times he is a fears never Trump he's the kind of conservative in New York Times approves of he wrote a piece yesterday but frankly is is is sure to get him fired\nI I mean I'm I'm not saying that to be gloom and doom for him I I don't want to hear anybody getting fired but nonetheless registry but she has written\nColumn after column if Mr rating President Trump rage yesterday for once I'm grateful for him he says for the first time since Trump better the political fray I find myself grateful that he was in it I'm reluctant to admitted he wrote I'm astonished to say it\n\nI'm grateful because Trump hasn't backed down in the face of the slippery miss hypocrisy and dangerous standard shedding deployed by opponents of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court I'm grateful he writes because ferocious and even crash opposite history\nHas it uses in life and never more so than in the face of slide moral bullied I'm grateful because he's a big fat hammer
