Ninety am used talk nine Ninety dot com\nIntelligent conservative radio news stories\nAnd I am in Ninety\nComeback America from the relief factor dot com studios it's your\nVoice challenge but eager to talk to my next guest David Evans he's the director of the brand new movie in the visible which will be in theaters this Friday it's the true story of army chaplain Darren Turner a David Evans welcomes great to have you on the Hugh Hewitt she'll tell us about indivisible\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really hear the first movie ever made about a military chaplain you know there's been chaplains that have been featured with with supporting roles and movies over the years but um I heard about this story about Chaplin Darren Turner and his wife for about six years ago\nI'd taken a long time to get this project put together but I'm really it's an incredible story that I think will appeal to your listeners when you can see what troops experience during times of deployment\nThrough the eyes of a chaplain who's really kind of like the pastor to the troops but when you see first hand what the experience of what they're dealing with a and then you know at the same time their marriage as well as under attack as it is so often with\nWith our troops when they leave their husbands and wives behind a just a powerful story of of of the people who whether you're married or not it's a story that's really going to speak to you um when you see this film\nDavid Evans I've got lots of military in my family and I've heard it said again and again I'm a civilian but I married a Marine Corps brat and which is lots of military active duty\nThat whenever a soldier sailor airman or Marine Corps um and go off on deployment they come back a different men or women and their spouse is a different man or woman and they left a do capture that in indivisible\n... absolutely in in a in a very vivid accurate way I Believe we use the chaplains actual journal that he kept while he was in Iraq so we kinda get into into what they're going through by by reading his journal and and then incorporating that into our entire script you know it's so often that\nI'm as Americans we take for granted that the freedoms that we have and\nIt's really about one percent of the population that that's connected directly to the military through a spouse who's serving or or having a child who's an active duty for this other Ninety nine percent of people that I think really are going to appreciate the story yet entertainment value they're great visual effects and and a score\nBut it's the it's the deep rooted story about what our troops are going through that I think will really speak to people\nAnd um I'd like to also and you it's a perfect date movie if there's a husband and wife out there and they're your your your listeners are looking for something to do this weekend or you know you can cast a vote for or faith based quality films like this by going to see the movie on opening weekend the perfect perfect film for\nFor husbands and wives to go out and watch together\nAnd this is the studio that also brought a fireproof in war roommate really succeeds they make wonderful movies as says of course David Evans it got very experienced directorial credits but what strikes me is especially\nIf you have a member of the military and your family whether it's a son or daughter husband or wife grandma grandpa anyone who deploys I Want you to go see this movie so that you understand the friends of someone you go to church with someone who's got a spouse deployed\nUnderstand how hard it is for that spouse as well as for the frontline soldier sailor airman marine coast guard but that\nIs you know I think indivisible has got a lot of great stuff going forward with Sarah truant adjusted and ruining in David evidence but what's really got going for it as an audience that's going to finally see their lives reflected on the screen\nYes here which we've heard that over and over again from some of the military screenings and and community screenings were done already is people say that was me in that scene I saw myself on the screen\nAnd you know with Veterans Day coming up just a couple of weeks away that's a great opportunity for someone after you've seen the film to say you know what I Know someone who needs to see this and go out and give them a ticket and say thank you for your service and it's something that that really all of us needs experience because it's not so often that like this film\nCan come along based on a true story of a military couple\nUm especially one told through the odds are chapel and\nI Love you know the alliance defending freedom great sports of our show has a separate group to vote adjusted chaplains and chaplains very rarely get the credit which they deserve their in every battlefield they're on every front line taken care of the men and women and the troops and I'm Glad someone finally made a movie about David thank you\nThank thank you so much yeah it's it's an important role in like you said one we often\nTake for granted but in the case of chaplain Darren Turner he's in Iraq dealing with the problems facing a thousand troops\nAnd ah you know his own relationship begins to to deteriorate with his own spouse and that's what we see kind of play out in the film and how how um they're able to piece things back together and and today they go round counseling other couples that military marriage or treats around the country which is another great thing that people really are not aware of that happening\nThe hash tag or the Twitter feed is indivisible move him Ovie indivisible move it opens on friday coast to coast go find your theater near you or visit the website for independent indivisible movie to find out where it's closer to David Evans thank you my friend\nAh thanks for putting up with a voice it's a lot better that was yesterday I couldn't even do anything yesterday Bob

by the most famous man on a plan\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly now\nThe relief factor dot com studio Mike yeah like [noise]\n\nThere were a lot of the same reaction to this pipe bomb story was probably the most and she came from the head of CNN [noise] and [noise] I I just have to take a moment to remind you [noise] what Americans\nFace with a a contempt Jewish media a media that hates us so badly\nHave the deplorable and I am so glad that I'm wearing a T shirt today that you may want to check out on the stream it was a gift it was a gift from a listener here in the Dallas Fort Worth area\nAnd it's a it's actually a cute T shirt or if you and you've got to know your musical theater\nUh in order to appreciate the meaning of my T shirt today\nSo you can check it out at Mike online dot com\nOr and hit the click to watch my country the button but the president of CNN jumped ... Jeff Zucker issued a statement after these pipe bombs were received and it's really they were thankfully harmless\nThere is no real apparent literal physical threat with these pipe bombs\nNonetheless hours after CNN New York city headquarters were evacuated the networks president issued a statement\nCondemning not the bomber knocked a maniac who did it not the lunatic who would or the hoax stir or whoever whatever word you want to use\nThe blame President Trump and the White House and Sarah Sanders saying they should understand their words matter\nIn other words CNN can call Donald Trump Hitler all day long and there's no accountability there\nBut as soon as some maniac Sam's these just brushes packages and these pipe bombs to all these prominent Trump haters that Trump's straight\nBeen continued the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter much more they have shown no comprehension of that now let me tell you what has to happen let them do this\nDo you dare\nDo you go down this path normal Americans are seeing this garbage gene Trump blamed for everything from hurricanes literally\nThe pipe bombs you're my aunt birth is get out and you know what America is going to go to the polls and reject the left\nThey're going to send a message to CNN and the Jeff Zucker is of the world you're not going to get to win this thing\nDo you dare go down that path please I Am begging you don't say you do have regrets did this as part of a hoax I get that I understand that I appreciate that don't make that mistake let the facts come to you\nIf we find out and they'll catch whoever did this\nIf they find out this was some kind of a Bernie Sanders supporter like the guy who tried to kill the Republicans on the baseball field if we find out this was a member of a you know Planned Parenthood or this is a Democrat\nOperative trying to create havoc bullied me the floodgates all open people will then say\nLook at what they did\nBut if they find out to conservatives who hates Trump arming who hates the media and hate Democrats and love Trump\nThen guess what what gets you going to open on us and you know what may happen people are going to say well look at all you people who said it was a Democrat hoax they're already saying\nAnd where do Jonathan around Mike Allen over it actually is there is a conspiracy theory being perpetuated by radio host all over the country well not this one I'm not going to do it I'm not going to stop you or stifle you from saying what you want to stay and believe me what you believe\nBut we got too many people who are so quick to blame the president for everything including Republicans just picked up all Republicans like the governor of Ohio John ... the man who would be king he wanted to be president so badly\nBut he's just down with his buddy yogurt MSNBC Brian Williams sisters ... number three from MSNBC and gravy\n\nTrain does and that's part of the reason why I never endorse them and I've never been personally critical of him about yeah he does bear responsibility for the divisions are as the biggest megaphone\nJohn Cage six says sure he does Donald Trump does bear responsibility for the for\nThe uh the tone of America John Cage to catch never gotten over the fact that this fighter\nBeat him John Case because never recovered from the fact that Donald Trump has fought in a way that we have never seen the president quite in our lifetime ever John Cage he doesn't know how to play ball that way that is what John Case it lost\nIts why he will always be a failed presidential candidate\nAnd all of these people who have been beaten by Donald Trump love to sit on the sidelines like little like little\n... and try to bite and ... and nip away at the president of the United states\nIt's disgusting it's just [noise] gusty\nGuest what let the Trump haters do it\nAmericans are going to go to the polls in less than two weeks in about a week and a half Americans going to go to the polls and they're going to push Republicans crossed the finish line in the Senate and then the house and in the gubernatorial races were not going to see a blue wave or go see a red wave\nAnd I beg you not to contribute don't don't match ... feet from the jaws of political victory because this is a political story and too much is at stake\nWe want to welcome you into

been chaplains in a supporting roles in films over the years but this is a true story\nTold about a military chaplain and even someone who is an active duty today are at Fort Bragg and so I think people really want to going to resonate with this film and uh you know it's a true story told through the eyes of a military chaplain\nWho is lifted and um and you know along deployment and it's really a picture of what our troops go through during these deployments when they come home and the whole reintegration process of getting to know their husband or wife all over again and the toll it can take on marriage is\nAt the end of the day the relevance of this movie is so so crucial it's one of one of the things I Love about telling audiences about individual talk about the relevance of

Nineteen Seventy eight ... voice some clarity for millions of American idols oh\nWe'll just have a credit card even if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house and George Clinton started\nShowing owned by the most famous man on the planet\nEven great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly now\nFrom the relief factor dot com studio Mike\n[noise] we are in the middle of an incredible time [noise] the president tweeted today a very big\nPart of the anger we see today is our society is caused by the purposely falls in an accurate reporting of the mainstream media but I refer to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description mainstream media much clean up its act fast well the mainstream media\nDoubles down and says this is all his fault these pipe bombs at least just vicious packages that have been sent to prominent Democrat critics of President Trump um we've had a voice of reason in this country lately\nUh last night you know in a room of about a thousand people in Irving, Texas\nRight outside Dallas we had a an event on stage where Sean Spicer my colleagues Larry Elder Dennis Prager Mark Davis and I were talking about all of these important volatile issues\nAnd I mentioned the name Senator Lindsey Graham at a roar went up the lecture which I haven't heard in a long time I know he's feeling the love about everywhere he goes because many of us believe that we're not for Lindsey Graham's\nPassion and his heart felt\nAnguish over the way the process of judge Kavanaugh played out he wouldn't be justice justice capital today what a what a joy is to bring back to the Mike ... show Senator Lindsey Graham from the Palmetto State of South Carolina Senator Graham want a time to be alive ha\nAnd Mike I'm trying to make the guy that won the lottery I don't know who he is but I'm trying to find it\nBut he's in your state right I mean listen can I all I Need ten million if you if you get five I'll take I could do five or seven and you know we'll be All right [laughter] well you know if his or try\nTo get mine and I get more and so that's\nThe good no kidding I write he'd get fringe group he'd get three groups and you get one of ice cream Senator Graham honestly do last last night I mean here we are in Dallas texas and here's hundreds\nAnd hundreds of people roaring their approval for just for your name or so appreciative of your voice and and I I just got to get the Lindsey Graham\nThirty five thousand feet view of of what the of the time we're living in this investigation is a chance to find these suspicious packages CNN's Jeff Zucker immediately blamed President Trump what is what a Senator Lindsey Graham say about the last twenty four hours of this very nervous a dangerous time\nWhere you take your frustrations out at the ballot box to support your fingers to portray causes appropriately I don't blame President Trump but this any more than a blank Bernie for the guy who shot\nStates ... and tried to kill a bunch of congressman Rosa Bernie supporter but Bernie doesn't support that or this person is obviously sending bombs to critics said the president that's not the way we do business in America hope they get caught\nHope they go to jail and I hope and about Thirteen Days republic when at the ballot box because we deserve to get reelected\nAnd that's the answer the only answer we have we got to be the the the we have a big boy pants on we can't play all around and and point fingers of blame the wrong time to do this because frankly Senator Graham seems very clear Republicans have a great deal of momentum heading into November ...\n[laughter] no question about it I'm so cabin I think most people were trying to say to you and to my cell phone I made um is it thank you for speaking a thank you for speaking in a in a fashion\nThat if I were there I Would have said the same thing less than what they were trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh who I've known for Twenty years as destroying his life to keep the seat open\nTo make sure that Democrat could set within twenty twenty they actually said that\nThey play dirty and they lost I'm Glad I called them out I had all I could take after the ...\nNot because of it chose them but that was I thought they were qualified Thurmond butter pecan spurts a ... to people from South Carolina the games play differently now and what they were trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh I'll bet I'll hope there's a backlash at the ballot box\nAnd I hope we pick up seats and they get punished for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little personal issue because of you for a long time and I respect them to do it on ... you know that all the years that I've been on the radio I said Senator Lindsey Graham is a good and decent man I met you in Washington ... early in my talk radio career you told me something that's stuck with but you said Mike I came to Washington\nNot to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things across the finish line\nThere's a belief and I and I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings are a big because I respected him argue and I know you for a long time there is a belief that with your friendship with the late Senator McCain\nYou were sort of restrained a little bit and with his passing it like Lindsey unleashed its Lindsey Graham the way South Carolina south Carolinians have known him for many many years is there any merit to that Senator Graham\nNow people are thinking way too hard ah here's the deal or\nIf you know anything about may have tried to be a supporter of an independent judiciary are are traditionally needs to be independent of politics John McCain was dares friend he voted against so tomorrow and cake cameras heart asked when it came to judges [laughter] so the bottom line is\nI could never done to set them aren't Kagan what they were doing to protect Kevin ... they were misrepresenting his life\nThey trade that for ward and there's no doubt in my mind something happened to ... report but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it or they tried to ruin his family\nAnd they said if you're really innocent or not you asked for this charade to continue and that's what I lost it is when Durban ask Kevin out attorney Don McGahn to White House counsel if he really had nothing now I wanted to ask for this to continue they present him guilty not innocent\nEverything that I Believe in as a lawyer a was was basically trampled on and\nI pushed back in his do more complicated than that\nWell we're ... on a nation is grateful for you and your push back many believe I mean is it is it an overreach to say that that that that your voice your speech your passion helped the confirmation occur\nWell here's what I Would say number one I Want to congratulate President Trump for picking Brett Kavanaugh who's the great legal mind of his generation his resume of being a judge was unquestioned is integrity he's just a great guy I think what happened\nIs that I gave voice\nTo those on our side who said\nAlready rise it always are judges Mike why is it always Clarence Thomas and board and Alito and now it's cabinet why is it all up to our people\nRight and they wanna they wanna went too badly over the place where they if they Republican had done this to mail democratic nominee we'd be crucified oh we'd be ... for these people and you're\nAnd if it's a democratic male nominee lady from South Carolina dumps demand gives me a letter an asset on it never shared it with the committee that day to me if I recommended a conservative lawyer never told the lady from South Carolina oh by the way the Democrats would come here to meet you they'd be a riot in the street\nOr without the press so so I just got mad I was pissed I Know you were and they make about it that get tests to get\nSo hopefully with [laughter] well you know\nHere he is just as bad but I mean that battle was ... and and he's on the Supreme Court and maybe there'll be another conservative on the Supreme Court uh in in over the next few years Senator Lindsey Graham is whether it's let me ask you about the big burning issue that I think is the October\nSurprise we've got thousands and thousands\nOf people in what's being described as a migrant caravan um a lot of people who are concerned as much as ... as the country is an amateur in love with you right now there are a lot of us should ever have pushed back a little bit on on the issue of illegal immigration and and you have been at the you've been an interesting I bet it interesting voice in all of this\nWhere do you stand right now with these thousands of people who are marching towards the southern border uh and and and frankly I think from a political optics point of view something that is encouraging Republicans and independents people to go to the go to the polls and say\nWe can't have open borders we got to have shot renting we got to have a secure border\nWhat's your take on the the migrant caravan Senator Graham\nOr between Kevin on the care of and that that does that make you want to vote his Republican nothing ever will bigger an independent voter our hope you will come on our side\nI'm going to be practical when it comes to ... the immigration problem within our country if you've been here for decades and you got American citizen children uh them will treat you fairly you'll have to learn our language pay a fine getting back on the line\n\nTwenty seven minutes past the hour it's
