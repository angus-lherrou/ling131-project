to one eight hundred six five five six four or five three will send you the report in full you can read the whole thing is very illuminating it is very informative if you want to read the the ritual

here's Len Len thanks for hanging out with us how are you\nIn mind when good good you know we keep saying that uh the FBI does not come to conclusions they just record the activities of the accused however with Khomeini and investigating Hillary\nA came out with this big announcement that they come to the conclusion that there was no no no prosecutor would bring charges against her go\nTo the point I mean it's you know it is I mean we have to remember that but this amounts to as a as a seventh background check\nThis is not the kind of FBI investigation or special Bob Mueller as special counsel dragging on and on and carrying on for this is a background investigation this was interviewing people putting in a report what they said find that there's any cooperation looking at the corroborating witnesses talking to them\nAnd putting it in a report and given it to the Senate Judiciary committee that's all it is um and and that's I'm\nNot going to be satisfied anybody as we progress as I think but maybe it will be enough for some senators to vote yes including a couple of Democrats Chris welcome how are you crash\nI'm doing well my\nPoint I wanted to bring up was a personal one where my mom was sexually assaulted in the worst matter and I won't use the word you can imagine what I'm Talking about or\nAnd or almost put a put away and murdered and I'm share something with me the other day but doctor for that really made a lot of sense she said the testimony where she talks about going into the supermarket to say hello to um the accuser or one of the accuses that would never happen\nThat would never happen my mother couldn't even go into a shopping mall for years and could not when she had to face the accuser in court and and in a line up\nYour she's not going to say Hi to the guy in a grocery we're not going to say Hi to the guy had read about it why would you\nDid you hear the Lindsey Graham line about ... the woman who claimed that she witnessed gang rapes going on at ten parties after the first one do you think you'd go back nine more times\nYou got if you're watching my bad ideas yeah lots of ... lots of questions on very reluctant to question the credibility of accuser\nOnly because I'm mindful that and I said there's a million times there are lots of women who've been abused and sexually assaulted they had no corroborate shouldn't and they were utterly alone they lost their jobs they've lost their careers we've heard the stories and uh you know you can't read these stories and hear about some of these accounts\nEven yesterday Jeff Flake was at some event in Boston We're going to play some video and audio from that but that is why I think Jeff Flake as a as a no he's playing to the media does play into his Democrat friends and there were a bunch of people standing in the front rows of whatever event he was out in Boston holding up signs saying I was a sexual assault\nSurvivor or I'm a survivor or something like that and and honest to goodness I I I I feel great compassion for anybody who has been assaulted who's been attacked to has been um victimized and they got nowhere to go uh\nAnd and they were maybe in a in a in that happened in the workplace and had a powerful man who did this to them and they got nowhere to go um in in but the problem is it's a double edged sword\nNow you you have a woman coming forward late in the game because of the Democrats the eleventh hour making ...\nAccusation that has been countered by the passionate fiery response of of Brett Kavanaugh that makes

early church this is the fourth book and David series of Christian Bible guides\nFor people who want to learn more about their faith without you know becoming a bit of having to be a scholar or

he's struggling but we've we've ...\nHe's flattery we pray for him to first of all the Jesus as resident can we talk a little bit about this crossroads this this ... to a position of\nPolitics as you show brilliantly delivering your columns and in your appearances on Fox News and all and your deep faith but for some people makes them uncomfortable but frankly at at at at times like these I think I think that cross roads that intersection of faith and culture and politics is perfectly timed\nYes you know it's so interesting we have a situation that I got a bad act a little I don't know where you're not a great though okay I took this by the ... I the\nHomes were living in a very different because we have I Believe for the next ...\nThe survival of this country and we have I Believe in a very effective president and Donald Trump though I didn't initially support I supported that group I've been with Trump ever since he won the primaries adamantly or I'm we're facing the left\nYou know I I used to be this purists conservative constitutional conservative and I am a as I said on Sean Hannity's show last night at a back less than ... is an infinite conservative right\nAnd we and we like Trump because he fights back and get things done and I think he's actually become a pretty strong ideological conservative he's certainly unaffected one but we have the left\nOut of the woodwork trying to destroy him trying to destroy everything in his path including ... had been up\nAnd they think they have a monopoly on morality and I think they they're worldview is so ... I'm Sorry to say it and I think it's self\nAnd when you see I hate all they are how much they burn jak how much they aren't exactly the opposite of what they claimed to be I eat compassionate powering a loving their hateful they're mob there they'll do anything to destroy people the end justifies the means\nAnd so when when John Adams said that the constitution is only going to be a war only gonna work for a moral and religious people I think what he had in mind where people like the left who will destroy the court for example instead of upholding the constitution that legislate from the bench\nAnd end justifies the means they'll do whatever they want to do\nAnd we have to fight back and Christians who say we can't fight back because we're not being Christian they're wrong we have a duty we're not just on this earth to sit here as bystanders we have a duty to try to preserve this culture\nFor our kids and for ourselves and what made America the greatest nation in the world and so I don't buy into this thing that we ought to be passive we ought to be active in work or um but there's one other intersection and that is this is so controversial as so contentious in our culture that I think sometimes we need\nSomething greater to look to and that that's something greater in my view is Jesus Christ and so I think ... the books that I write on this subject are designed to get people into the Bible and reduce their intimidation and increase and accelerate their learning curve so that they will also\nBe more comfortable and going to read the Bible for itself and that's really my go\nI'm grateful for your voice but I'm grateful for this book because we're living in a time you know David to those who are who call them ... who are conservatives\nAnd spiritual people who oppose President Trump with everything that with every fiber of there being because they don't like his tone they don't like his tweets they don't like his temperament they don't like the kind of person he is\nWe're seeing what the alternative would have been to Donald Trump or seen it all displayed right now with this Kavanaugh debacle in all its glory the left is what we would have running things if it weren't for the election of Donald Trump\nLet me tell you know true words were ever spoken socialism\nOr leads to destruction it leads to poverty and ultimately as high it talked about at least ... you can see that as well you can see it in the in the left in the United states\nI said the other day on Twitter and I really mean that and I seem like a radical I seem unreasonable I see mine hands when I say this I Am not I'm pretty mainstream\nI Believe that the ... the far left and sadly that's encompassing all to larger of a component of the Democratic party where I Would put us in re education camps if they could have many of them would I mean look at the things that are good they have no clue thoughts about destroying Brett Kavanaugh and his family and and they don't have any complaints ...\nAnyone thought I understood radical I've I've read they've taken radical to new heights and it's and unfortunately in the face of today's Democratic Party in many cases David\n... yes in my ... think about what they're fighting for they are I sorry if this offends people they are fighting for the right\nTo twist the constitution into a pretzel so that it will allow them
