pat Campbell and boy we've got a truly fascinating report for you today in fact it's not an overstatement to say that high doses of an overlooked vitamin or in the process of revolutionizing western medicine as we know what in fact it promises to promote our health\nMore than anyone ever imagine support our immune system like nothing else can turn up our heart muscles and leg muscles make bones stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor in a sorority on vitamin D he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy\nOf this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor canal has never endorsed to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nHe not only doors is pure these advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it and joining us live from California doctor canal welcome back to the program thanks now doctors now I Know that your top you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the\nPast year or two on vitamin D you're saying the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you just a little bit about how I got into this because I think it would give some information about how this evolved about ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow\nDoctor's advice that our government's advice and we started putting on the sun block and staying out of the fun it had tremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it neat thing and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it\nFor getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it or taking the wrong preparation can learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and\nSecondly I said I'm by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil so what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can buy it in the store you can't buy it on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled the shore\nAnd let me ask you a question here 'cause I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case vitamin D can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\n... that's a good question let me just do one thing so people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just going to read off\nA list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins\nNewsweek or Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price are Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin\nBiting when does it do to your fingernails grow quicker\nThey become harder they become less brittle really shiny or it's really a remarkable change in your finger now but it takes more than a month because it takes about six months for the fingernails to grow up but these are things we can see and feel vitamin D. effects thirty six Oregon so wow I Can't feel what it's doing and you're paying ...\n[laughter] you know what it's doing for your blood pressure down you know or your prostate but what we're talking about is the immune system the pancreas the heart\nBlood pressure muscle strength and brain activity prostate health breast health colon health bone marrow teeth and gums kidney lung retina skin stomach uterus I mean I could go on but again because activated vitamin D is a steroid hormone\nIt can affect all these organs because there's two thousand genes that it is the key to those genes we've been jaded with vitamin claims vitamin C. and vitamin either going to feel better you're going to do this you're going to bed cetera and so people find it hard to believe I mean if I had them and they only did one thing they'd find it easier to believe\nYou mentioned Colin health hearing my family physician as a precautionary move will be on a pretty healthy dose of vitamin D what's the connection\nYeah what the reason you're gastroenterologist did that is because there's just a wealth of studies now that are coming out showing that coal and health and vitamin D levels are connected but at the same studies about breast tell the same studies about prostate health\nIs just like an insurance policy ... you're not not to take this and it's it's free you get in\nAnd the other thing I Want to say as though you're listening in five years I don't want you to say I didn't know about this I was never told ... you've been polled out right now you're being told for example in a number of places in the country if you walk into the emergency room with anything that might be your heart you know what they do\nGet a hundred thousand units right off the bat first thing a hundred thousand years of vitamin D day and then they keep giving\nThem an dam failure to question speaking of the cardiovascular system and I know you could probably talk for about thirty minutes on this talk about its role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system\nJust recently there have been a slew of studies out of the best universities in the world all connecting your vitamin D level to your heart health there's a study for example out of Harvard by a friend of mine professor Edward given ichi and his conclusion was pretty stark here it is quote\nLow levels of vitamin D or associated with higher risk integrated man\nEven after controlling for known risk factors that is even after they control for smoking high blood pressure high triglycerides diabetes all the things known to contribute even after they control for that\nThere was a ... wrong effect of vitamin D day and we don't have enough studies yet to say that you know if you have heart disease you should take vitamin D although many cardiologist are prescribing it just on the basis of why not\nFor the way these doctors are thinking is it looks like from the studies there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficiency\nWe don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now but it would be unethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient\nWhile we're conducting all the studies we need to the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're a levels thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay level needs to be fifty or higher and to get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most of them best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself is a standalone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were ... and I you tablets but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get was purity here why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university that shows that when you get your\nWell the fifty your body has enough\nFor all the things that need to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D so if your level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to think of vitamin D as a mountain spring\nWith a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone and we've taken enough vitamin D data halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other pools below with the breath pool the colon pool the immune system poll all the other polls that are blow it have been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the tank resell all these pool\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit\nFor a rainy day have a little bit of a surplus yet but you don't do that unless you're levels around fifty\nBy the way Dr ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three fish oil the free bottled fish oil both of these are thirty days supplies\nAnd all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight\nTo zero now Dr can talk to me about the link between vitamin D\nAnd body weight what's the research showing well\nThat is maybe fifty studies out there that show a real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D ... but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues think lose that we know about mood that is\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitude\nSo those were closed but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we hope inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ...\nThat's become clear just recently for example a paper in the British Journal of nutrition they studied women who were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and takes lost more weight than the women really at the lower vitamin D and take it\nAnd then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial is the highest standard of proof we have in medicine and this was thirty six thousand people\nAnd they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take ... to Monday\nSo that's another reason plus\nSince courteous giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the official ... you know of course that there's research that shows that fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reasons to believe the two things together will help\n[noise] now don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe that is so vitally important that they give this formula attract\nWell you know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health coal in health breast health prostate health pancreatic health own health the immune system I could go on and on the main reason that\nPeople will continue to take this if you just give it a try for a month is how you feel you're get up and go you're feeling of wellbeing that's what you notice now if you take it for several months or year you'll notice a lot of different chain\nThank

not been evaluated by the anti angers product is not intended to diagnose trees to prevent any diseases\nWhich so much of it has been negative towards the administration and and not really wanted to give credit to an economy that seems to be doing very very well\nHere we have these plaques in the markets and it's almost being sensationalized because of the political overtones to it we might have the first president that that are now gone out and in public criticize the Federal Reserve and tried to influence them and\nI said hey why not you can speak I speak my question is this\nHealthy type of pull back or is there something internal going on that is going to surprise us and the markets are trying to tell us that there's some systemic problem in the system\nWas I'd love to tell you I have a crystal ball and tell you how this was going to try\nAnd when you do I just want you to look down and tell me what's in that first of all [laughter]\nI Will tell you I ... I Will say this I Will say that\nUm you know we experiences who will pull back at the beginning of the year you know in January and February [noise]\nUm there was a particular day I think we actually saw it was February fed the market actually felt more on that day that it could yesterday and it took some time to recover if there were some ripple effects across global how's classes um but really you know give us equity markets stage quite a rally so\nI don't know that um I think it's premature right now to tell whether or not there's a systemic I'm sort of aren't and I do know the the things we're looking on are going to be um prevents like you know\nWill defend talk about ah what they could give guidance on monetary policy and a twenty Nineteen that's a bit more to others [noise] um I think um if we continue to see positive correlation of stocks and bonds I think the fed will be uncomfortable with that um and I think\nUm I think rightfully so because you know I think\nA lot of investors are going to look at the market and they're going to actually encourage more risk averse Patel I'm so I'm On the radar or on my radar is is is really sort of fed comments and fed guidance for twenty Nineteen I think I think it December rate hike is probably baked in a cake must be have a material down shift and asked the price of\n'em that being said you know I'm also looking at these seeping out or foreign central banks\nAnd looking at what they're doing um you know if if we get a little bit more to others policy or guidance out if you see the the OJ\nThe negative side covered to continue tightening race and continue to shrink pathology um so it's really about global central bank flows I'm In how they impact on the capital markets you know I think if this is a healthy pull back\nUm you know will start to see will start to the volatility probably remain elevated from where it was in the middle part of the year but it's still probably stay a little certainly below where it is today I think you know one thing that I'm looking at today as I you know sort of look at my screen here we've got\nTheir tender ... down modesty thirty year old Don modesty I'm from where I work where they were\nSo many he'll down just to tell our listeners so the yield down as we're having this conversation which means the value of bonds around it's like a ... that's\n... and so today and that that same time the market is down and hence we now don't have that parity that same thing happening between stocks and bonds right ones eggs with you and say well the big down day that didn't happen those were down and today we're getting a little bit more normalcy\nYeah we're getting a little more normalcy today and I think that's really a function of you know just the ripple effect of yesterday working through you know that the hedge funds and you know global awesome having just run the world to know the repositioning right and I think I think some might be taking some risk off the table so maybe\nYou know investing where they see opportunities and so we're I think we're seeing a lot of portfolio shoveling today um but we're not seeing is the fear from Wednesday carry over into Thursday and which is good I'm\nIn a way that's manifesting such that people are sort of having a dash for cash right [noise] um you mentioned earlier about you know sort of the the financial media and you know I think it's you know it's a it's an astute point I think you know we live in a soundbite headlining tour going you know sort of culture now um\nWere sort of everybody's you know or you know we we can we can look at breaking news on CNBC or or Bloomberg twenty four seven [noise] um and I think in some respects that you know that they're doing their job of trying to trying to get eyeballs to to you know to tune in [noise] but um you know with investors have to really rely on is\nYou know they've had conversations with their with their advisors on sort of what their financial goals are right and I think the\nThe objective of their portfolio\nIs to achieve those goals but\nIt's been structured that takes an instruction to take into consideration these anomalies these outliers sort of events that we see on you know on a day like Wednesday\nI'm you know we don't expect obviously you know to see continued um you know about some risk aversion to the end of the year we expect to it you know markets to stabilize a little bit until if investors were to you know sell out of their positions today we you know they did brisk\nSelling at the bottom so I think one thing to keep in mind that I always remind\nYou know friends and family is generally the largest single um games in markets are you know peppered in around the largest down days as well so it's incredibly hard time to markets because you have to do it twice you got to know when to get out you got to know when they get back on [laughter] um so I I really recommend that uh that\nReally you know your clients investors to stay focused and and here to a disciplined um portfolios allocation strategy also how to discipline rebound some strategy you have\nA great advice or the proper is my guest he's a C. essay and he is with the new Snyder they guide our investment team ... financial network in\nA navigating us through the world does investment stocks bonds cash alternative investments and helped\nManage money for a for clients people just like you see would you say that some of the data now that the research reports of then coming out this past week with this sell off I'm going to find as a sellout is that the market now here in the U.S the the at least could be in that range of potentially\nA value or cheat comparatively\n[noise] um you know I'm I'm hesitant to call the cheap um you know um but\nYeah we do see we do see relative valuations have improved a bit under so often I think when we drill down below the surface a little bit we looked at the delineation between value and girls we see that\nYou know growth has outpaced value for a long period of time and I think it's not a surprise Bennett down markets investors are looking at what they hold and I'm starting to be I think a little bit more maybe thoughtful around\nTheir risk exposures and you know in that sense I think value can look relatively more attractive than growth but there's certainly still I'm thrilled to value opportunities are nationally as well\nA good okay so between between international and us as a result of the sell off where where would you say the better opportunity lies\nLooking for a long term investors international stocks um are are really good um so he could offer really good opportunities here um you know we look at what we can really not just you know the big familiar household names but we think about\nThose countries that are contributing most to the growth of world GDP than if it makes sense to have an exposure to those countries of course I'm thinking about China and emerging markets um\nYou know we we would expect that\nYou know as the ... those those countries that are contributing the most annual GDP Growth we would expect intuitively to recruit some gains from that growth\nUm either you know from a stronger capital investment cycle and or you know a earnings grow right so I think that for a long term investor international in emerging markets make a lot of sense out in the short term though I Would expect that we reached the a little bit more volatility over the next six to nine months to come to you have to remember that [laughter]\nYou know evaluations are are are are long term play in the short term is a lot of noise that investors have to be comfortable you know really wading through automated right now the noise of emerging markets and international stocks as the u._s. dollars starting and then uh you know trade tensions in trade negotiations\nGot it got it I think that's a ... lots of questions we have in our mailbag ask Steve that's the essence land a communist state and play in the ... coming in this week um some technical some pretty basic but they're you know I'm going to help you know how do you help me answer any things in this a value driven correction\nIs it technical based on valuations or is there something potentially systemic wrong\nThat's causing the markets all\nI you know I mean I think valuations have gotten a little bit stretched but I think I think that I don't think fell off his just because valuation self have gotten a little bit stretched though I think that what we're seeing is a little bit of risk aversion from you know as we talked earlier a little bit about the tightening of interest\nDish and so you know it could be it could be you know not to stomach and a sense of like a two thousand they talking situation but it could it could take a little while to to work out we'll just you know we're sort of in a wait and see approach with how fed policymakers react\nDo we see any problems in the credit space and the reason why I say that is because as this whole thing was going down I was looking at at\nWhere there could be a bigger issue lying and much of that has to do with debt right so when there's there's massive debt and you get pulled back and then people have to cover debt that is when you get that kind of piling on and that crashed\nSo what I Want to do is give you an idea of where maybe some of the confidence comes from to do that bind\nWith regards to the day to day operations when you're handling a financial plan for someone and maybe it's someone like you who might be thinking about retirement and the next year or two where maybe someone\nLike you who might be retired who says gee you know I Need to keep the money in the market because\nI keep hearing I'm going to need the gross and to have a good balanced\nPlan I Need to have a mix of different assets but it makes me scared and it makes me not feel real good when things go down and rightly so where does the confidence come from and where are we in buying to help keep that investment plan on its long term track\nBoth the confidence comes in looking at really what's happening in trying to get to the why why is this happening meaning a pullback of substantial numbers like a five percent are down eight hundred points on the market\nAnd we're talking us markets then you look over and and get the broader picture you see the overseas markets down and the past week had sort of an anomaly were bonds were down to because normally bonds will go up when equities really self heavy\nThat didn't seem to happen with so both areas so off and so whenever you see something unusual and an anomaly that you don't see very often\nYou sort of look at it and try to pay attention and for me I tend to go to\nMany although I feel season now but I'm In my fifties and they've been doing investment management helping people navigate investment plans for over twenty five years\nI go to those have been doing it longer than me that had been out there and they're on trading desk they are not the folks that talked to individual clients day in and day out these are are ones that are kind of in the trenches they sit on the desks doing the trading activity buildings strategies\nAnd I tend to go to them and I try to get some color of\nWhat's happening give me your take on it\nAnd in my back pocket I have my network right critical financial network my network of folks that I'd like to reach out to and get their season expertise on what's going on it's kinda like sports you know sports teams will bring in a player that doesn't run as fast as everybody else and not going to be a game changer in the game\nBut guess what great individual who can sit and talk to the game and talk to the bench and get the players heads in the right place and give them some of their expertise even though they might not be able to be as quickly may have lost the step but\nThe knowledge the wisdom is there so I go to that brain trust the group of wisdom thinkers that I've gone to over my career I look for input I look for feedback\nI got the doom and gloom ers who are always doom and gloom I have the optimist who are always optimist market's going up\nBut in times like this you still talk to both sides\nAnd then you come up with your own conclusions like I Do and my conclusion is that this was of value driven correction by the end of the day it was technical and it was not a panic situation I looked there are no credit quality issues meaning that there might not be liquidity in the system can we support\nTransactions and Ken Money flow freely we weren't seeing that although stay with me because there is one little thing that got me\n... it's got me still thinking a lot and up a little bit at night but I'll share that with you in a moment I looked at the high yield market because sometimes the riskier companies and you know you start to get bankruptcies defaults and then you know they need some bailout 'cause there's money tied into with that\nMoney that other investors have that might want their money out of it and you're constantly looking for what's going to cause a domino effect and the high yield bond market the junk bond market looks very good actually looks the best it's ever had in history there are only predicting about two percent the phone so there was something going on funky in those types of markets\nBottom line is the fundamental so strong we have an economy that's good we have inflation in check\nIs the fed being a little bit aggressive says some would argue yes some would say we need it could be the fed that triggered this summer saying yes because they can't really see much of anything else out there that would have caused this and the feds were the one that reacted to what looks like an economy that's heating up\nDoesn't look like we're in a recession doesn't look like we have a credit crisis we're just having a pull back\nI don't see structural issues inflation in check as I said we have a global economy even with terrorists what is China's gonna do honestly they just want to keep the\nBillion plus from picking up pitchforks and going after the amber so low priced things accordingly just to keep it off comfort there\nThe U.S will get its windfall of tariffs tax maybe that'll help pay down some deficit the bottom line is all of a sudden we're hearing noise that maybe the markets cheap\nBecause the S. and P. hit that twenty seven hundred number\nI'm hearing somebody say that George Soros hit a button mid term elections coming up and they don't want\nThe Republicans to take any credit for a good economy so if they can overshadow the economy and the new tax structure in the system with a market that has hurt people's wallet George Soros hit the button again I don't have anything to go on to say\nWe saw that happen what's wrong with just the market's\nDoing what a are you ready for this a healthy market can do\nAnd that is\nPull back from time to time sometimes you just have to break it down to a pretty simple stuff the way I kind of look at this trying to understand markets and how they move and groove and react\nWe can't control any of it is zero of it the best we can do to control it is to diversify so that we spread the risk out so that one particular aspect class doesn't get us and that tends to be what happens it's\nMaybe one asset class and I look at each asset class and say could there be a problem with this asset class like high yield bond or treasuries\nOr us large kept stocks blue chips whatever it might be but a market when you're looking at it as a whole is sort of like growing new seedlings tree that you hope for the next twenty five years becomes wonderfully ballooned in your front yard\nThe tree that maybe the kids will climb on them when the grand kids come do you know you'll put swing in it\nBut you have to prove that from time to time you have to bring it back\nTo let it go forward pull it\nBack trim it back the way the market works\nAnd without good pulling back and trimming it gets out of control so that might have been what happened here but\nI'm going to share with you something else that I'm keeping an eye on as I promised I'm going to take a quick break I'm going to come back and share with you something that happened this past week that involve vanguard\nAnd some activity going on at vanguard where\nDuring the market drop band guards website it's computer system froze and they're saying that left some clients with no website access I Want to get into that because vanguard has\nAn enormous amount of money that has been flowing in\nTo something called E. T. S. exchange traded funds so when I talk about liquidity and being able to have money flow so that markets can operate without blockage\nThere is some concern that the huge growth in the last few years within the E. T. S. within vanguard could be causing some liquidity problems I'm gonna share that with you talk a little bit about it and\nWe're going to be looking deeper into it [noise]\nAnd I think more news will come out on it but I think it's worth me sharing with you again go financial network big enough to deliver small enough to care and have that in just a moment [noise]\nFollowing a true story my name is David Bryant when I was thirty seven\nMy wife and I decided to get term life insurance through select quote\nFor years later I was diagnosed with ... also known as Lou Gehrig's disease because of life insurance the people I Love most in this world will be protected no matter what happens to me I Know that the dreams I have for my family can still come true financial security to stay in the home we became a family in and for our children to be able to go to college\nI reached out to select quote because I wanted to share my story is just one person purchases life insurance I Know I Will have made a difference to let go\nConfined to thirty seven year old male of five hundred thousand dollar policy front or a dollar a day\nIf there are people you care about any life insurance it may be the single most important financial decision of your life\nDon't put on protecting your family or your frequent mountain college hundred six seven one Seventy Seventy eight hundred six seven to one Seventy Seventy eight hundred six seven to one Seventy seven income or go to select quote unconscious dissipate endorsement get full details on the ... the political dot com slash commercials not available in all states [noise]\nDid you know the average person's face about one third of their lives sleeping Hi I'm Gary ... volt being a prize is complete home renovations and here's how we can help you sleep better\nBetter knowing your roof starting were windows were installed my vote be certified cruise sleep better knowing volt they can provide flexible painted planes to make your project affordable better knowing that since Nineteen Seventy feet or to professionals people depend on\nSleep better knowing volt they provide a lifetime guarantee on our production work on ships\nWe know on average how many people are gonna want their money how much money is coming in and and we can manage accordingly that's sufficient sees and keeping those efficiencies but when you get something like this big sell off the question that summer speculating is could they do it efficiently\nAnd was there some type of glitch to the system to slow down velocity I don't know glue conspiracy theory hopefully it's not to weigh over your head but I'm just trying to share with you what goes on in a world of somebody who was helping people plan for the future\nWho puts together plans retirement plans\nLife plans were there as investments that are part of the success of that plan and what we need to keep an eye on as the world changes as more money flows through the system\nAnd more people are relying on investments and bonds and stocks\nGlobally domestically for their wellbeing [noise]\nAnd the growth of their money over time will share more I'd love to hear what you have to say [noise] sent me an email ...

president because the president is basically pointing his finger at who he thinks is the problem with the market so off\nOr I Want to get into that and as you know I've been asking you to send me your input\nOf what you think about the topics we covered on today's show share with me what you think about ATF share with me what you think about the market pull back healthy thing is that going to be good longer term for everyone who are investors share with me what you think I'm gonna share with the with Donald Trump thinks he's blaming the fed [laughter] it's interesting because\nWhen he nominated the fed chair\nA he had some interesting things to say so when president Donald Trump praised Jerome Powell as a strong committed and smart last year when he nominated the former banker to lead the Federal Reserve that's a big difference in where today now the president apparently things Powell is a dangerous lunatic\nAn extraordinary series of attacks this week Trump called the fed crazy loco and said it's gone wild with interest rate hikes\nAnd he blamed the central bank in part for wins they sharp decline in the market so he's on record as saying this whole thing is being caused by the fed and there are bunch quacks and cooks let me hold my tongue because I think I've said that in years past the president it's not just nominated the chair\nOf the fed but he's also filled many seats on the fed that have not been filled in years so he's shaped this fed by appointment but the fed up parades independently look I'm not a big fan of the fed I don't think they'd get it right usually I don't think they allow the markets operate freely\nWhich is an issue I have but that's my issue\nThe president has has issue so the president kept up the assault on Thursday came out and said I think the fed out of control he told reporters that stocks jai rated after Wednesday's tumble more than three percent I think I Know about it better than it than they do Trump said he expressed disappointment with Powell but said he would not fire him\nSomething he lacks\nIn authority to do anyway Brian extreme circumstances or the fed ex president campfire\nHeaded fat you'd probably create enough aggravation for and make them want to quit but maybe that's what's going on but\nWe know what this is Trump is getting out in front of this thing\nTo market pull back he can go on and say it's a market pull back where he can look at somebody to point the finger to\nKnowing that elections are coming up so in the process of attacking the fed and such a manner Trump has\nKind of alarm senior advisors and force them into this kind of public walk back\nAnd he's a little bit unnerved market watchers and former government officials who fear the sharp broadside could undermine the feds longstanding role as a politically neutral arbiter of interest rate policy\nCharged with making tough decisions with a focus on long term interest of the U.S economy look we can go back into the history I I Love the fact that he's smack in the fed around a little\nBit keep on their toes I've\nDone it myself you know they often boggled my mind on some of the logic that they operate under now with others have to say\nWell Larry Summers the coin Trump's raise cook the president is wrong obviously and his judgment about the fed that's Larry Summers gotta remember he's the guy who ran Harvard number that the Facebook\nScandal that went on and whether it's soccer Berg really owned it or the two Winkle vast brothers\nWell Larry Summers was the guy who was running Harvard at the time he was also former treasury secretary an economic advisor to President Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and\nHe says look there's room to debate about the precise posture monetary policy but the suggestion that there is something crazy about the Fed's decision is absurd to disagree with their former fed chair summer say why can't anybody in authority question said needs to be questioned and some would argue what's the logic\nIf the set I said it a few weeks ago on the radio and on a pod cast if the fed looks at growth and to present in two thousand and Nineteen\nWhy are they raising interest rates so I think the president's onto something here and he's not going to go lightly and if it looks like there's pain and damage being done and it's being caused from some direction like maybe a\nQuick joke in interest rates are going beyond what's necessary and an interest rate hike\nHe's going to say it like it is the president that's the president we have to sit back and join the popcorn and watch the show because I'm sure there's going to be more to come as we try to get to the point of whether we're in a good economy a good market a\nHealthy market that is just going through a healthy pull back or we're going to a market that has got some type of manipulation to it or somebody trying to undermine some bigger things that might be coming down the road like elections what do

gonna talk about hair skin and nails and you know as we age often we're having trouble with our hair skin or nails and often all it's available to us is some kind of college and product\nWhen we're already over eating protein [laughter] so\nThat doesn't make any sense as an answer\nWhat we really need is something that gives them missing ingredient and the missing ingredient is a soluble eyes form of carrot and then we derive that from shapes will it's got some really great studies showing that\nIt's an important structural protein and that it really delivers the goods it effectively support skin moisture\nElasticity and compact ... as well as overall hair and nail health and string wow\nAnd you know most products as I said earlier are from chicken college in well\nLittle if any help because we're already getting so much protein as a nation typically most people need to cut down because they're not doing enough physical activity to ... to um deserve or for the body to use that much protein\nAnd you know as we age the skin thins the hair and nails have increasing difficulty in getting this carrot and they need and that's because it's got to go through the liver and you guys are reading too much of those refined oils\nAnd that's the thing we want to really get a lid on that supposedly heart healthy olive oil coconut oil all ... and of course ... oil and the and the other oils anytime they press out an oil you got a problem so\nOur goal is to cut those down at the same time you support their hair skin and ... and\nJust won five hundred milligrams capsule per day is going to be all you need if you're under a hundred two hundred pounds and if you're over two hundred pounds you got to use it leads to capsules and if you're in a hurry to good idea to use to capsules for\nMaybe a month or so and then cut back to one capsule and so of course our hair skin and nails are going to be on special today say goodbye to get twenty five percent off each and we're going to cover many other things that you can do\nTo support the skin including dealing with blemishes non cystic acme\nSo uh we'll cover more of that right now we're gonna go and begin answering your nutrition and health related questions let's go to Delia in Oregon\nAnd she's got some questions about heavy metal go right ahead Delia\nYeah I'd like to try and find out what you have to be a little heavy metal may add body well\nHeavy metals ... there's three steps to dealing with heavy metals\nThe first step is to stop being exposed the best you can and one of my favorite things to do that is a calcium aluminum silly Kate clay\nUnlike the clays that are out there typically they're mostly sodium\nThis guy can trap up to Ninety eight percent of all the weird things that can be in food from insecticides pesticides all manner of junk and so we called is I'm dragging clans LAX\nAnd you would take to capsules an empty it into a cup with about six eight ounces of water\nAnd you want to drink that while you eat your main meal and what this does is it transit the intestinal tract and it traps all of these guys that normally would attach to calcium bonding sites for all the toxins it never leaves the intestine\nIt's just the ideal first step\nWhen you're detox seeing the body okay the next step is to do mild things don't remember I said this zero you got to stop exposure so for you Delia that could mean that you um have silver filling in your mouth you have silver fillings\nAll right then and then you have them removed okay so now you have white stuff\nOK okay well the white stuff sadly excrete aluminum so you still have problems so the clay is going to be very helpful there and also will want to do something to minimize your exposure there what I Would recommend is that you leave those feelings in place\nAnd you have them carries died stained every six months when you have your teeth cleaned\nAnd the ones that fail you want to replace them with low fusing ceramic\nSo you'll need to look around in your area\nTo find someone who can do this work you can always call a cue or a practitioner usually they work with a dentist and they'll be able to tell you you can also look in the yellow pages and for a dentist who says he has a machine called ...\nC A R E C where they are able to mill a block of low fusing ceramic literally identical to your own truth\nChair side so with only a single in as the decision they can replace a an in lay on late or crown\nAnd that is twenty first century dentistry so we need to deal with that our next favorite thing for promoting the health of the body and detoxification would be Mehdi ...\nThat is a very gentle\nForm of ... instead of being full garrick\n... Kenny on a and it really seems to be a wonderful a help in what you would want is to just maybe take one per day so that it's mild and very easy it doesn't push too hard on the body [noise]\nAnd there are even stronger things but if we were to use those I think what you should do is be visiting with a cure a practitioner because they can test you make sure it's not too much for you\nAnd make sure that you have the right dose and of course during this whole process you want to do your best\nBy measuring the first morning here in the age you want to do your best\nTo keep that as close as you can

having a drink a lot of water it'll stop but they don't want\nThat fact to what they are going\nTo digest oh okay\nSo now the with the age sale if he has any negative reaction you may have to stop get some stomach support\nAnd have him make a T beforehand or with two capsules and you can do that before each main meal and then the digest NHL work perfectly until you have time to visit with someone who knows cure and they can\nFind that the interference field ... stomach\nPacket and then you will need stomach support any more\nWell is a male and as a approaching late late fifties probably early

sure and matter of fact he told me what his position told him I say and um\nI Would just you know well it's probably 'cause he was a he did a lot of a hard hard ...\nWell you certainly would not be hurt by trying something like liver support and or if you know how much does the guy way you\nKnow how a hundred hundred and sixty one ... one sixty five and one eighty so long and\nSo I Would probably want to use about six per meal\nAnd see if this isn't a big help but you know a lot of times the abdominal this tension is nothing more than ... years of not being able to digest the food now so if he got on some quantum Dodgers maybe it takes two of those when he eats a meal at the start of the meal on the end of the meal [noise]\nHe would take may be for um detain had to call right now he's digesting or like you did in his twenties so delivers not having to endure rotting food\nAnd that along with delivers support might help him it's certainly worth a try to see if it'll give them a

which can trap a lot of the bad players that are in our food in her ever escalating in our food called pops\nPersistent organic pollutants is to jump on some dragging Clinton's elects um we used to call it dragging Clinton's detox same product and this guy you know just take one or two capsules empty ... six eight ounces of water\nMix it in drink that Wylie you eat and when you do this it can has the ability to mind up to about Ninety percent of all the toxins in food\nSo it can give your liver little holiday and reduce the tremendous load and as it's taken with your food and transits the got with your food as these chemicals are liberated it can trap them because it has this extraordinary affinity for die cup Arnold structures\nAnd donates calcium and nothing else leaves the clay\nSo

with them\nSo just give a ... eight hundred three Seventy four thirty four\nForty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven [laughter] All right let's go right back to the phones let's go to\nRobert in Brentwood, Tennessee and he's wondering how magnesium might relate to bow\nRegularity and his trouble sleeping okay or are you there Robert affair and how old man are you know how much the way\nI'm sixty six one eighty seven on eighty six\nOkay and when you when you have difficulty going off to sleep or staying asleep or what what's the trouble was sleeping\nYet so I I'm actually I had a a lot of weight loss very rapidly and that's what I see\nAnd then I'm Sorry I lost weight and I'm a doctor tells me at a certain amount of calories and call I Try to eat meat so proteins and ... but I Need the vegetables because I was just the most you know\nAbsolutely need the both but I Can't eat the tiny enough vegetables that doesn't mean I Can't even I Can't eat that much [laughter] okay so you're not sleeping all at night so\nBut what about the ... let's get back to sleeping do you have difficulty going off the sleepers day as like\nOh OK off and say okay good I got it All right well see the off to sleep is usually linked to the gall bladder\nSo we'd want to support gall bladder and your body size maybe three teaspoons of gall bladder PG usually the first night you observe you can go off to sleep easier okay\nI'll show and this you would use for months and uh after you have used it three weeks you would begin to coffee and them as per week\nNothing will give you more beautiful here and skin that\nWill just do wonders for you and that lasts for Thirteen weeks that's going to take care of going off to sleep now staying asleep is typically if you're waking up like for no reason not where are you waking up to urinate or you're waking up for no reason\nUm most of the time as you're in\nOkay well then we should support that so let's go with um the polling the floor\nAnd see if we can't get you and your body size about oh three per meal and I do that for three weeks and at the end of the time you'd probably find you're not getting up at all and then you can cut to two at breakfast only okay\nThen the other thing we've gotta do to make sure that it's not rotting food that's waking you up is to get you on digestive support and ... so maybe to quantum died just at the start of the main meal and then the end of the meal about four\nTo five the pain hydro chloride now you're dead just seem more like you did as a twenty year old\nSo now I think this should be a tremendous help the lack of sleep will cause you to excrete magnesium which can tend to make the intestines and the vows much harder so you could jump on some of our magnesium four hundred\nAnd take a couple of teaspoons a morning and night for probably five days and now you should start having very easy to pass foul movements and then I Would cut two um two teaspoons am only okay\nAnd I think that you're doing this job for you a lot of people tell me your age so that they prefer teaspoon morning and night rather than taking it all at once in the day because you're still screening till we rebuild those adrenal 's okay [noise] I Hope that's a big help for you and your", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Philadelphia",
