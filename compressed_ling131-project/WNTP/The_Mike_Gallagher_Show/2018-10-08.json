you can do now is breathe a sigh of relief and say\nA good we got this major battle one we don't need to go to the polls\nIn a few weeks we can stay home that's the last thing you can do\nAnd I I it's really weird I've been thinking a lot about Roseanne Barr over the last couple of days because it says yes for the first time there was a push back\nTo the left demand that somebody had to be on a platter\nOver something but in this case wasn't corroborate first time this has happened I mean normally careers are gone lives are destroyed people's lives are away into the darkness never to be heard from again this time Brett Kavanaugh fought back\nThis time Republicans were unified on the political front we witnessed a unification within the Republican Party than we haven't seen it a couple of years or more\nAnd I was thinking about how somebody can be destroyed over something like a tweet\nAnd you know at the end of the day may be may be\nThe push back on behalf of judge Kavanaugh and the Republicans deciding no we're not going to destroy this man over this one accusation\nI Know there were a couple but the the first one was the one that was deemed credible you noticed the you hear the Republicans who read the FBI report the word credible was used for Dr Ford she's seem credible is what all of them said\nHey just wasn't corroborated so you couldn't\nEver ever take him down over her testimony alone\n\nA couple of times I've seen some references to Roseanne Barr evidently that show that she created and return to is going to be back\nI don't think it's returned yet to the IRS next week or this week they're going to call it the Connors and they apparently killed off Roseanne all because of her tweet about Valerie Jarrett and it was make no mistake it was a terrible sweet\nBut it was a tweet one tweet and her lifetime of work were suddenly consumed by the fire of the range machine PS she's a Trump supporter\n\nI saw over the weekend there was a a an NBC reporter I Believe a young NBC reporter who a few years ago\nWrote a bunch of homophobic tweaks will happen to her no she's a liberal NBC reporter Roseanne and you re tweet or\nTweet out a

listening and I'm watching this thing\nProgress and I'm thinking by guy she's going to get this and I was really negative\nBecause we're in a culture now the mindset is the the meat to activists many of them said accusation made accusation believe if you believe the accusation that means you have to condemn the accused\nThats the formula although I Will say and I'd like to find the lambs or the audio clip from Tijuana Burke who's the founder of the me too movement from years ago this is not this was a woman an activist who started this a long time ago\nIt's just now gotten kind of a resurgence with the Harvey Weinstein and stuff she said I'm On meet the press yesterday I Believe the woman doesn't mean don't have an investigation\nShe said it never meant you believe the woman you stop there and you ruined the person's life she said believe the woman means you listen to the woman you believe that nobody is probably going to come forward and make an accusation but you have to get an investigation you have to corroborate and I was ... I was really relieved to hear her say that\nShe after all was the woman who founded this whole me too movement\nAnd that's what happened with Brett Kavanaugh there was an investigation seven one actually I saw senator on TV over the weekend forget which one who said yeah there have been a hundred and fifty witnesses\nOver the course of the investigations into Brett Kavanaugh's past not one of
