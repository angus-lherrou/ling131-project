happen November districts you better could check this out of my life dot com with your by computer you don't want to watch this and listen to this enjoy\nWe have a poll out of Pennsylvania this is a brand new poll that came out a couple of hours ago NBC News marathon will look at\nA double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania hardly the first double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania this is the third one we've seen in a week for her so Donald Trump Pennsylvania is a big target but all the evidence we have right now says Pennsylvania is still favored to be a democratic state\nIn the shoes a actually a peanut projecting that don't just won the state of Pennsylvania and I know for for Hillary Clinton [noise]\nWhat about Ohio we have a brand new part of Ohio Donald Trump doing a little better here but he's still down in Ohio a five point gap so again right now Donald Trump targeting Ohio just like he targeting Pennsylvania but he's not there right now Clinton still waiting in Ohio\n[laughter] major production right now\nDonald Trump will say oh\nAnother one brand new NBC Marist Poll out of Iowa today again a little bit closer but a four point lead for Hillary Clinton basically supposed to be a light target for Donald Trump he added convention each had chances here he was out there in that for the caucuses early this year he is still trailing in this poll in Iowa closer\nHe could turn it around but again for right now is Donald Trump ahead in Iowa not in this poll\nProjects Donald Trump will win the state of Iowa\nWe don't have new polls today but Wisconsin Michigan these or other states Donald Trump is talked about living with the rust belt strategy we have not seen a poll that puts him ahead nice state\nFair and our projects that Donald Trump sharing this with Dr electoral votes you\nKnow again the boat and it's still on Donald Trump to show that he can do something Mitt Romney in a whole bunch of other Republicans over the last generation or so couldn't do and that is actually when the state that's the first thing that's going wrong for Trump the bigger problem is this though these are the blue states he thinks he can flip\nHow about the red state he needs to hold how about the state's Rodney one in twenty twelve the Trump maybe it's just assuming he's been a whole will check this out\nBrand new numbers out of North Carolina North Carolina\nWas Mitt Romney state in twenty twelve well right now in this poll Hillary Clinton has the week very close certainly Donald Trump could still win it I called a tossup states but we have seen polls putting Hillary Clinton ahead there it is possible Hillary Clinton could end up flipping North Carolina making it a blue state\nOf another state or a jacket as I said I watch a lot of big data ... say its owner Donald Trump sixteen electrodes\nTrump problem no gets a lot worse\nThan North Carolina look at this Georgia new poll seven point lead here for Hillary Clinton not the first poll that we've seen putting her head and Georgia this the state the last one democratic back in Nineteen Ninety two again Donald Trump could still take Georgia but Hillary Clinton certainly had the chance to flip Georgia\nFactory in an art project for Donald Trump will carry the state of Georgia [noise] but if\nHillary Clinton could sustain the kind we see as we've gotten into it into this race you could see other state that suddenly get crazy states you wouldn't have been imagine like South Carolina even attaches they could at least\nBecome competitive and what it would mean doesn't mean Hillary Clinton's going to win all the it means we could have more competitive states than we ever imagined do you\nThink with these with South Carolina and Kansas you would think there would be not just likely about likely slash slam dunk slash and guaranteed slash obviously this is ruby red South Carolina and Kansas but instead they're like read there just lean Republican now ... South Carolina\nLean Republican\nState of South Carolina has gone Republican [noise]\nLean Republican Donald Trump for we project will win Kansas with six electoral votes\nAnd if that was on the top states they can do the math associated with all the electoral votes from all the states that they go that way you have to lean Republican and the likely Republican go read and the lean Democrat and likely Democrat and go blue [noise]\nSigned those out that way and then they say that\nDonald Trump has the best day in the entire world completely out of harm's expectation and he wins tossup states he wins\nStates electoral college vote in\nThe days after she went to all of the top so to be insane because nobody when all of the top states [noise] even if Donald Trump dead when all of the top states they would stillness\nPartially or even with the best intentions it's hard\nI mean in terms of what's going on up there is only five states that are still considered a toss up right now Florida\n\nI figured I projects Donald Trump will carry the state of Florida\nProjects Donald Trump will win the state of Iowa was it six electoral votes [noise]\nUnderestimate the good citizens of Gotham City she [noise] but\nAnd the Democratic calling us harm but this is a real calling from this is legit methodology\nSmart politicians trust voters not opposed to saying\nCrushed some Wilker standing by Clinton that corner\nWhat we now Ryan have had it over here again about that if I hadn't really drawn are\nThere is only the first of all they come in I mean they were looking for any sign that there was some\nHealth isn't it out of her pain in the crowd is now really finally they playing and then we hear what happened\nI never would have believed that the polls could be wrong about other candidates who trusted too much of the polls Marilyn said and they found out that it's the boats that come\nSo many of them are supporters are reacting or something like a campaign hell yeah come on and paying go home when I was saying how can I ask are five races that are either too early callers\n[laughter] don't mind if people are basically robbing they're merely reacting to their surroundings\n[noise] or no Trump [noise] twenty eight or nine [noise]\n\nShort overtures already and that's why there aren't you are\nClinton campaign Kristen [noise]\nNow confirmed that Secretary Clinton has conceded\nDonald Trump had concussion took place in us so we call a we anticipate just a moment ago [noise] uh and as we are waiting Donald Trump taking this dance here that is the news at this hour Secretary Clinton has seeded Donald Trump\nYou missed the cornerstone of our mission we must abide by\nGosh we put it that way that men\nCan I help and agree even if Donald Trump dead when all of them have said that he would still is ah\nNow reject the winner of the presidential race in that project Donald Trump wins\nDonald Trump elected president of the United states [noise]\nExperience teaches slowly around [noise]\nThe cost of many mistakes babies\nAt names and shocking development particularly for her reporters who waited hours here at the job is to hear from her when it appeared as though the path was cutting too difficult\nNumber of broke out into tears started leaving early we started to set in one of her supporters told me this is a political upset she's pushing holding the line\nHere because we have an ... something that she was hoping for more than I can make for them to be again\nEnd of the Democratic calling us harm but that doesn't ... calling from this is legit methodology\nSelections are not won by pose commissioner or one by votes at least in this country [noise]\nYou're not having a terrible terrible train also you're not dead and you haven't gone to how\nHas your life out this is our election now this is talk on track\nNovember sex jerk and went on your calendar and vote [noise]\nHe was ... million Ninety more intelligent conservative Darren [noise]\nBreaking news or the breakneck pace says he's do Mike Gallagher show\nWe're not going to make America great again it was never that story\nWe we've got a\nCrucial midterm election coming up in November ...\nNineteen Seventy eight ... voice of clarity for millions of America\nThose old kicked off\nWas his new Democratic Party if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house and the words of Clinton's ... start\nShowing owned by the most famous man on a plane and you've been ...\nIf I can I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studios might like\n[noise] I Believe he is best efforts there have been a lot of victory for the Republicans over the last couple of weeks it's sort of started\nWith the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh despite every effort to stop him to for him to derail his confirmation it happened it happened and people were just amazed\nAnd then of course there have been a lot of economic ... bits of news to keep coming out about the economy we had a couple of we had to defend the Dow for a couple of days it bounced back the economy continues to surge and shore\nAnd there'd been political victories um yesterday a judge\nThrew out Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against President Trump had to do with one of his tweets and more and more importantly the judge ordered Stormy Daniels\nYou know the porn lawyer represented by Michael ... to pay President Trump's legal fees are real slap in the face I'm\n... and then came this weird revelation by Senator Elizabeth Warren good she barely has any Native American ancestry in her heritage\nWhich of course has set President Trump into this cascading you know euphoria of mocking and taunting her even more than ever turns out she's got one\nOne thousand in twenty fourth Native American ancestry in her in her blood line and most Americans have more Native American ancestry than she does\nIt's been a ton it's been a scam and she has thoroughly embarrassed yourself and everybody's used to be having a field day with it well all of these things if you add them up\nIt's ... you know all roads lead to November sex we keep getting closer and closer to a midterm election with victory after victory after a victory for Republicans but I don't know what's gonna happen I don't I don't I have absolutely no crystal ball\nWe should know not to try to make a prediction there are lots of toss ups in the house races\nAnd uh we we should have learned\nWe should have learned from September from November of twenty sixteen not to believe the polls we should learn not to ... and and what I see these this binary choice that is before Americans\nAt a party represented by people like Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal I put them both together\nThis is this is a a lie that they've perpetuated in order to impress people\nIn Elizabeth Warren's case it was to get advancement at Harvard by calling herself a Native American and Richard Blumenthal case it was doing press people as as as if he was some kind of a war hero\nIt's called stolen valor when you lie about serving your country\nNow again this was represented by the Democrat Party\nIt this is a party that is angry and violent I was reading about Tucker Carlson who uh we hope to have on the show next week I enjoy your show\nJust about every night I don't know Tucker in fact all the years I've spent as a Fox News contributor bypass never I've never really cross paths with Tucker um he's got a new book that's number one on the New York times best seller lists\nAnd he said it in a in an interview he gave to the national review podcast this week that so many people curse him out in public when he goes out to dine in restaurants that he can't go out to eat anymore he doesn't go to restaurants\nHe told the national review podcast having someone scream FU at a restaurant it just wrecked your rex your meal he says he can't go to restaurants anymore in Washington DC was he because he continually get yelled at\nBy other diners who shout curse words in him that those are\nDemocrats that's the way Democrats are acting\nAnd when I look at a race like the one between beta or work in taxes are actually Robert O'Rourke in Texas and Ted Cruz\nYou you gotta you gotta guy on a skateboard versus a grown up a constitutional conservative this cannot be a tough call protects and your story after story north south east and west where the choice is so easy it's not even if the shouldn't even be a close call\nNow the deck is stacked against the Republican Party because in off year elections the party in control usually suffers of defeat I don't think that's going to happen this year I just don't I think we're going to see some good good news and [laughter]\n... there was one thing cannot help\nI just I just want to be able to salute hit a variety of ways what's a musical tribute real Native Americans like Charles ... junior I Want you to hear what he said uh representing Cherokee Nation he was on CNN last night with Jake Tapper\nAnd ... you know Pocahontas is now bragging about this weird\nRevelation that she has one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American heritage and shot task and junior push back last night from Cherokee Nation in a big way here's a clip cup cut number three from CNN and our friends over at gravy\nAnd the problem with the DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation a member of an Indian nation\nDNA at best can give you some indicators of some markers and that to indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have lived there in North and South America may have been a native peoples of those continents [noise]\nUm it's irrelevant to what it means to me a Native American in this country that that the base that's based on legal definition certainly every tribe has that in common that we have some legal basis for citizenship that\nWe determined consistent with federal trainees\nHis holy unhelpful for any national later to a claim to DNA to determine a artist tablet set their Native American in this country\nThis is this is all good news for Republicans because we are just a couple of weeks away from the mid term election the president wasted no time in responded in responding or very forcefully here are some of his tweets he said poke a hunter or they I mean the tweets are\nClassic you know they call the limousine that the president rides in that big\nStretch Cadillac limousine\nThe nickname forward is the beast\nThe nickname for Donald Trump ought to be the beast because these tweets the man is just but he's an animal I mean he is just hysterical here his tweets today\nThank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas here's a complete and total fraud many tweeted now that her claims are being of Indian heritage urban have turned out to be a scam and ally\nElizabeth Warren's should apologize for ... for pepper for perpetrating there's fraud against the American people\nHarvard called her a person of color\nAmazing con he puts in parentheses\nAnd would not have taken her otherwise\nAnd then he tweeted Pocahontas the bad version\nSometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her\nQuote DNA test is useless even they don't want her\nThere's been warned story [noise] going up in a way to handle it being a bonfire of blaming lies\nAnd why she would release this a couple of weeks before the midterms is amazing I think this
