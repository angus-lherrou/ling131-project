they can't believe they didn't shut him down they can't believe some of these poll numbers and their expression it in ways\nThat really reveal who they are Hillary Clinton for example\nA it was announced that bill and Hillary like a like a traveling road show all this reminds me of is like the Barnum Bailey circus they're going to go from city to city touring\nTogether bill and Hillary Clinton I'm trying to picture what what how people would react how the mainstream media would react to the announcement the Georgian Barbara Bush were going to go on a multi city ... billion dollar tour [laughter] you imagine what the Washington Post would be saying about\nOh the New York times or Don Lemon and and and I'm not kidding you want to get in and watch this video clip about two

guy like Don Lemon who is just as it becomes on glued when a guest rightfully points out that\nDemocrat activists Chen protesters who chased a U.S senator out of a restaurant or indeed a mop not lemme doesn't think that's mob mentality Don Lemon is a Democrat\nPeriod but let's listen to the lady who almost became president ever so close show called she could she could feel that you could taste\nBut alas she didn't make it across the finish line the American people rejected Hillary Clinton as she still can't quite get over it evidently listen to what she said about Democrats Republicans\nAnd

mindset and of course thankfully the voters saw through her her call them deplorable ... hurt or demean\nMore than half the country with the wave of her hand knows who she is and what she is but you're not going to have a Democrat in today's party condemn Hillary Clinton's comments you're not going to have a Democrat\nCondemned the behavior of these protesters who are hounding Republicans and conservatives in the public space chasing a Fox News channel personality through the subway in New York\nRationing him trying to get people to to try to incite people against him\nLove to know what
