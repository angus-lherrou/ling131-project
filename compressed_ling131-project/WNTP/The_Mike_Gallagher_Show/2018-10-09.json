Stein Rosenstein had him with him on the plane yesterday\nOn air force one now he's certainly capable picking up a phone the lemon the president know something's up with uh the UN and bastard but what is going on we are standing by and awaiting remarks from the president of the United states are following Nikki Haley's resignation\nLot of people calling them texture and got a lot of people on hold never really trusted her\nPets and I'm going to admit this I've always had a funny feeling in the ... to my stomach about Nikki Haley I've always wondered about her worry it had nothing to do is going to need to do with the Confederate battle flag that was one part of it but there's just something about her in the way she has\nPerformed in her capacity as UN ambassador that has sort of bothered me\nIt's almost as if she's not hasn't been fully on board and there was speculation that perhaps she's the one who wrote the anonymous article in the New York times again I'm speculating here it's gross rank\nSpeculation but perhaps\nShe was anonymous there she was part of the deep state and and it was revealed the President Trump and that's the end of that [noise] I don't\nBut my I I Know everybody needs to talk about breaking news but this really isn't a big deal of people come and go into the ministry patients whether Clinton whether it's Reagan's this is all powerful the coals these jobs you alive I truly you alive\nAnd uh let's wait and see a ... for what the reason is the recognition\nAnd I'm Glad you said that because it's it's easy for all of us who are sort of observers\nTo say how do you because I always instinctively say gosh why would you why would you leave the White House why would anybody walk away from that job and of course\nI can look at my own career and I've made decisions that people have said why did you do that and it turned out to be a pretty good move for me but you know at the time people will say oh my gosh you're resigning from WABC radio in New York and yeah I took a chance to run into syndication and it worked out don't you know you're Twenty years later\nPretty good I mean the people make decisions based on things like the the the brutal treatment you get\nWhen you're in that fish bowl and so I I really do get it um and maybe that's what this does it must be something to do is Sebastian if if if the two of them are making a joined announcement it has\nTo be something that's positive that's good you know what I mean and and people are going crazy with him on my tax line of people calling in saying things like maybe is is is Lindsey Graham going to become attorney general is she going to get some position where is that\nWe can I things around ... boat down [noise]\nAnd how much fun when I\nKnow you're you're getting your your getting to be like the ... the crazy in the mainstream media you know and now has a bitter or do that but that's about the deep cuts for about ... that's a big insult Dr ... and ... when when the left goes the chaos in the white I Know that I'm going hey\nGuys if if the last twenty mom says big payoff I was will pay off yeah\nNo kidding no economy you know can I say if you look at the border you look at unemployment if is I mean people have\nTo understand the president of the time is it your average bureaucrats probably even a politician right he's the man who has been round ... successful in the private sector\nWell and you talk about chaos Dr ... you're talking about chaos to bring me the kind of chaos that results in judge Brett Kavanaugh now in the hill\nAnd I will call in here in the history of book has jumped to\nHas there ever been a more perfectly timed book than your book why we fight defeating America's enemies are no apologies because let's be very blunt here sometimes America's enemies are from within and what we witnessed over the last few weeks I I I Know you had to be as disgusted as the rest of us\nAre totally because I Lived in I've been through it will be accusations made against me and the White House and you know we ... we had a saying in the west wing ... when all this stuff was going on you only take flack when you're over the targets but but this\nWas disgusting and the interesting thing about my ... fine which of course I wrote long before ... was was you know nominated rice\nIs there's a chapter in there by the great American Hero so the book is about all the threats America faces and ... the president's going to do about them but they're not how these personal stories about or amazing American heroes and the last one is a guy called wicked chambers that most\nAmericans probably Ninety five percent of millennials have never heard of but Whitaker chambers most of the tunnel before Kavanaugh was born so just just a little sound bite\nThis is the man who stood up for the truth in the first televised congressional testimony ever\nIn Nineteen forty eight right he stood up to say I was a former communist and I can tell you who the communist are inclined the government and what happened to him\nThe left when crazy they used to have of having an affair they accused him of being close the homosexual they used to being responsible for the brothers that all of it might was a lie that I'm so used to live on\nThe end of the day he won because he stood up for the truth so anybody who says that he was just going by the treatment jobs overseas a guess what the Democrats have been doing it for about seven years mind\nAnd and it's gotten so bad that it's almost at a fever pitch and I and frankly I'm hoping and praying that Americans remember\nWhat has happened over the last month come November the six because you know there and they are on record you know it and we've seen them promising left and right impeaching Kavanaugh house members threatening and promised scene investigation of Brett Kavanaugh they don't want this thing to end\nAnd if they get control the house in the Senate We're going to be and we're in for a world of hurt\nWe look I've chosen the title of the book for a reason why we fight we now have the will to protect the republic I'm thinking about this for a second you remember what Harry Reid said about the lives Tom said hey why\nHe won didn't remember what he doesn't win did he he didn't win by\nYeah that's that's what we have to face Mike yeah the last ... made a bond with the devil may have said that\nEnds meaning getting power\nJustifies what ever mean whether it's a line about Mitt Romney's taxes or whether it's accusing a little boy scout I mean brass have in the ... is a boy scout for the last three years and we've been accused him of being a serial rapist gang\nRushed made women gang I mean yeah\nIt is it pure evil yeah and if if we think they're going to stop because we won this one forget about it they're going to ramp it up you've already seen the article saying we have to go even further wants none of them\nLet's let's remind ourselves who James Hodgkinson mind I mean this is a name that shouldn't be done in the brain of all Americans James Hodgkinson\nWill they Bernie Saunders volunteer right the left who took an automatic rifle in a hand gun to a baseball field in Virginia with a hit list of Republican Congress\nI mean all those shows these Phillies\nWhen did the right down the ... when does the riots actually normalized violence so whether it's an Schieffer whether a baseball field in a rifle this is how should that you get when you say and justify the me and my ... from from my vote\nIf you if you buy into that lost the philosophy ... eventually lead to we've seen it a law under you know leads to the goo lie leads to the desktop because if you'll end to go by any means then you'll do what ever it hey\nThis is why you got to get his book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and I'm not kidding you as the as the Kavanaugh bloodbath unfolded I thought ... Sebastian Gorka is the smartest guy in the universe title his book the way he title there because it's ... it's a primer\nFor later right after November the sex get the book and Dr Sebastian Gorka

it's pretty close to a category three of its not already a category so we're very well prepared FEMA's ready we're already\nSpoke with Governor Scott spoke to everybody that you have to speak to and I I think that uh hopefully we'll get lucky but maybe that won't happen [noise] but we're prepared [noise] I wanted\nDo this because Mickey LA\nTo the United nations has been very special to me she's

on the campaign has been really a long\nVery intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year the other two year period but the end of the year I Want to take a little time off an editor when she's been very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise]\nFor eight years and then she uh she did this and this is possibly the more in tune with what's going\nI'm very dangerous thing a lot of things [noise] but she has a job but we've done a fantastic I gather we've solved a lot of problems or one of the process of sound like a lot of

a blessing and I want to thank you for that I don't know if I didn't\nIn ten years with the United states on foreign policy now the United states has written countries may not all I\nDo think that what we\nSee now that if we say we're going to do something we fall when the president in front of that whether it was it the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was saying that other countries have to pay their share of whether the ... were given a main thing they get the ... that that enabled all the time\nAt the university when one\nMillion and he when he made it made it more now than we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green North Korean sanctions on the packages which were the largest and generation down in a way that we didn't really work\nAnd the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country need to understand you can't\nThings they're doing you harm to them for the ... they are I think you look at the anti Israel violence and then try and encourage that the president showed in moving the embassy and showing the random to world we hope ...\nThings where we want to buy I and you know all of them have had made a huge difference in the U.S but I can tell you that um\n[noise] he went to the drawing again any alternative drawing in a way to make all\nFearing proud and I didn't want to say that it's not just to find and\nFamily in general
