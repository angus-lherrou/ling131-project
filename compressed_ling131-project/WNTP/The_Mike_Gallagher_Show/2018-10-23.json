vote for them\nA couple years ago he's Democrats while on the wall\nNow all of a sudden because Trump is saying they're quiet no no no we need this wall and the American people want this wall if you let the people and put them in detention centers and so you can process the mall\nWhile those detention centers are full of that though there's too poor to point problem they're number one the detention centers are full from the last caravan\nAnd number two you saw what happened they got federal judges to say you can't separate children from from adults in terms of their detention centers and if you have them together as a family you can only keep them there for X number of days before you have to turn them loose end of the population and us\nYou know we're turning thousands and

population an added to those numbers so\nAh the wall is a part of the solution but it is not the only solution and ah\nAnd I don't know what the answer is other than what our Jane Harman set in that bring our lawmakers back\nClose the loop holes changed the wording of the fear of persecution or asylum claims that we allow in this country and really and also add that third you know third nation or

come at this from a little direct little different direction from one of the applications are the results that will happen if the if Trump in America starts poking things on their own interests it'll be seen and the rest of the world\nIn a positive way and for instance my wife and I support an orphanage in Kenya is missionaries in Kenya for one of the things they've got to do is focus on their own interests as well\nAnd what globalism allows them to do is say hey we can put your interest aside\nBecause we're not going to allow cars to come in here we're going to because of global warming up big global assist you were not going to let him instead of focusing on our own people were just going to take this money that we meet some carbon emission standards\nAnd it just it just under ... the people developing for themselves\nThat's a good on ... and it's a it's a thoughtful response I mean I Want to go a little bit more to the core of accusing somebody who calls him or herself a nationalist a racist or an anti Semite\nDoug do you think Don Lemon really believes that forest adjusted attempt to to to attack\nAnd and tear down the president at any expense [noise]\nOh yeah I mean absolutely it's an attempt to tearing down because he doesn't realize the application of what are you saying we're\nWe're going to like oh you're talking about John Lennon yeah right and it\nJust trying to take us away from some are focusing on America's needs and focusing on other people's\nNeeds exactly\nI mean you and and you look at what Germany therefore not focusing on their own people's needs they're focusing on Greece's needs and refugees needs and they're not focusing on their own people\nBut what about what about our military does ... do the men and women of the the Army Navy Airforce Marines are they a bunch of national wish because they they fight for and defend the United states they're not fighting for Belgium\nThey're not worried about France or they nationalist she you know ... and again very very thoughtful reaction to what he went to the very thoughtless\n... remarks by Don Lemon she doesn't believe that there's no way that a guy on national television I don't care how biased she is believes that if you say you're a nationalist you must be a racist\nIt's an attempt you know the old drilled the left uses ... you're a racist it's a little bit like you know way when did you start feeding your wife\nOh you're a racist that is a racist thing to say\nThat's got anti Semitic overtones you know the all right the Proud Boys all these different groups\nThey they ... they they gravitate to white nationalism white national that's what Don lemons do it he's completely nationalism or being a nationalist with white nationalism\nAnd then before you know what

walking behind them\nDo you see a lot of little old ladies do you see a whole bunch of little children\nDo see a bunch of women for that matter I see a bunch of able bodied young men\nAnd then of course is what the president was referring to when he talked about\nThe makeup of these migrants who are marching towards our southern border the president weighed in on it last night at a huge rally at the Toyotas center in Houston you're watching it on TV man it was it was it was something to watch\nIt's almost as if everything is coming together as once again another perfect storm to let Republicans achieve what is the political impossibility\nIt's politically impossible\nRepublicans keep the house in the Senate in an off year election when when a Republican when ... when a Republican president who's in control is in office it never happens to the vet\nPolitical party gets to hold the house in the Senate shame with Democrats it never works Clinton's it offers Republicans have a big

science nine Ninety dot com\nShows that are multiplying alright I got chills when I read this piece by Piers Morgan for the daily mail listen to this given all the fire brim stone in perpetual outrage about Trump since he won the White House\nThis is truly a remarkable ... state of affairs of course America's liberals will respond to the shock poll in the way they respond to all things Trump with fury\nIn ... in in I always get this right now in ... in ... I Wish to have a hard time of that word and by sticking their collective heads understand\nThe the mourners referring to the poll that came out this week the show's Trump at a forty seven percent approval rating according to the NBC Wall Street Journal poll forty seven percent\nObama was at forty five percent at the same exact stage of his presidency right before the midterms up twenty ten showed Trump is accorded NBC\nMore popular than Obama was at this time in Obama's presidency how can this be happening they will whale uncontrollably writes Piers Morgan what the blank is wrong with people who like him they will how do each other's kale salads\nThis was the end of planet earth they will sob in their normal understated manner [laughter]\nAll of which will be music to the years of Trump a man who absolutely rebels and liberals hysteria because he knows it works for him there's this new poll proves the more Trump bashore scream abuse at at about him the more it fires up his base and indeed the more fires up Trump himself after\nAll that is part of the president's street fighting New Yorker who loves a good scrap\nAnd into each time writes Morgan he may delivered the biggest knockout punch of his presidency until recently it was widely assumed the Republicans would lose control the house in\nThe midterm elections it was being depicted as a damning referendum on Trump and historically most presidents like Obama take a whack and the midterms but now he says I'm not so sure in fact I'd say there's a very good chance the Republicans will hang on to the house\nIt was the Senate and Trump will move on empowered and emboldened to what could very well be even bigger winning twenty twenty why is this happening he says\nWell first the U.S mainstream media has become the boy who cried wolf\nThey're constantly collective outrage over every tiny thing Trump says tweets or does much of a driven by commercial self interest has had the inevitable effective diluting the impact of that outrage barely a week goes by without some suppose the new Trump crisis fueling wall to wall cable news coverage\nAnd dire predictions of impeachment or even jail time for Trump yeah within a few days each administrators shouldn't threatening scandal quote unquote dissolves into a giant nothing burger\n\nShe says I look at Democrats today and I see a party this word absolutely nothing about how to beat Donald Trump and I see a president who's growing stronger by the day Trump has become a political Godzilla crushing everyone who dares challenge him and bulldoze his way through an agenda that is beginning to pay real dividends that it goes on to list all the accomplishments\nThe tax cuts the regulations the economy North Korea trade war with China trends pursue a big part all the things and he's clamp down hard on illegal immigration\nPiers Morgan says as I write this\nCaravan of thousands of Central American migrants most of them from Honduras is moving toward the southern border\nThey intend to try to enter the U.S illegally\nIt's hard to think of a more powerful image to vindicate Trump's much criticized demand for a new wall isn't it\nAs he tweeted full aperture being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border the caravans or a disgrace to the Democratic party changed the immigration laws now Morgan says\nHe's the president is beginning to really enjoy himself he's exuding an Arab someone who's worked out how Washington works or rather doesn't and how to play the broken highly partisan system to his advantage\nLove him or load him Piers Morgan writes in this terrific piece there is no desire to deny that he's winning\nOnce again I can only advise the Democrats to stop their ridiculously self defeating state of perpetual Trump outrage and work out how they're actually going to beat him because right now he writes Trump is kicking your\nButt and he does not use the word but he uses another four letter words it's a great piece by Piers Morgan\nI wanted to share it with you here on the Mike Gallagher show want to remind you about our friends with the job creators network you and I know

I don't want to not have a hard I don't want to turn my back on somebody trying to flee an oppressive nation\nBut every video clip I see a reporter standing by the side of the road with all the
