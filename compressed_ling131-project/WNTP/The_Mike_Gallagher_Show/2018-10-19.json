I made the statement that the Senate ... that the people must rule eventually\nTo which the leftist critics like this fellow from GQ would respond but the Senate prevents the majority from rolling so I'd like to expand on on how in fact the majority will work its will as it did in the thirties it just takes some time\nThat trade well so you know obviously if there's if there's a public opinion\nSo told\nMadison many there to supply and places in the federalist where Madison's a describes what will be achieved by the constitution and in the fifty first federalist forty nine to can't remember now sorry he says I'm\nA a\nIt is the reason alone of the people that should be placed in control of the government\nTheir passions should be controlled by it\nNow how do you achieve that well you spread authority across the country that is what the Senate does but then the second thing is even bigger than that and just think just the whole structure of the constitution if he were the argument to get rid of the Senate is an argument to get rid of the whole constitution\nBecause the house has represented from districts every\nTwo years\nAnd the Senate is elected for six years from states and the president is elected nationally every four years and then a lot of the power is is lodged in the states and they have lots of different systems right\nAnd that means to get a big dramatic thing done you have to ... you have to ask the people their opinion over a series of elections\nAnd there's been an interesting you just gave the game away though um it's an attack on the constitution right not really an attack on the Senate it's an attack on the constitutional\nThe whole thing and and the to the end of what that's what we really got to get to wire people attacking the Senate in order to attack the constitution what is the motive Larry on what is their objectives\nWell the cat the attack on the competition started with the rise what was you know they've been several there was one one slavery became a big deal people decided they loved it under the influence by the way of a bunch of ... ideas of the evolution foreign to the founding of America [noise]\nBut they didn't they were attacking the constitution are supporting it you know abolitionists would attack the cops to his it protects slavery a southerners wanted more Confederate too wide more slavery would attack it because it doesn't give us enough protection for our slaves in the territories\nRight so these things are not new but the current one starts in the Eighteen eighties nineties Woodrow Wilson is a big author and what he says is this regime of checks and balance\nIt's a it's a like Newton like his picture of the universe but now we have dar one and we know the government is living organism and has to change right so the the progressive movement is very impatient\nWith is because the fact that people should understand is right the effect of the constitution is to make public opinion powerful in a sustained way\nIn the end even today with the government has its limits on more than half of the economy right even today it does matter so very much what the people think\nAnd to sustain that and get that that is what the constitution does but their idea that progressive will Joe Wilson for example what he thinks is experts people who know people who can apply science to public policy should become much more influential in the government\nAnd that's what gives rise to this fourth branch of government which now makes most of our laws and in forces them and and educate them in their independent ... hundred and fifty or so independent agencies\nThat that's where all that came from and it is by the way a change in the nature of sovereignty\nBecause sovereignty came in the in the American revolution according to the nature of the individual then you're born a person you're not born a horse or a dog and so you have to be by your nature govern only with your consent the new way as\nWe have power over nature now and if we use science and knowledge we can perfect society and people who have that science and that knowledge they become a new kind of suffering\nAnd so of course the competition must be swept away because it's specific achievement is that it keeps the people in control of the government for a long time\nAnd that is the whole game in every attack on the Senate and that is why today Hillsdale dialogue needs to travel far and wide before these elections and hopefully we'll even got some no nothing's of constitutional intent and freedom to pay attention to a doctor\nBreaking news at a breakneck face this yourself Mike Gallagher show\nWe're not going to cover it again was never that\nWe thought we got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ...

towards the U.S Mexico border with the intent of crossing the southern border into the United states and President Trump has made it very clear this will not stand\nWe're all sorry for people who feel oppressed in other countries that does not mean we can afford to have thousands of people poor across our border and enter our country illegally\nThis is the ultimate blank you to President Trump's desire to build a wall and secure our borders\nAnd frankly Democrats think this is great politically the optics if there's a wonderful yeah I Do too I Do to\nAmericans elected Donald Trump largely because of the legal immigration problem the last thing the Democrats need right now for those who are undecided those in the middle those who may not be motivated to go to the polls in November the ... the last thing Democrats need\nIs the image of thousands of illegals trying to march into our United States of America at a time like this I guarantee you Donald Trump will respond\nAccordingly I

coms Audi oh my God like [noise]\nSo fortunate\nThat I get to come to a city like Tampa, Florida and interact with hundreds of people who listen to us on the radio and support our message being Suzie as in the\nFuel in the room like the the the the the theater last night at\nThe stretch Center for the performing arts so tangible is so palpable and the excitement and the optimism the cautious optimism so many people have\nFor the November six mid term election is very real I don't know what's gonna happen but I Know what ought to happen\nBecause too many great things are happening right now in our country and I it was fun to hear voices\nColleagues of mine friends to be on stage would use you in and Dr Sebastian Gorka last night Kaylee Mac and any from the RMC to get different perspectives but we're all sort of rowing in the same direction we know\nWe know where the country is today and where we are heading as long as the voters\nContinue to keep employed the Republicans in control the house in the Senate it all roads lead to November the ...\nAnd we've got some real existential threats going on we got thousands of migrants headed for the U.S Mexico border from Honduras from Guatemala a wonder what's gonna happen\nAnd there isn't it fascinating the Democrats think that somehow this is their political moment somehow they think it's to their advantage\nThe thousands of people are doubling down\nAgainst the president who has vowed to close the border\nThis is as far as many of us are concerned a threatened invasion of the United states I don't know how you describe thousands of people saying we're going to illegally cross the border\nAnd and and come into the United states whether you like it or not\nNot only will the American people not stand for it\nWhich president won't either and the ones who are out of touch the ones who are going to lose on this issue or the Democrats\nThe crazy Democrats as President Trump called them last night and another one of his political rallies you had to stop and men to Montana more on that and just a moment it's important for me to listen to smart voices and I tried to do that all the time when you call me\nAt one eight hundred six five five might listen carefully\nI think I Know my audience better than just about any radio host in America I Believe I was one of the few radio hosts nationally who saw\nThe need and heard people say we don't want another politician in the White House we got to try something else I Am ... by the way has this real weird pension he's got a strange sense of humor he likes to tell a crowd\nOh here's Mike Gallagher ladies and gentlemen he's been a never Trump or from day one\nAnd of course I've got to try to correct to him and everybody laughs but I'm always afraid that in a room full of six hundred people fifty or more think he's telling the truth\n[laughter] so I always have to correct them knows you you're the one who actually wavered on President Trump in the beginning you're the one who had to come along you're the one we had to win over\nAnd for some they still have and what\nWe haven't won them over rather they still haven't seen the light they still haven't recognize the extraordinary accomplishments of the first twenty months there to greet pieces I have in front of me one by Fred Barnes over Weekly Standard and the other by John Dempsey\nAbout how Trump has freed the Republican Party from the media I Want to start with a few I Want to start with the Fred Barnes piece over some facts\nBecause I like to argue with knowledge I Want to make sure that as you vote as you encourage your neighbors to vote as you get ready to go to the polls don't believe the lie that somehow the rock Obama\nSets the groundwork for this tremendous economy we're enjoying right now Fred Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're going to posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it Fred Barnes rights but rock Obama is a proud men\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he too to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punch no surprise there either if the Democrats won the election twenty six gene Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted he's referring to ... percent he's referring to the growth rate\nBut the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine was regulation in tax cuts\nAre shifting was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes in the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct about the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening the shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of gross from down to up\nThat's what tax cuts deliver and tax hikes do not here's the Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this ally that Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's a proud man\nIt's kind of in theory that he had such a head makes such a silly plane here are some facts\n... Obama's successor Trump and the Republican Congress reverse Obama's policies\nThe fact is Obama had to struggle so hard to spur the economy and allow it to grow more than two percent a year that was the high watermark for bronco bomb in the last quarter of Obama's presidency growth pitch slipped to one point five percent\nIt's obvious what Obama's problem was he had the wrong policies watch of wrong policies\nFrom the day Trump was elected\nWe've had a more real best robust economy\nNearly four million jobs have been added four million jobs unemployment is dip to the lowest points in nearly a half century ... Barnes says let's compare what Obama did with Trump\nWhat he's doing Obama raised taxes Trump cut that Obama was a regulatory sell it Trump is passionate\nAbout deregulation Obama's clean Power Plan killed the coal industry Trump is reviving it Obama downgraded the role of entrepreneurs and free markets in boost the economy and lauded the wonderful things government does Obama's biggest biggest breakthrough as we know\nWas the Affordable CARE Act a big step toward a single payer government run health care system Trump got rid of the individual mandates that forced everyone to buy expensive insurance or be fine a big step toward a return to free markets in health care\nBill the entire Obama economic agenda was systematically reverse\nSays economics writer Stephen Moore whose new book Trump ... we've got to get even more and Arthur Laffer lamps on the show one of these days presidents loved it\nA White House report issued recently said it was a bit is raging had produced two hundred and eighty nine accomplishments in twenty months we all know Trump's exaggerates and brags Fred Barnes rights but many of the economic gains will\nImpressive especially the fact that job openings out number job seekers for the first time on record being a liberal himself Obama relied on liberal economist\nThey let him astray as they did president John Kennedy in the Nineteen sixties they favored higher taxes to base favored increase spending\nThose policies created an economic downturn but Kennedy\nWas smarter than Obama says Fred he finally turned to his Republican treasury secretary she dug was doing who recommended tax cuts JFK grabbed onto them\nAnd the result was an economic boom the roaring sixty rages advisors persuaded him the tax cuts championed by Jack Kemp would do far more for the economy than spending cuts\nThey even use JFK's as an example\nThe sweeping tax cuts of Nineteen eighty one brought about years of strong growth notice the Reagan Revolution Trump didn't need to be convinced obviously he and Republicans led by Paul Ryan believed it was time for deep cuts in the corporate tax rates the Obamas school of economists\nAnd commentators embarrassed by anemic results argued that economic growth was stuck perhaps permanently at two percent annually Batman Obama\nWas doing the best any president could do surely far better than Trump would have done right all kinds of dire predictions Washington Post said Trump could destroy the world economy Jason farming German of Obama's council of economic advisors said Trump's budget assumes three percent annual growth that's extremely unlikely\nI'm good thanks why do you think this will benefit the Democrats and not the Republicans\nWell I'm worried I don't think I get worried because like they're going to be a lot of children and families and yeah I'm afraid of like the whole than it rained out saying with the military there and [noise] ...\nYeah you're leaving out all this thing yeah yeah I I don't I think we're in a different time though Laura I really do a guy this is a different time where people are fed up\nI I don't under I don't hear a lot of people having a great amount of sympathy for thousands of people marching towards the United states it feels like an invasion\nEven if there are children along with men and women [noise] where do we what do you hear what the president had to say about it last night at his rockers rally\nIn Montana we've got the video and the audio want to join this micro online dot com and joined us on air one eight hundred six five five my thanks Laura More coming up\n[noise]\nHe was ... million Ninety more intelligent conservative talk [noise]\nThe other problem with these fancy a ... a tooth brushes that are electric they are they cost an arm and a leg they're very expensive and it's a pain in the neck to replace the the brush head which my doctor my doctor tells me all the time you got to replace them once a month sensitive sonic vibrations are available from the new quip toothbrush\nQuip is amazing I Love where I've I've read that quip but I\nFound out and doing my due diligence they're backed up by over ... backed by over twenty thousand dental professionals equipped starts at just twenty five dollars and if you do to get quick dot com slash my G. you'll get your first rebuilt pack for free with a quip electric toothbrush\nNow there's this quick Q.
