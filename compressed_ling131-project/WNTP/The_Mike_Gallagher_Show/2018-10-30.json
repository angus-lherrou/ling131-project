Philadelphia\nNews ... nine Ninety\nNine Ninety\nOn this day of October twenty Eighteen we're one week from voting and I'm joined by hotline\nJosh Josh crush our National Journal follow him on Twitter and hotline Josh Josh I'm\nDialed in on the Senate very very carefully I saw a new NBC Marist Poll that says ... ... they had by five points that is simply a hundred percent different from the internal that I've seen and trust what do you know about Arizona\nI'll take two things about Arizona both Democrats and Republicans I talked to him in the last few days\nHave this race within the margin of error or Republicans may have mix Sally up by a point or two Democrats may have sent 'em up one or two but this is a race that's extremely close it's also a race that is dependent on the national environment in other words\nYou know if Trump gets up to forty four percent of the national old is really good news for mark fairly if you know the past week the news and drops Trump's job approval rating down to forty percent edited the Gallup poll yesterday Jeff knocked is perfect Sally cinema\nFor going to be it would be one of the closest Senate races around the country and it really is going to be dependent on the national environment and how people are feeling when the cat's out\nHere over at mid term madness which I Am playing along with my listener Josh I have mixed Sally winning by more than four because I I Do not believe for a second but it's close or after the um\nThe cinema meltdown I thought it was close until the cinema melt down but I just can't see Republicans walking even if they hate Donald Trump I just don't see them voting for Christian send them a she made herself electable\nSo the big test and this raises the cinema as sort of remade herself into this as moderate that figure even though she has a long a very well documented history of sort of anti war radicalism lunch when you read eleven so the question is are voters gonna hold that against or taking a look at her more recent\nA record as a congresswoman I I think those are infected of information and and all those recordings of her you know if they say in a lot of lot of pretty radical things back in the day is very damaging ... sort of personal\nNot talk to be a little bit about the uh New Jersey race because Bob Menendez is in my view the Roy Moore of the Democratic party unacceptable to a wide swath of normal people as a bad guy or not people to possibly put Bob Hugin in the Senate\nSo if this was a normal and this was one of us leap year mid term election Bob and then this will be serious trouble probably would lose reelection but because New Jersey of all states very suburban state on work idled truckers are particularly popular\nTo put it mildly a he's probably favorite is going to survive at all likely to just because of the blue wave in New Jersey it's hard to see when you have an environment in a state that favors a party even damage incumbent like Bob and that is probably going to win by narrow margins of usual\nBut he'll probably end up end up with one another and hugging is a great campaign\nRunning I see flawless that every time\nThat now I I think Kevin Cramer is put one in the Republican column and take away I think Josh ... but when the Republican column and take away but I don't I Know my son is they had but I don't know if it's take away yet and I think Rick Scott is tied or slightly behind margin of error is that your assessment\nThat's pretty much it uh Missouri and the one thing to watch the ... and Indiana Senate races were pulling away towards the Republicans in the last week you know Trump took a little bit of a hit a politically and a lot in the last week I Would want to look at those numbers against the Democrats have made some\nMovement but look these are conservative states Donald Trump ... double digits or his views on immigration her popular in the states like Missouri in Indiana so I I generally think always a slight favorite in Missouri or Mike Braun a slight favorite and Indiana\nCertainly North Dakota as you mentioned is looking very favorable or the Republicans\nAnd those are the three top pickup opportunities Florida is not looking good for Republicans both in the governor's race and in the Senate race still competitive but but I think Rick Scott as the underdog and ... and ... to starting to pull away from us and\nWhat's interesting is that day David Rohde says freebie can just published a Florida polls showing it to one point race in the Senate side done say about the governors ah the ... the United states has tweeted\n[laughter]\nIf the fed back soften starts talking a little more dovish I think we're going to be right back to twenty twenty on target rate we've

but it might also bounce back to that you never at markets are markets Josh rush hour what do you think the impact is of the market so\nYou always hear about the October surprise that maybe the November surprise last week of is has not been good for the White House but the ... the pipe bomb merely horrible shooting him in Pittsburgh if a synagogue and the stock market has lost you know another point for the last week this is not what the kind of Trump wanted\nRight before the midterm election that's what we're hearing\nTalk about immigration and trying to tourists in such a birthright citizenship [noise] um\nSo I you know like I I don't think a lot of lot of people's minds are locked in but again if if there's if there's any party that has momentum in the final the Democrats do have a swing every step\nI you know I'm going to make one one correction that I think there's a rebound against the left for going crazy at like Marsha Blackburn the last thirty seconds to I just think the Julia Ioffe on CNN Marsha Blackburn demonstrator Josh it makes people\nBreaking news at breakneck face this is Mike ... show\nWe're not going to make America great again was never

owned by the most famous man on the planet\nAnd you've been grade Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly now\nThe relief factor dot coms rodeo might have got like [noise]\n\nThe biggest reasons just smiled today you might hear all day long number one the president of the United states is vowing to end birthright citizenship seeing shame practice of having\nSomeone come to this country have a baby and that baby immediately becomes a citizen for life enjoying all the benefits of citizenry president says that's ridiculous we're the only country in the world to do that\nAnd it's got to stop I liked that story very much today as we're one week out that's an important reminder of what's at stake because Democrats to a person will oppose the president Andrew birthright citizenship you and I know that here's another thing to give you a reason to smile\nBig headline in USA Today [noise] I don't often see headlines in USA Today that makes me smile but this one does this is above the fold as in today's paper and I quote fifty two hundred drop the troops to block caravan\nFifty two hundred troops to block the migrant caravan without a border we don't have a country\nSovereignty matters we have a president who is willing to say we're going to stop these thousands of illegals who are on this determine march for the United states towards the United states from coming in\nAnd the Trump haters are in a fetal position because\nThey know his position on illegal immigration which is what got him elected in the first place is resonating all across the land\nI had an interesting back and forth with my producer before the show today Lance Anderson who um was done at Steve Schmidt Steve Schmidt is McCain guy right last he's a long time Republican operative I'm pretty sure he ran McCain's campaign if I'm not mistaken\n... appeared on MSNBC usually never Trump Republican who's never Trump British continue Jewish down they continue to amaze and Steve Schmidt\nSaid the following this just cut the number nine pounds later\nThis is what Steve Schmidt had to say about the president's position on protecting our border now this is important because it gets down to whether or not normal Americans expect us to have border security\nNow for four years Republicans have consistently favored border security had many Democrats due to\nThis isn't really a ... a right left issue we have border security or we don't if you get thousands and thousands of illegals from Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador\nSome of whom we are discovering are smuggling children and are bringing drugs and all kinds of crime with them\nWell of course the military should be waiting for them of course we have to protect Texas and the United states and our country we have to secure the border it's illegal what they're going to try to do\nAnd you're listening to it never Trump or like Steve Schmidt a long time Republican operative on MSNBC and I'm going to tell you about the back and forth I had with Lance Anderson about these never Trump Republicans but first of all cut nine from MSNBC and gravy and here's what she had to say\nHave never had a president of the United states do with this president as do I see is stoking a cold civil war in this country and it has turned hot\nOn the periphery newsman Bowers what was he said was when he went in and he said I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in and he went in\nTo kill Jews to choose his belief that we're financing the caravan invading army like a cancer division that is threatening the southern border and army that is a rat can riddled with disease\nThe same type of rhetoric the same type of propaganda that you would have seen in Germany in Nineteen thirty eight that the human ...\nTurning people into infested Rahman bats\nAre Republican operative named Steve Schmidt now last his point and at last was kind of a I\nHave to give them some credit because he was like ... ... ... just astounded at ... at the realization that these never Trump Republicans\nWho were in positions of of of managing campaigns and tried to help Republicans got elected last does take away was brilliant last said I Wonder Republicans kept getting beat your people like Steve Schmidt running campaigns he's a Democrat\nAnd when Lance said that it it it it sure does spark jumped into my mind and I wanted to throw it out to you\nAnd I know we've spent too much time already probably on these\nThese these these maddening never Trump hers but is Lance right that the people we're seeing bill\nKristol Jennifer Rubin Steve Schmidt you go down the list of never Trump Republicans are they really Democrats at heart in other words or they just now showing their true colors or did they flip because they hate Trump so much\nI don't I I tend to think it's the latter rather than the former I Believe they've flipped and they sound like Democrats because they hate Trump's so much they can't believe that he's having so much success and so they got to lash out\nLike a typical liberal Democrat Steve shred that audio clip and video clip of you're watching it on the stream and Mike online dot com if you if you you know as you hear that and thought\nThat's what a liberal Democrat chefs that's not what a lifelong Republican operative says Steve Schmidt worked on\nCampaigns and you go down the list Nicole Wallace ana Navarro Tim Miller David from these are all people who have been the voice of the Republican Party all these years and suddenly when a president quite reasonably sense\nWe have to stop illegals and this is a small army seven thousand people eight thousand whatever the number is I've seen fourteen thousand some media reports but the number and we keep streams seven thousand seven thousand people that's a small army you can pretend that's not a problem\nBut when you got seven thousand people a sea of humanity marching towards our southern border of course we expect the government to stop them\nAnything else says well what a Democrat would say an open borders Democrat Steve Schmidt I guess is it open borders Democrats\nSo here's my question to you as we welcome you went on a Tuesday where one week away from the most important midterm election of our lifetime and we're breaking it all down for you here in the relief factor dot com studios here's my question for you is less right\nThat these folks are showing their true colors and they have always been\nLiberal Democrats\nOr am I right they're sounding like the liberal liberal Democrats simply because they loan President Trump's so much\nAnd they can't figure out a way to stop him so they figure we're going to join the other side is you can't if you can't beat them join them their breeding they're joining the Democrats and\nSounding like open border Democrats justice stop President Trump's agenda which one is that do you think our number is eight

the planet\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly now\nFrom the relief factor dot com studio Mike yeah like\n[noise] a lot of things to afford to you on this Tuesday one week before the crucial midterm\nElection the president is a a visiting Pittsburgh today\nAnd yet there are local officials including the mayor of Pittsburgh who are declining to appear with him the mayor of Pittsburgh made it very clear he doesn't want the president in his city and it's a it's disgraceful is a\nDon't actually pretty horrific\nI'm grateful and I am comforted by the words of the rabbi at the tree of life synagogue a rabbi Jeffrey Myers was leading services during Saturday's shooting\nI saw him interviewed on a number of occasions and this was a very brave man I'm and a guy who is is a strong strong leader of that of that synagogue\nAnd he told CNN Monday the president the United states is always welcome he said I'm a citizen he's my president he is certainly welcome\nIsn't it crazy that that sounds like\nRadical talk for for a very\nCommon sense American type response\nMy gosh where have we come what have we become you can put aside your\nDifferences with the president long enough to appreciate that he is trying to support the community of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAnd supporting them and ... and pay his respects presumably with the first lady ... you're going to decline to appear with him do\nYou're going to you're going to disrespect\nHim that way you're going to disrespect the authors that way now I have a million times I get it people don't like him they don't like his tweets they don't like his style\nThey don't like all these headlines today about the illegal the legal caravan\nMarching towards the southern border they see a headline like the one I saw this morning in USA Today are watching it on the stream I'll hold it up for you so you can see a nice big a nice big cover here fifty two hundred troops to block caravan\nNow now I gotta believe that when USA Today put that headline up they thought that would make the president look bad\nNo actually makes the president look strong and it reminds millions and millions of Americans that this is a president who means what he says when he says we ought to have a secure border\nIf you've got thousands of illegals marching towards our border promising to cross the border illegally\nThe president has every every bit every bit\nOf a duty to keep the United states safe I see a headline that says fifty two hundred troops do\nBlock the caravan but I Want to celebrate I Want to say this is why the guy got elected this is why I voted for Donald Trump I hear what he said about birthright citizenship the\nPresident intends to sign an executive order and this is huge he wants to sign an executive order that ends birthright citizenship is cutters cut number four will play for you on the stream if you're watching it Mike online dot com\nJust could watch like on TV if you're on the radio just if you're in the car he got the radio just turn it up and and revel in the president's intention\nTo get rid of the ridiculous policy\nOf illegal coming into this country having a baby and then that baby becomes a lifetime citizen of the United states does prevent MSNBC and HBO and gravy and cutting number four\nAnd I this is perhaps the most inspiring thing you hear all day\nAll immigration some legal scholars believe people getting rid of a threat to the whole ship without tension the ... border that\nHave you thought about that is\nThat what it all it was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment and then you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number is human him well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nHow ridiculous that were the only country in the world\nWhere a person comes in and has it baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us history they tell us and it has to end some have you talked about sat with household\nWearing the said it's in the process it will happen\nWhen ... ... that's what you're talking about really as a very interesting I didn't think anybody but knew that but me I thought I was only on [laughter]\nWell evidently ah the reporter for Axios on HBO knew it isn't that powerful the president observe it it's ridiculous we're the only country in the world where you can enter the country illegally have a baby and then that baby gets benefits\nEntire life that child as he grows or she grows and doing adult they receive the benefits and the rewards of being a U.S citizen just because mama or daddy\nEntered this country illegally how how how incredible was that how powerful is that\nAnd you you get people on the left the critics of the president who hear that kind of promise and they're afraid they were afraid because\nHe's delivering what he promised he would do without a border we don't have a country\nWe might as well just say we're just we're just one big planet and there are no borders a little bit like Hillary fantasized\nSpeaking the Hillary did you hear about her joke friday I'll bet you didn't wasn't really covered very much I Want to play it for you\nAnd again if if you think I'm making this up you'll be able to hear with your own ears and she was your own eyes at Mike online dot com watch this video this is a from Gregory in\nHillary Clinton was joking around with a some interviewers some panel on friday the interviewer\nA woman got Cory Booker and Eric Holder\nMixed up listen to the joke that the woman who\nWanted desperately to become president on a new a new force occasions listener heard joking about race now keep in mind Megan Kelly just lost her job\nOver race Roseanne Barr lost her job over race this is a this this breaks the ...\nOf most people who happened to be right of center or Trump supporters if you're a Democrat the rules are altogether different check this out\nOf ... all\nUp by ... what do you think about it and find a stack and get to that kind of Eric Holder ...

awful I'm\nShooting in Pittsburgh John ... of the New York post wrote a very very in a movie that say about what he learned as an American Jew after the Pittsburgh synagogue attack\nHe writes on this day of all days it needs to be said America has been a blessing for the Jewish people unlike any other blushing given any other people in the history of the world one crime cannot be allowed to overshadow\nThis extraordinary fact he goes on to say my gratitude do America is actually greater today than it was yesterday because of the outpouring of grief and rage and common humanity we have witnessed in response to the horror in Pittsburgh\nThe show right we are Americans who writes and we are Jews there's no contradiction between the two when people talk freely and foolishly and noxious Lee about America as having been built on racism\nThere's one simple answer to their libel George Washington's letter to a synagogue in Newport written in August of Seventeen Ninety\nHe wrote the citizens of the United states of America have a right to applaud themselves\nFor having given to mankind examples of it in large and liberal policy a policy worthy of imitation all possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship made the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land\nContinued to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants while everyone shells sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none\nTo make him afraid those are the words of George Washington\nOf course that final phrase was taken from the profit Mica\nAnd it was violated in the most obscene way in Pittsburgh on Saturday writes John ... but the story of America is a story of a country that does indeed served as vine and fig tree for the world's most beleaguered people's\nBut ... says America took us in by many millions and the founding doctrine which Washington diluted in his letter made this country something vastly greater blue\nOnly the only true threat to the Jewish people comes not from hate but from love the problem for American Jews the argues\nThe late Irving Kristol used to say is that if they want to kill us but they want to marry us [laughter] part difficulty is maintaining the separateness necessary to the continuation of the Jews as a people because America has so taking us to its ...\n\nThis is a tragically low moment he writes a day when the words we speak on Passover really came home in every generation they rise up against us to destroy us\nMall with the Fox business report and Carol semi\nImagining a better bank search was looking at the savings rates most banks offer in saying really\nCapital one is building something better you can open a capital one savings account with one of the nation's best savings range from anywhere like here where here\nOne of the nation's best savings re opened on line at a capital one location or from anywhere bats banking reimagining what's in your wallet for consumers on me for capital one ... twenty eight in capital one\nGallagher now ... on news talk nine nine conservative [noise]\nMy I really am a just a big fat ... uh\nI hate those commercials on TV that show the shivering dog show the shivering dogs that show the [noise] um\nI Can't stand those those commercials that show animals but get I mean I I'm not exactly a hunter trust me I once went hunting and I had nightmares about the quail that I shot for we still have the nightmare\nShow a few weeks ago I was mortified when I had the video that we should dream that showed the polar bear petty and the dog it turns out it's possible that the polar bear ate the dog and people were traumatized I think we found a better video so if you love animals and you want a happy ending\nTo an animal of video I've got one in the wild great white shark meat she'll but it works out okay\nSo I'm going to give you time to come to the stream at Mike online dot com if you want to watch the video 'cause it's good news I think now I can guarantee that the shield doesn't wind up later being eaten by some other white shark but this one he gets it's pretty cool I like these major videos at least when it works out\nI mean I Am I I'm showing I embarrassed myself over stuff like this on a regular basis yours do last night other like tough macho man we're probably out smoking cigars their buddies I was watching the wicked fifteenth anniversary on NBC\nI mean that that I used to have a friend who was in wicked so I Know and I even audition wants to be the wizard so not a happy story 'cause I was sick and I blew it I might have been the wizard on on Broadway ah\nYears ago but I miss my chance any way that their fiftieth anniversary of Christians are Christian shuttle with who I Love and ... who is also tremendous\nAnd it was so cheesy but it was so wonderful it was great [laughter] I just want to do I barest myself hey on DVD and Blu ray today nothing embarrassed about the most talked about political documentary of the year the national issues as death of a nation\nThere are only a few days we've got one wait till the midterm election this movie is crucial you got to see this before you cast your vote at six it's an explosive examination of America packed with hard hitting troops\nGet your topic today a death of the nation movie dot com it's out now death of a nation movie dot com Selma which do angry about the mayor of Pittsburgh refusing to appear with President Trump today that she called his office I've told hey Selma how are you\nYes Mike I reminded him that I'm only one state as fifty so she is editor of the country at this gentleman wrote Web uniform candidate that was\nThat well to be beautiful\nStarted wonderful but I haven't had that I'm a citizen that way and it has a responsibility to comment\nAnd I call her now and I hate to say that I look fellows you so on on that and how dare he he's not speaking for this was a sale so generally that already written document and now you know\nBut yeah I mean you know when I've been thinking about Selma and I'm Glad you mentioned is about about the Jewish people's reaction to to this president at one of the great mysteries for Michelle Obama has been to see\nAn American Jews turn on Republicans and Republicans arguably have such a a healthy respect and and a sacred respect for the state of Israel\nAnd yet Democrats are often taking the side of the Palestinians are seemingly understanding this kind of violence and horrible things that Israel has to deal with on a regular basis demonizing and vilified Israel so along comes this Republican president\nWho literally fulfilled his promise of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nAnd how could Jewish Americans not embrace this president\nI suspect many do and I have a hunch that since President Trump fulfilled his promise to do just that with the embassy and acknowledge in Jerusalem as the real capital of Israel that\nYou know there are a lot more there's a lot more Jewish support than any other Republican would have gotten or because believe me Republican and democratic presidents all made the promise to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and none of them came through until this guy\nThanks for eight minutes before the hour one open line now eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four five three I'm going to give you about two minutes if you love animals and you want to see a really cool video in the wild this is in some I don't even some body of water I don't know where it took place but it was a great white shark\nI'm at a seal and the c._e._o. gets away it's a cool videos all play in about sixty seconds or so you can see it because and again I don't know that there's not a uh\nUltimately a bad ending for this deal I'm praying there isn't but I think we can redeem ourselves with the ill fated polar bear and the dog video that went to ride a week or two ago with this video replay worried about sixty seconds is Kerry Kerry thanks very much for joining us how are you\nLike banking taking my call on a rabbi in Ohio at first\nI Want to thank you for your ... or the Jewish people and if Israel and pleasure meeting you when you're in Columbus that six eight ... I'm a non white Jewish people are suspicious that Republicans I think it goes back to when the kids were mostly the party at white Anglo saxon Protestants\nAnti Semitism was fairly common in the in that community but things have changed and I'll be out of the folks I Know in the Christian Community of very pro Jewish pro Israel and the up and ask same question you're asking unfortunately many of\nMy fellow Jews are out are more concerned about progressive politics and they are about the Jewish\nLady let me ask a rabbi what are what are they said about this president considering what he did with the embassy in movie that from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem are people coming around in your community\nSome of them are there's a lot of ambivalence unfortunately because they focus you know they get they get a lot of their information from the other a mainstream media outlets yeah and I hear it but that's about it so they're focusing on his style and not a substance\n... exactly and that's and that's a downfall rabbi that many people have and that's unfortunate because you know you gotta put your big board pass on to you got to say what's getting done like Larry Elder always tells a joke about the the two golfers what makes a great golfer\nAnd the one guy says well I like to look at the shoulders of how he addresses the ball and where his his knees are in his hips and what does follow through and he goes on and on with some boring exploration and the other guy says\nI Want to see where the ball lands and we like the way the ball was landing with this president even though he might not swear up his shoulders and address the ball properly alright here we go this is your moment away from politics\nWere building up a lot and I hope you have a chance to check out the video streaming Mike online dot com more and more people are doing it\nWe had up to them I think Fifteen hundred people a week or two ago and it's been kind of fun we're going to also introduced this new feature the after show with ... in a week or two now but here's a here's a video courtesy of gravy and\nThis is a great white shark attempting to eat a CEO and sometimes great whites come out of a water to to go after their prey which is often the seals this you'll get your way check it out will play their says I narrated 'cause it's\nReally cool to have we got the video plane\nThere it is this is so cool to watch\nUh the the voters to film it and the great white comes out of a water looking at\nThat tries to get the CEO and can't get this to the seal the seal like we're goes away and the seal is not going to be lunch for that particular great white shark at least not that day was not that time when the people in the boat were just stunned by the way they captured that\nOne video isn't that cool we try to always play some uh\nSomething that might catch your eye\nAs you listen to us on the radio maybe you'll check us out online as Mike online dot com and stay tuned for the after show\nThe president promising to end birthright citizenship it's about time and of course sending troops to the border this showdown is upon us it's getting closer and closer and we are one week away from the mid term election or\nLook away more than Mike Gallagher show coming up [noise]\nUsed to be nine Ninety intelligent conservative tone [noise]\nFor the news at breakneck pace this is Mike ... show\nWe're not going to make America great again was never that\nFree [laughter] we've got a\nCrucial midterm election coming up in November ...\nNineteen Seventy eight ... voice some clarity for millions of Americans\nThose oh\nWe'll just leave me with credit funny if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the fact that Clinton villages started\nThe show known about the most famous man on a planet\nEven grade Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly now\nFrom the relief factor dot coms studios might have got like\n[noise]\nIt was a lot of fun to go around the country and uh\nVarious town hall style rallies and get to be on stage with people like ... [noise] and he wrote a piece today of town hall dot com [noise] the\nRising or or or state in his belief that next Tuesday seven days from today Democrats blaming normal Americans for nuts\nOr will blow up in their faces at the ballot box I like to weigh Kurt thinks he's a he's a former army colonel so he gets a little blue with his language are always have to be careful Everytime I put them on the show\nBut he he does say\nThat he believes that normal people are going to be furious next week at the lies told and the shenanigans from\nLiberal Democrats are people on the left he says I\nThink on November ... the Democrats are going to get a message back from the people they are shamelessly lying about normal voters\nAre not going to look at what the Democrats are trying to do and say yeah I feel personally responsible for the actions of that Elizabeth Warren channeling fake Indians stripper guy with a kilometer long wrap sheet who told me he would have not done anything nutty if it weren't for Trump\n\nMakes a great point the Democrats are in a pathetic\n... and the official media as he puts it the official media is in a frenzy explaining how Donald Trump personally instructed kooky weirdo to Florida to mail pipe bombs to washed up democratic hacks and that name was garbage read in Pittsburgh via a series of constantly encrypted\nDog whistles make America great again ... apparently code for male bombs\nNothing says murdered Jews like moving the embassy to Jerusalem and indeed the Iran deal\nAnd yet the Democrats want it both ways the Democrats want to blame Trump for the male bomber and they want to blame Trump for the guy from the synagogue massacre I Wonder\nWho's to blame for what I saw this morning this happened a couple of days ago at least for shots were fired into the illusion ... county Republican parties office in South Daytona Florida police confirmed\nNo ... no one was injured but the shooting broke the officers front window and cause some damage to the dry wall oh I Know Trump's fault right Trump made somebody fire for shots into the ... county Republican Party's offices in South Daytona Florida\n[noise] um [noise] it's not Trump's fault it's not\nA Democrat's fault it's not Elizabeth Warren's fault that it's not Bernie Sanders fault that that monster tried to assassinate a bunch of Republicans on a baseball field but what we're seeing I think Kurt ... is right\nThis strategy is not gonna work for Democrats their attempt to blame the normal blamed normal Americans they didn't go to work\nIt didn't go to work and in fact I suspect Kurt is going to be right now I don't know we don't know what's gonna happen till the morning of the seven will know the night of November strict I'll be in the studios hosting the Salem Radio network town hall coverage\nOf the midterm elections on many of these radio stations all over the country we also were scheduled a habit or for you up at a town hall dot com and Mike online dot com as well we will see we're going to see [noise]\nMeanwhile the nation mourns collectively we are absolutely in unison\nAnd unified in supporting the president who's traveling to Pittsburgh today to pay his respects\nIt's a pretty disgusting\nTo see the mayor of Pittsburgh say he will not appear with the president he clearly doesn't want the president to come to Pittsburgh um and yet the rabbi of the of the synagogue where this took place\nHe told CNN very clearly how he feels I was so appreciative and so relieved to hear\nFrom the the rabbi who was on the seat this is the rabbi who was there who tried to save lives and uh you\nCould hear the CNN reporter short of trying to to go to him and just saying oh you're the president shouldn't come the president shouldn't shouldn't have ten\nWell that's not what the rabbi had to say that is not what the rabbi who was there had to say at all listen to this\nPresident Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and kind of care synagogue and the aftermath of the teams have to count [noise]\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome I'm I'm a citizen he's my president is certainly welcome\nWow I mean\nI'm a citizen he's the president he's welcome to come because he's giving aid and comfort and he's attending to the needs of people in Pittsburgh who are grieving who are mourning what an what a what a crazy idea that this rabbi has\nSevere this is where we are that was a by the way that was a palace in camera over on Fox or on CNN [noise] meanwhile there was a writer on CNN\nWho claimed to President Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS I Want you to hear this this is a writer named Julia Ioffe off\nOr eat off I O F\nF E I guess it's off the\nJulia off the set on CNN that the president well check this out for yourself and if you don't believe me if you're watching the stream it Mike online dot com you'll see it as well as here there's on the radio this is courtesy of CNN and gravy and cut number one Julie ... off the\nWith her I'm rather novel belief that the president is worse than the the monsters of ISIS\nDoes\nHave an answer right on top of that as long a crowd of radicalization and how can it has radicalized found many more people than I thought oh my God I mean the way the talk the way the way\nThat is that says it is hot\nThe way the way that whole ah allow for the ... the way that I Know I'm not stuck for ... [noise] the way that will ... will have to call and I can get any football and kind of creating ... kind of that's fine okay ... than you know\nAnd I think that we are the pushback on\nThat year and I said it was about ... I mean it was hard to say that the president faces radicalized more people that ISIS is the response of the matter is that true true based upon what\nHow many I mean how many cats and he got into an inherited ISIS ... have you know I wouldn't say that about what I said if I had at like ... yeah they\nAre I think what President has far more support or ... ... an uncle hopeful ideology\nLiterally when I got here and and now it's about listen inject I say that yeah you're right this yesterday when Louis Farrakhan sat next to Bill Clinton the other day where would the outrage\nI mean that that stuns me even even after all we've been subjected to tell me some more about the tone will you please I Want to hear the anchors of CNN complaining about President Trump's tone some more\nWhen CNN puts a crackpot like her on a panel\nAnd it certainly for the record she later apologized once she recognized the backlash that she was receiving on social media she she did back up her words a little bit or she backtracked to some degree not much but to some extent she apologized\nThat's a gash on CNN they invited the there was a guy on Fox Business the other day who said that the state department is infiltrated by George Soros Fox fired him because CNN went after that guy\n'cause she in and they all do this now I don't know if you've noticed this but on cable news now they're all playing each other's clips which you're such a weird thing to do I like I never acknowledge any other I mean I don't say I don't acknowledge other radio shows but\nI don't play many other radio clips on my show 'cause I Want everybody to listen to the Mike Gallagher show I'm a I'm kind of old school that way but now these days on cable news Fox News is playing clips from CNN\n[noise] and now back to Mike Gallagher\nNine nine and ... for the\n\nGenuine the Mike Gallagher show twenty seven past beyond the president and certainly did respond to this crazy a comment last night on Fox News with Laura Ingraham here's the president said about the GQ writer who said that he was radicalized more people that ISIS check this out there was a woman who\nWas on CNN a short while ago saying that you have\nMore painful than I\nThat was saying I'm saying well that must be some kind of a sick woman when I say the enemy of the people I'm Talking about the fake news and you know better than
