about Esther I knew it very well because the Texas told me at least twice I Know that\nAs star looks\nVery good that's the words that she was she was good to look at so no matter what Esther war she

blue eyes listen in the sunshine and the king\nAnd queen dress and instead of ordering execution what do we really look at this this is the moment it's just a moment for which all those people have

c._e._o. of the national defense university a good morning Dr Parker how are you this morning\nOr good morning it's great to be back on your show\nA Dr Parker road you word is CEO of the east west Institute and uh there's rumors around in the middle East that you were responsible or you were hurting in or or you played a large role in the release\nOf a a professor Andrew Brunson uh what can you tell the American public about that\nOh you know he's with ... sitting at a reduced Tom like among nations and by building truck than any communications which is what we do so we're very pleased to hear that a rubber Brunson released\nAnd as far as very big guy act and we we just got in particular what we're working on a but certainly are happy they release and we're happy they were able to continue our interaction very closely with the church\nWhile I understand you ah have a great personal relationship a with a ... or to Don and uh uh I guess that helped in one way or another and a and a thank you for all Americans for what you got done\nWell thank you were ... were very happy that the the uh the Bronx in his back and we're happy to see the relationship seems to be improving between the United states and turkey right now\nNow you want a new CEO of the national defense university to tell us what's that about\nI mean the the uh national defense university foundation in the end the foundation is formed about thirty six years ago this universe the mission and what they do it you went strategic education in leadership development of us\nAnd our friends now I really senior leadership\nAnd so this is it right into what you were talking about John because what you have a very senior leaders\nFrom around the globe ... here in Washington at or near I and also the join forces stepped college and interacting together over a anywhere from six months to a year long period and this is absolutely key in our relationship says we do or where\nNow you continue to work in the middle east the reason a region and ah there's conflicts now a between Saudi Arabia\nAnd a turkey or are you involved in any way knows well\nThe the Institute I remain on the board of directors a sweat Institute and and the answer to your ... your ... in in any interaction or ... is a ... around the region are very close we have a efforts going on in\nIraq and Syria in Turkey a it really around the entire region there continue to eliminate those\nOh I've taken the position that uh uh what happened to uh to show he uh I mean sometimes\nHappens all the time in Saudi Arabia were there um punishments of of people that they feel a a rush to have wrong doings et cetera et\nCetera um that just\nBeing blown up far beyond what anybody says a paid\nFor and I think when you look at it you have to first ... um he's not a United States citizen eyes are they know anyway and and he he was not killed in the United states or that\nAnd we we certainly look at all of the human rights issues on a regular basis of of what happened or what reportedly happened so um it it blow up I think more than ... people uh in these kinds of things normally do uh but you know that this is getting attention of the world obviously\nUh obviously I think to President Trump is looking for a solution of ah not blowing up a relationship or a between Saudi Arabia so since that set for a\n... and you know more about these things or most Americans is it possible that the king did not know about it and to punish the prince food if he's found responsible\nBut I I tell you I I Would it would be a complete speculation on my art on ... what the king knows indebted now\nUm but I can tell you that it's been a very close to ... you know between the United states and Saudi Arabia for a long time going back to Desert Shield Desert Storm and well before that\nAnd if you look at some of the efforts on going right now to include a hundred and ten billion dollar military equipment fail that we're working with a with the Saudis I think that they nip again that does not mean a return our\nOur head in turn a blind eye on the issues that are purportedly happen\nNow I'm just release you know what goes on in the middle east between turkey and uh she bring the a\nPastor the professor prisoner for two years was he actually in jail what was he just uh how intense as well\nThat's a great question he was actually in prison for the better part of the two years the Trump Administration and many others are private and in a government and in working this for quite a while to get his release\nBack in July the administration that Trump the ministry of human was able to get in removed from the prison and he was just held in house arrest Suzie will to live with is a white and that started in July\n[noise] now do we have to give up any deal to turkey 'cause I remember going back to the Iraq War and uh I'm a ... an older guy a where turkey trucks there's plenty of big and vows to fly over turkey\nWas the deal made with turkey for this release or or was it a perfect\nI had no indication that there would they do is actually a deal struck on reality is that they are in NATO ally there the second largest military in NATO next to the United states um their location matters a lot and and there are other issues out there it can be work now and and quite frankly\nA really since ... that go out to vent intense say they attempted to a couple of years ago what you what you've seen is a a ...\nDrop in the value of the lira and in their economy in General John ... well fine so I think that these kinds of relationships that we're talking right now is olive branch is if you will and bringing the pastor back in I said\nCan only help in in moving forward with the relationship between the U.S and turkey\nI'm totally you know so but we have the conflict in Turkey Saudi Arabia United States is involved a which to show he was there any particular information that the Saudis once it from them\nYou know not not that I Know a ... you have to remember a day or he was not only are reporter but he was he was known to be a bit of it is it in um there are many reports out there that he was tied closely with the with the Muslim Brotherhood\nUh and and so I'm sure there were concerns by the uh by the Saudis over this but the details are are are are still ah I Know at least by me\nOr not to talk for um uh we got about a minute left\nHow food emerging people drinking a cup of coffee on a Sunday Morning which do you want to tell them hey it's high time together a turkey Saudi Arabia a United States how do you want to bring these wants to go to as ...\nWell I think just like they're sitting around they're they're a table on on Saturday or Sunday Morning and ... a talking to their family relationships matter not only inside the house\nBut also around the globe and so you know we build trust as a nation day by day give it out with things like national defense university where you at in international relationship happening a sweat Institute doing the same thing and again building that trust day by day is what matters here\nReal interest rates rise that's just the natural course of things I just don't want that said intervening in a way to raise\nThose rates more than they should be raised and that could smuggler this incredible expansion I'm In a way that that that would cost a lot of jobs\nAre ... Sunday Morning what else would you like to tell the American public before we started out\nYou know I think Trump is winning on trade that's the other big issue John you know uh we've had that Trump has brought us certainly an unconventional Republican when it comes to trade a and and ... what I used to talk to them a lot about trade and you know he he took a tough line and I was uncomfortable with that but I have to say\nIf you look at the situation today it looks like to me like Trump is wedding here\nI'd like you were running a normal but it looks like one in Europe you money Canada yet you run into Mexico yeah and I think the Chinese wanted to make a deal\nI I agree with you now how long it will be aware I what I Do know John is how long it's\nGoing to be for China to come to the bargaining table and negotiate because they're not negotiating now ah and and Beijing but look look at you know I was ever a great time to pick a fight with China\nAnd make them play by the rules it will be right now we've got a booming economy\nAnd if you look at some of the latest statistics on China's economy is not doing so well I mean they're they've been hurt by these terrorists are and they they are going to have to make some real concessions and I will say this you know Donald Trump pretty well I Know I'm pretty well I don't see him backing down do you\nUh uh no I don't see him back down but I think he wants to make a deal to and uh so hopefully makes it before November ...\nThat's going to happen but I Do think we're going to get a deal eventually because by the way Donald Trump is not asking for anything unreasonably just saying let's open up your markets are companies the way we've opened up our markets in your column country\nOr companies are shops stealing our intellectual property shop building up your military and I'm a glass of a way\nThat that uh you know put a pause up some uh disruptions in the piece on in Asia so much\nTrump is not being unreasonable here these are all things that China should do and I think from should stick to his dogs here in the ball is in Beijing's court right now\nSteve board chief economist or and distinguished fellow at

thank you so much\nNow I guess every American this Sunday Morning Scott with Saudi Arabia a secretary my nutrition ah cancelled his trip Saudi Arabia or the tensions are rising a\nPresident Trump wants to lower oil prices but Saudi Arabia is not happy that all of a sudden we're we're talking about them and the way they have lived for a hundred years what do you what's your feeling\nI think this is this is a complicated issue for or of the Trump Administration as well as for the Saudis me what happened what appears to have happened if it's the Saudi Government decided to murder one of the Saudi journalists who'd been\nCritical of the Saudi Government but mildly so who is living in the United states he was a permanent resident of Virginia John\n... uh he's someone who had written who's running for the Washington Post he'd been around for a long long time and uh they're they're apparently murdered him and the most barbaric fashion and the Saudi a consulate in Istanbul two and a half weeks ago\nAnd that's produced a crisis because for the Trump Administration this is a difficult crisis on the one hand the United states depends on Saudi Arabia as this great energy power\nOr to have a relationship with them so that we don't pay more at the\nPump the Saudis are responsible stewards of oil prices secondly the Saudis have been a blocking agent against Iran\nAnd that's an American interests because we think that Iran is a malevolent influence in the world and third the Saudis actually have a good relationship with Israel for the first time in seven decades\nThey don't talk about it much openly either side but the Israelis and the Saudis are working together in the United states is pleased to see that so in the one hand you've seen ... from President Trump talking up the fact we we can't end our relationship with Saudi Arabia but on the other side John\n[noise] you know we are a democracy we believe in justice this was a great crime committed most probably by the Saudi Government\nAnd so I think at some point the United states government has to\nHas to say we condemn this\nWe condemn this murder and there's going to be some kind of sanction put on Saudi Arabia has a price that they have to pay a penalty that they have to pay I think as I listen to Republicans and Democrats\nBut that's where most of our elected leaders are saying and you know sometimes America needs to stand up and say the right thing and do the right thing and leave the rest of the world to a moral judgment and the judgment here has to be this this was a this was a ... a barbaric act by the Saudis\nCan and we have to disassociate ourselves from\n... in ... I agree with you a hundred and ten percent [noise] uh but that's what President Obama did he got rid\nOf a ... we got rid of we got rid of of a Mubarak when we got rid of 'em uh other friend\nIn Libya and this is the way of life they do the Saudis have been living life is a hundred years until you off there there are people they don't like\nAnd\nWhen we got rid of Mubarak can we got rid of Milosevic can we got rid of Saddam Hussein they change the entire balance of power which ended up causing more problems for our country but\nDon't forget when Eisenhower says be weird the middle Terry a dust\nFuel power to the military industrial power corporate America stones prices many arms so for whom do the belt so that's a complex question\nIt's become a problem why we go to Tom and order something for ... hours at a hundred nine three zero nine two seven or ask for ... tell me what\n... are you doing I'm sharing my story dog nine Ninety where was I Know Carlos was my first job and you're talking to a transistor radio it doesn't work that way take out your smartphone to record your video tell what news talk nine Ninety means to you\nThen uploaded new song nine Ninety dot com you might even with an apple eye pad pro in apple pencil huh you know maybe you can get your grandkids to help you\nOut to enter the key word story a news talk nine Ninety dot com listen live in the world and\nGood\nMorning America this is the roundtable contacts he hears Sunday Morning\nA lots of stuff going on in the world and a way this this morning is one of the most than formative people I Know a Sebastian Gorka I he fight much Saturday was with the Trump Administration special assistant to the president or the money Sebastian how are you this morning\n... very well thank you for having me\nHow congratulations by the way I understand you have a brand new book is called why we fight how how how America ... book this book is about and and your feelings or why we fight\n[noise] well my first book different things about the threat of groups like I'll either I says\nThat did very well and now all the spending my time in the White House strategist the president I voted by ... book about all the threats we face Russia China global jihadism you name it ... the president is doing about them and then to re instill in us\nA sense of ... American food he represents in how we got some amazing heroes\nWho you've been there all of this country so I'm amongst the strategic analysis the full story it's a great America there is like right back even K to ... for that she had the enemies to a hundred years ago the shoulders of Tripoli when we were finding the Barbary pirates\nThrough World War two with just deployed marine coalition that an amazing naval aviator who I I feel the meeting a fact that um [noise] read McDaniel Eugene with Daniel who was captured in Vietnam spent six\nAnd a half years in the handle hills that as a prisoner of war and that was released and the last ... and and the kind of a ... we were going through the ... the\nKavanaugh hearings I wrote the story of Whittaker Chambers that man who who was treated like judge Kavanaugh was back in Nineteen forty eight just to illustrate the people that the Democrat dirty tricks handbook is a very very old Guam\nAnd die you know there's been so many problems in the world ah and ah it seems like our state department or on a executive office them in a President Trump Pence's hands throw\nA between the middle east or Saudi Arabia a and a turkey or what's happening to\nThe show he ah in ah with the Saudis you have any opinion on that\nI I Do indeed uh I ... a piece of the hill are able to talk about\nThe fact that the media has doubled to about this ... uh if if it was a you know a real story of a subtle their kid at all it would have to go to the sellouts space to three other Americans who were killed in both ... and so this is about\n... the president and this is a a a narrative they use a facility as the president and his use of the term fake news and circle do the really critically old scrupulous and how to discuss with this person is to show the whatever happened to the little clearly that\nDidn't deserve what happened to him but he's law just some innocent journalist\nEvil as a columnist or an opinion writer who was at a local malls and father who you joined it been like in several keys went to school was it that will close to the ... and the idea that we're not how it was hard to walk without\nThe pieces that were written by the Washington Post about how this letter was a sense of sleep in the ... the suits he was and is a little is he believes in the city of ... of countries in the middle East that will most of them so you didn't lose as to die\nBut the idea that he was some sensitive ... is ... so he's clearly an individual caught between the chill political power play\nOf Saudi Arabia and they ... up to ... to ... on the edge of the water\nSo he was a partners with bin Laden or very close to bin Laden or any\nI mean they weren't Muslim Brotherhood as\nYou know he ... he joined the Muslim Brotherhood of the ... the mother ship with groups like al ... and Hamas come from the wars in high school we were very close to the lab\nSo to question was asked uh if they tortured him trying to get information what information do you think you know we're trying to get out and\nI'd I'd ... I'd like to comment on that because I think these reports about someone talk to a Turkish officials who talked to someone who has an audio that's\nObviously they wouldn't pause lost a in a high school newspapers so\nUh if if the walls truly a hit to this perhaps those that are really good I think this was this was until about interrogation Brits amazed to this is about ... ... who was really proud of his most of the car or are we seeing them out but I I don't want to ...

that they're kind of a lackadaisical attitude that\nWe will see was meant to buy the incumbent presidents policy is ... ... if you like the last two years it's like what's happened to will or won't pay that you have to vote down ticket Republicans and that's that's one of the reasons I wrote why we fight\nThe do the the one I did the fact that ah the Maxine\nWaters or the congresswoman from

days are numbered\nA strange this product to know how to diagnose prevent anything\nBut in addition to that what we want to do is possibly use some natural substances to help augment that antibiotic so that you get well quicker\nWe slow down the progression of the disease right when you come in and were able to do this without all the side effects multiple medications good example would be things like high blood pressure\nYes okay so yes if you need a high blood pressure medication of course we're going to give it to you because one pressures real problem we also have an alternative way to help slow that progression down and you know all about it\nThat's absolutely right and and we should mention so that the folks know that not only do I hosts the show with you but I'm also patient and have been for over Twenty years right and it's interesting because your philosophy is the least amount as you said a pharmaceuticals necessary right because of side effect\nRight there as bad sometimes as the condition and some in some respects they can even be worse because most patients who come to see me have\nMultiple medications is therefore multiple side effect right right and so the idea is you want to make sure that not only are they the proper medications which of course my two physicians would check out\nBut can we reduce your need for them by augmenting those with natural substances like the kinds of things you might get in a health food store but actually our delivery system is much better we use hydration ivy therapies to help deliver these neutral particles directly to the area that is involved in the challenge\nAnd when you say hydration it's delivered via Isaac correct right All right so if you have high blood pressure right and and you are taking care of this particular patient you may have them on orange any rights arguing that and that helps with Rowan blood pressure\nExactly and the question is the idea is when we look at a patient we need to look at what is the therapeutic level of any of these natural substances and one of the things I Want to say to folks out there this is not new concept\nTo spin around you direct you give someone the direct hit of the natural substances visa V. I. V. using hydration meaning the substances in the bag\nUsing hydration as the vehicle to deliver a therapeutic does\nVery much like what is the therapeutic dose of any traditional pharmaceutical take something like a Z pack Jon right what's the therapeutic dose we start with to an end up with three right yes and that's exactly the same mentality that she used in the natural substances\nThe best thing you can do is make an appointment to sit down with Dr Molly fantasia the initial consultation is complimentary the number is eight five six for eight nine zero five zero five eight five six\nFor eight nine zero five zero five that's the number you call them you get the information and again you want to make a point with Dr Molly feel free to do that eight five six forty nine zero five zero five is the number on your host Jon Damasio Dr Molly fantasia is here Dr Mali is a PHD doctor\nThe executive director and founder of innovative medical associates after locations Marlton New Jersey and Delaware New Jersey and throughout the course of today's program we're going to kind of I I guess you would call this the starter course on what Dr Molly does an innovative medical associates Dr Molly and her medical staff\nAt her find nursing staff as well so that's what we're doing today if you have a question about any of this maybe you have a particular medical challenger condition and maybe you just want to feel better and you want to ask Dr Molly how it's done she'll be happy to talk to you about that\nAnd we'll get into some more things as well here on health watch so we're talking about the medical hydration\nAt a very good example and and I will explain from time to time my particular situation and you mentioned are Janine show\nYour doctors prescribe for me a blood pressure medication I been on this for a while and I remember saying to you and your doctor said you know what the blood pressure seems to be high I don't think this particular medication is doing his job right and you and the doctor said to me are Jeanine\nWhat you said earlier are lining yeah each week when you take my blood pressure it's about twenty twenty five point difference now to try to write orange and it\nWell but our Janine in the appropriate does and then the procreate delivery matter yes so again here in our chair you're getting some of the ivy protocols that I developed along with my docks\nAnd sees developments have really helped a lot of people with a myriad of problems not just not just high blood pressure John but for example we have a protocol for people who have\nChronic like chronic congestive heart failure\nSo you know obviously we're very astute and I have two of the greatest physicians Dr ... and Dr Mark test to both osteopathic physician who's eighty me in my delivery systems of the hydration\nAnd I really look at things from the cellular level you know that but they're the guys who helped me actually deliver this on the physiological level and that's really important so open minded folks to know that\nThere's a lot of God's ingredients out there that can help patients so for example we have something for congestive heart there\nWe have we also have used and cut our teeth on an old standby that you know of Caucasian yes and we used ... for high cholesterol high triglycerides\nSometimes a actual I'm blacking for patients and have improved their blood flow twelve percent\nHead to toe and actually ... has been published in the family practice journal about I guess about a year ago saying that it could be could be may be an alternative to some of invasive cardiac so these are the things that we do\nAt your doctors are familiar with what you do actually losing elaboration actually\nDr ... and actually doctor tested this just this week\nTook an ivy took an ivy for Fifteen 'cause he's too busy running around and helping people and Dr ... as you know\nActually has a condition comes into the facility and that's how Dr Catholic it got involved with us yes so not only do they know they've been acutely involved and know the good that can come out of do using nutri suitable properly properly\nAnd that's really important to ... and we're going to say there's several times to the audience understands your philosophy is the least amount of pharmaceuticals necessary\nAnd the new pursuit Nichols take the place of what may you may have used before pharmaceuticals therefore reducing side effects and in many cases it's better for the patient and it helps them with their condition\nExactly exactly and it's about good monitoring and good old fashioned general practice care what you're going to get at our facility\nAnd it's interesting because whenever I Do a show with you and then people say to me you know I heard your honor that's really interesting I never heard of that [laughter] but it's been around for years around for years but it's not\nOne of those things that you know the prescription drugs and the pharmaceutical companies are in our face every day was hundreds of TV ads but it's it's it's\nAnd again you know we love pharmaceuticals there's been new developments in the pharmaceutical industry that have really helped people say cancer for example in some it'd be immunotherapy but one of the things I Want to say is there's also a lot to be said for what is all this new again\nFive to eight five six for eight nine zero five zero five is the number eight five six for eight nine zero five zero five like I said you can call them right now or they will be there well after we leave you at noon this afternoon and you can call him that if you like or you can call tomorrow doctor Mali is in the office\nPretty much the entire weeks you can call her there as well eight five six for eight nine zero five zero five is the number and again the website innovative medical associates dot com that's innovative medical associates dot com\nYou know the fact that we're able to give somebody a little more quality of life is a big deal when you have things like congestive heart failure\nAnd you know about that right John absolutely and you know we know that a lot of people their heart is not pumping at an optimal level and therefore they're not getting blood flow from head to toe so again we can go back to some of the old standbys which are ... and cardiac nutrition\nBut imagine adding all of that with some stem cell\nSo that's what's different is that the number one thing that's different today from twenty two years ago when you started\nNow I Would say there's so many things ways by which the cardiologist traditionally can now come to say that a patient has\nA particular challenge all of that has changed for the better but again standard is still you go in if you're if if they think you have blockages you go in you have a the capitalization and they stent you now\nIs standing a good thing well it's not a bad thing if it's going to keep you alive surely ideas how do we keep those stance from closing and that's where we come in and do a great job with it\nAnd obviously I'm a patient and that's one of the things he says I have yeah because I'm now coming up on almost three years wrote attack right\nAnd I had one hundred percent blockage that ... and ... and then you put me on your protocols and there are some prescription beds of course is one prescription mid they used for this right and so you are protocols are addressing\nAnd they're like taking this they want to know why not why does it bailing out why they feel so bad\nWell there's many reasons for that and some of these things can be dangerous I've seen things from the health food store again\nThat totally inappropriate for the condition that the patient had so I'm not dishing health food stores in fact we tell people will tell you there are good ones out there and good brands out there and we support that they have a real um they have a real need for these types of stores in our presence but\nAgain I Want people to be selective in what they get\nLet's talk about the nice and story remember that I don't know yeah OK for those are listening for the
