races what's at stake what we're up against because quite bluntly I'm tired of hearing well the Republicans are going to hold the Senate but they're going to lose the house is that a foregone conclusion\nAt this point in time we are seeing a very volatile environment so from the outset of the twenty Eighteenth cycle we knew was going to be very competitive\nDemocrats are very energized they want all out of ... that is that is their\nTheir their overall agenda right now yeah what we're seeing with\nTwenty seven days to go is a resurgence of Republican enthusiasm post a Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings [laughter]\nThat is due in large part to Republicans coming back home ones who who might have been a little uh disinterested in in the mid term election but are seeing what the Democrats have planned we're already seeing Nancy Pelosi\nAnd other House Democrats a line up a litany of potential investigations they plan to undertake if they get control the house and we see on a regular basis their candidates talking about issues like\nAbolishing ice undoing the ... tax plan and protecting sanctuary cities if they're able to regain control the house that is what's at stake in this election and I it has a way of turning off independent voters\nIn motivating a Republican base voters\nSo I I heard of it last night on TV made my blood runs cold Kevin McCarthy pointed out Maxine Waters will become the chair of the house financial services committee if the Democrats take control the house\nLike gosh I I I I think that just motivated about three million people to crow crawl across broken glass to vote for Republicans\nIn November to have that doozy in a chairmanship position anywhere I mean we're seeing the difference the stark difference Jesse between the angry mob that is being raised by the Democrats you heard the comments Eric Holder\nHillary Clinton were not going to be civil and less until we when my gosh the the protesters and they are all Democrats Jesse these aren't Republican protesters\nOne hundred percent we don't Maxine Waters is someone who who kicked off this\nA reprehensible behavior up saying that they should go at a cost of the White House officials are cabinet members are Republican elected officials in their in their whole you know near their homes in restaurants at\nGas stations wherever they are is that is the type of rhetoric that's being used by the Democratic party day and that will become a\nKind of common practice if Democrats get control the house that's why it's so important for Republicans to get out there and vote to match that democratic enthusiasm because this is what they want we saw they ... you know you had the\nPotential twenty twenty presidential candidates up on stage you know during the judiciary hearings for Brett Kavanaugh you saw the way that they behaved that is going to take on a more of an emphasis as we move past the mid term elections in it to the presidential years of that\nYou know if you combine that with a a a a house led by Nancy Pelosi in a democratic presidential primary going on they're going to see some really a a porn behavior from the Democratic party if they're able to regain control\nJesse ... national Republican congressional committee we appreciate your joining us other Mike Gallagher show very very much here it is here's the video this was taken by somebody in
