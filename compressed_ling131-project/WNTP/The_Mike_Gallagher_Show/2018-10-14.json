yeah I'm a news though I mean I Know I'm\nGood morning America this is the facts aren't table John catch them or to ship it Sunday Morning\nThis morning we have a very very special guest calling into our show as former prime minister Stephen Harper of Canada\nAnd that was one of the rule is serving a conservative prime ministers out of Canada uh he uh left office a few years ago and he wrote a new book\nRight here right now they're morning a prime minister Harper how are you\nVery well thank you for having me John\nYou wrote a new book that you were prime minister for a long line almost ... almost a decade or how about the new book tell us about uh what it's about your experiences of running a large country like Canada or ten years well\nFirst of all the book the book is about to what has been happening in politics in the last two or three years we've seen Donald Trump we've seen breakfast that we've seen\nThese populist movements in Europe and elsewhere we're seeing tremendous political disruption as what I call it and it kind of parallels that technology technological disruption and other disruption we're seeing in society\nAnd a lot of people are obviously some people are very worried about it a lot of people are alarmed about it I\nI'm looking at this from the standpoint of both someone who advisors um uh businesses and also as a political background and I'm telling people that this changes understandable if you look at a lot of the\nComplaints that the populace are raising of the trade or immigration or markets there not without merit\nAnd as conservatives um you know I chair the global federation of conservative parties we need to adapt we need to make sure people's concerns of being addressed\nAnd I think that can be done and it but we need to do that because if we don't do that we're going to end up with a bunch of socialist running our country which I think is the biggest is actually the biggest danger we face\nNow you are rarely conservative party a and prime minister Trudeau is the liberal party that's for a ... what is the biggest difference recreate it Canada recruiters conservative party in the liberal part\nOf uh gee I don't know where I'd start with that but all of the biggest the biggest is what you would expect um [noise]\nWe're ... he was a party and is a party of low taxes and more emphasis on enterprise and the uh the liberal party is for higher taxes they bigger deficits and a and also um you know more government intervention in the army\nNow uh there's elections coming up in October of twenty Nineteen or what so what what's the political climate well\nI'm optimistic in fairness John I don't kind of comment on day to day Canadian political fares anymore I'm Out of that were party has a new leader\nA Andrew share is doing very well I Would just note that in several of our provinces recently the trend has been very much towards our party\nUm votes Ontario and Quebec the two largest province has just elected right of center governments [noise]\nSo I I'm very optimistic about the direction and Canada but ah as I say my my concern is more or looking at what's happened happening globally in the United states and um you know just very concerned that these Global Trends that we as conservatives take advantage of them in ways that move us forward [noise]\nUh in the United states there's big turmoil yeah between a Donald Trump or who's a conservative Republican and uh the Democratic party is they're kind of that type ... what's going on in Canada\nI look in any democracy at any time in history\nPolitics is always contentious and emotional and passionate but I Would say in fairness and you know in Canada were able to watch developments of the United states very closely\nI Would say that the level of contention in polarization here is something I'm not used to not even used to it in the United states which tends to be more contentious\nA country than Canada but so no look there's passions and and there are many people who like our government may people dislike it intensely but there's nothing like the nothing like the political and social division that I really see in this country and it\nIt does concern me because democracy does depend on people being able to argue with each other rationally\nNow uh we just had a big a fight over tariffs a and a U.S and Canada brother and sister we never fight [noise] and um uh if\nNow and um where can we buy the book you could buy it I guess on\nAmazon you can fight on Amazon ... mobile I assume it's it's penguin Random House signal publication so it's available through the Internet I think it will be widely available in bookstores is well how what else would you like to tell all of America north and South America all the rest\nOf my like I'll just I just want to say a John what I always say when I come here I um [noise]\nAh you know obviously I had the honor to be in what I call in my judgment the best job in the best country in the world that was being prime minister of Canada\nBut one of the things that makes Canada so great it's something my good friend Benjamin Netanyahu once said to me said Canada is the best neighborhood in the world you have oceans on three sides of the United states of America and the other\nThis country as we share interests we share values um we share a an economy were highly integrated you our closest neighbor our best friend are most reliable ally\nAnd uh the book I'm writing here or as international conservative making observations is really designed to uh to see your country succeed and our friendship before\nAnd there was the prime minister when I say God Bless America I always me all of America Canada and United style thank you very much thank you for coming on our show and God Bless America and uh we're looking forward to the next elections or anybody you know running\nWell definitely definitely my country I say it's a if you know any any Canadian twisting

and you I mean you you're there in the middle of the fire and you're the one that's fighting or in in the middle of the the war\nWas uh what is going on in the world um let's start with what are you what's your opinion on North Korea secretary Pompeo a wet year or this week uh do you see a ... blue sky\nI I totally do John and I'm One of two members of Congress coup into North Korea and so it's really a terrific to the the excess of President Trump\nTo say that we've had American ... American Korean American relief or we have a uh the am I a a they remains to be released a we have no more missile testing or over it and no more threat Guam\nEr into over and over again that the level of success and the president deserve a lot of credit along with the ...\nI saw you see that somewhere down the road there will be some blue sky\n... blue sky now and it really is because the agreement that was done clearly state and I urge\nPeople look it up because it was one page it's easily understood\nAnd the very first point was that they would provide for the ... the Korean Peninsula and then secondly or at least have roommates and that's been done\nNow what is your most talented ladies and uh the Trump a British reaction has been Nikki Haley your former governor of your state South Carolina or have you talked about how we should\nKnow John she's terrific and sees a person who has been a trailblazer in history she ran\nIn my home county or as a Republican for the state house into the the thirty year income but\nShe also was the first female governor elected in South Carolina in three hundred and forty years she was the second Asian American governor elect to American history and she's just not a wonderful job at the un but she is a person who\nUm it takes for bold action as she did and then to be a with President Trump or in the oval office the bold actions of determining that she would like to know that the further career\nAs is added politicians at the business world oh you're ... you're not you're not at liberty you say you\nKnow not have done I I the uh the business world and I see a has a sacrifice thing to say that they have the Carolina versus a full time job or to an end to pay ten thousand four hundred dollars a year\nAnd so she has a sacrificing her family's been sacrificing but uh she uh and and the tender age of mid forties or she is a position to earn a living a and a and have a lifestyle that she's so rich they deserve\nShould federal employees be paid more sick to serve their country\nI I Believe I'm On the bats that are a nation a cabinet member\nOr they they really should but hey we know in ... myself to a that we're doing this for public service and you do it for a while and then um hopefully you have an opportunity then\nOr if you're a the age to be able to earn a living but I I don't want to make it where it's dependent on pay a people need to be dedicated and Nikki Haley is truly dedicated\nNow are you very much involved with the embassy opening up in ... uh what is an update on what's going on now\nWell the updated those really grateful on may fourteen to lead a delegation ten members of Congress or to the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem a investor David Friedman is a superstar or we have a and the consequence of that John is very clear\nIt actually has promoted the peace process being led\nBy Jared Kushner and that is that now\nOr the the point and the sticking point of where the embassy should be or what should be the capital of Israel is now resolve now that we need to get on the other issues or to a through a a peaceful procedure provide for a a level of stability in the middle east but this was\nCourageous by uh the president he was told telling you remember that it would be the end of the world\nIf he did that we now see the end of the world has not occurred\nWhat is the area of the world that Trump was you the most\n... it was truly a today a run or they're still finding thing or a terrorist groups around the world they're destabilizing Iraq or they've already stabilize or Syria or they have a missile or with a\nA Hezbollah in Lebanon or Iran is a threat to a world peace and security and certainly a threat to the American people\nAre and so for decades now or the uh the theocratic regime there into Iran has been a threat to a western civilization but particularly to the American people\nUh and look Democrats progressives\nThese are people who want change but me change they don't want to talk about change when allies change they need change in their lives what made the Democratic party the Democratic party what made FDR FDR Bill Clinton Bill Clinton [noise]\nAh we made changes in people's lives that's what Democrats want that's what we did in New York Fifteen dollar minimum wage you can now uh have a different life at Fifteen dollars with a minimum wage for three college tuition for middle class kids\nDon't worry how you're going to pay your kid's college tuition\nBut it can go to a public school tuition free paid family leave so you can actually uh enjoy your family and be there when you need to be there for your family and still keep your job these changes in people's lives and this is progress and hence\nProgressive uh and that's ... ... you know these are not\nProfessional pundits these are people we had a primary in this a state where we had record turn to cheer on I got more votes for governor in the primary than any governor in history\nYou accepted correct that's a lot of people almost triple what came back to the previous times and I guess what they did they come out triple first they wanted to vote for you to make sure you win versus the the extremists ...\nYou know I think they came out for two reasons they came out because they know we have made changes in their lives\nNot because they read it uh from some bloggers fear or so I'm a New York times reporter explained it to them they didn't need any explanation or it's in their life they know what we did and it was an endorsement of what we've done\nI also think at play you have a a a\nIncreased interest\nIn politics and government in general because of what's going on nationwide and I think that's what we were talking about look I Need a Democratic Senate in this state\nTo stop port Washington is doing I Need to elect congressional Democrats so there is a Congress that Democratic Congress that can stop this president\nAh and I needed not for abstract reasons or if you let this president and the federal government do what they want to do a woman could lose the right to choose you could have new gun safety laws\nIt was a everything we've done with the environment is going backwards so these are real life issues John it's beyond\nThe normal ah power politics it this is\nReal ally for people they know what I said they know what I accomplished they know I changed their lives and they know the threat from Washington is very real that's why they came out in the primary and that's my campaign in the general\nUh I'm not talking about just specific individual candidates in the Senate or in the Congress it's bigger than an individual candidate to tell you the truth\nI Need a Democratic majority in the state Senate we need Democratic Congress people to stop what this president is doing\nA and it's not just about Jane and Judy and a pin they are nice and they're good individual candidates but it's bigger than that and that's the campaign\nThat I'm going to be running you when you watch my campaign it's going to be bigger than any Andrew Cuomo war any one Senate candidate or any one congressional candidate because the challenge is bigger than any one candidate and I believe you're going to see New Yorkers turn out\nIn record numbers in November and I think you will see a turnout\nAmong Democrats but I also think you're going to see a lot of moderate New Yorkers which is who we are be they independence all Republicans who come out and vote for change\nNow I was a I don't get impressed that often but I was very impressed how fast that new Tappan Zee bridge was bill now called Mario Cuomo projects I mean there was a record time compared to how long it takes a lot of things to happen or in the sec\n[noise] well thank you you know I feel for that but we need that for my father is just a it's so emotional for me uh and uh my family but ah also John were doing something in New York that this\nCountry has to learn we have to rebuild our infrastructure we have to rebuild our transportation every president of the United states has set a Clinton said Obama's said at a Carter said Trump said he was going to do a one point five trillion dollar infrastructure program it never happened ah\nEverything that was built is\nCrumbling we were supposed to be advancing\nWe're not advancing we're not even maintaining and part of it is government incompetence and people were afraid of government and confidence we change the way we do it here in New York uh know what you don't know in life\nGovernment has no business building a government should not pick up a shovel it's not what we do\nA what we do now is what we call design build government scopes the project but then we we did it to the private sector let them do it and incentive for early delivery a sanction for late delivery could keep government out of it we did that bridge John\nIt's the largest infrastructure project in the United states of America\nAh it really hasn't gotten the attention they\nDeserved because and record half of the political year\nIn record time yeah ah you know they make it right now it's a political year and and the reporters love to write\nPolitics they don't write substance a and it is the largest infrastructure project in the United states shore billion dollars a it's a beauty and it was efficient effective on budget on time\nGovernor Cuomo a a a third this is going to be a third or fourth time third or what do you start watching his toupee problems in New York City a New York city has already\nAnd there's four hundred thousand people suffering there are people are are are lying there they're them that let the people suffer and the education system can you get to help get that fixed and your third time\nOr you know John a\nSearch term my theory is if there are to third time's a charm are\nWe going to continue the construction like the Tappan Zee a knee JFK Airport in Guam to report on the airports upstate we have to focus on the subway and get funding to actually rebuild the subway which is a truly crumbling a as we ride it\nAh the public housing authority in New York City\nIs a disgrace your right of four hundred thousand people we know have children with lead poisoning today a that you'd have lead poisoning this is an issue that we dealt with in the sixties believe it or not the housing authority is primarily federally run\nThe U.S attorney in New York broader than actions before a federal judge a vis city up points the board\nOf the housing authority but it's a federal program and the federal government to step in here I Hope the federal judge makes massive changes because this is not a a a band aids situation\nA it is fundamentally dysfunctional\nAnd as before a federal judge or the state does not have authority but I've been urging the federal government to make a\nDrastic change that is commensurate with the problem I was the former secretary or and I can tell you there were there are no tweets this is a throw out the system\nAnd start over situation\nEducation we're going to for the first time a\nStarting this year and next year we have to focus on getting funding to the poorer schools\nAnd the additional support the poorer schools in the poorer communities need it's not an education problem drawn into richer communities it's an education problem in the poorer communities with the schools are frankly are doing more service has been just education\nEven just calling to my school is is misleading\nI wouldn't call them a community resource center because in those communities are unique mentoring unique tutoring you need a after hours or activities you need evening activities and we have to fund that ah otherwise we just perpetuate the cycle\nSeven eight seven plus if you call the next ten minutes you'll also receive an extra free supply with your order to keep yourself or share with a loved one or a friend so folks as as a really great offered the number to call is one\nEight hundred two one two four\nSeven and eight seven and remember you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr Jim as extra strength ... pain relief formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back\nAnd when you do call in or you will not be enrolled in an automatic delivery program this was a one time order the number to call is one\nEight hundred two one two four seven eight seven and I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred two one two four seven and eight seven\nOkay well if you're just joining us we've been talking with Dr ... she's a natural health expert she's also an expert in a healing with pain pain relief\nBut as we've been talking about how pain has a devastating effect on our overall health and now how her glucose ... and this was a natural solution is a way to really get to the uh uh I guess the root cause that's right of pain in the body um\nBefore we get into that Dr Janet I'm a I'm going to ask you and I know this is hard for you because this is this is emotional but I think it's important\nFor people to understand how you got to where you are today or why what what's driving you and if you could share better ...\nIt was part that a lot of personal pain mhm and pain out that my husband had years ago he had a severe osteoarthritis throughout his body\nAt the same time I had five on my ... right so I was really on a quest to find something all natural to help him have a better quality of life for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time\n... ... let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose I mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on because I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that a new oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right to your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain I took a new oil\nAnd glucose and

water guy you see running around in a truck right now we don't do that we actually have a medical facility\nWhereby we deliver top notch quality nutritional natural products as well as pharmaceutical products thanks to my wonderful medical director and his associates a doctor ...\nAnd Dr Mark test\nSo medical hydration is so people understand those and and and we keep saying it to just make sure they understand it's not drinking water it's not when when they show you need to be hydrated right\nIt's not like the day after going out on a bachelor of ... and coming in because you had a little bit too much to drink it isn't that at all as a matter of fact\nYou know when you talk about medical hydration you'd better talk about a pretty well equipped place because just this week Dr Molly had a situation where a patient\nActually had a reduction in their blood sugar where they start to feel a little ... John you can be sure I had\nThe doctors come out as well as the nurse come out as well as Dr Molly come out and we also had what was necessary to bring her glucose back to normal equalizer she felt great next day I called her she said oh man I got to tell you whatever was in that\nA recipe really really helped me a lot\nSo in that case what did you did she she got\nShe got a little ... during the ivy\nShe notified the nurse who was there the lovely Linden who was tending to her and then of course Lyndon notify Dr casket who was there myself and we came out and Dr Cassidy assessed it and said low blood sugar let's get it on and we actually had\nA mechanism by which we can deliver glucose by squirting under her tongue she came back and about I don't know maybe two seconds ... amazing that is the thing is you got to be well equipped you don't just throw this together is what I'm\nSaying I'm you've talked about that before and that was just amazing but there's there's like ... yeah yeah and and that's not the other words if those are fine\nThey're great ... and God Bless you it's great if you're young and you want to run in there for a quick I. V. God Bless you\nBut you know no matter what you say when you're putting fluids together for a patient it still is a medical a process\nShow the hydration that you may get from a spa my normal life not necessarily be the same one after talk\nAbsolutely one of the things we laugh about in the old days when all of us were all all of everybody in a hydrate ... in a innovative medicine is traditionally train so we all did that in the hospital one way or another and we always laugh about it because what we do is we say there was a banana bags\nAnd can you understand why we call them ... because of the yellow color right and banana bags or just the traditional medical recipe for people who come in\nAfterwards to need fluid and their electrolytes imbalance et cetera but you know ours are so far removed from that I Can't even begin to tell you\nSo some people understand is the hydration that ... that you provide sure is part of an overall treatment procedure fickle direct so it's not just a hydration it's things obviously exactly what it's all part of what you do\nCorrect what we want to do is we want to actually affect you wait a quality of life change for a patient simple as that\nSo if you're coming in and let's say you're fatigue from cancer treatments\nWe want to utilize the particular recipe that will help you get through that the tea without harming what you're doing with the oncologist that's one example if you have an auto immune condition\nAnd maybe it's something that had pain related to it we want to hold down that pain so you can get back to work feel good and\nContinued through your day so there are so many variations of that theme John it's amazing well\nIt's also important that we point out that when you have a patient and and myself as easy for me to talk about because I'm the patient pure and I've been to your praise you for Twenty years that you just don't do hydration no it's like you ... ... right on his of there's a problem\nAnd if you need a prescription we're going to be able to write for Dr tests that can right Dr casket can write and indeed we do now we may not want to write for\nFifteen particular drugs because we know that will that affect your quality of life because the side effects are longer than a park sprint paper or that they wrote the magnet Carter so we really have to look at these things and see what's appropriate for the patient\nOr if you're just tuned in our program was health watch where every Sunday Love until noon here and there's talk nine Ninety under host Jon to mess with Dr Molly fantasia who is the PHD doctor the executive director and the founder of innovative medical associates with two locations Marlton New Jersey and Delaware New Jersey\nIf you have a question for Dr Molly we're talking about innovative medical associates what they do how they differ from what you've come to expect from traditional family practices and perhaps you have a question or you have a particular challenge\nAnd you'd like to ask a question this is a good time to do it eight seven seven nine nine zero WN to pay eight seven seven nine nine zero nine six eight seven that's our number here in the studio\nBut I I suppose that the overall approach that you have\nAn and you've had many cases of success if that's what really different view from additional family probably\nWalking in and getting a prescription directly right because if we can help you by using more natural products that's what we want to do in addition to possibly putting you on a prescription med and in addition will use some homeopathic\nThat are out there that have had thousands of years of success people so it's really combination John and that's the beauty of what we do because it's the nuances of the ... conditions that we really try to focus in on and change for patients\nInteresting story for several months my blood pressure was yeah yeah it was high and and I mentioned to you you spoke to your doctors\nAnd then you said we recommend are Janine right hundred milligrams where I got it all the blood pressure's been Shangri severely improved in the last couple of weeks\nWhile I Want to I Want to talk about that because I Know you had a business trip this week Denver right how did you feel at that altitude\nOr I felt pretty good overall but a little bit of had the breast you\nKnow yes yes yes and that's interesting because again\nHere's the deal given your conditions that some of the co morbidities you have yeah I was a little concerned and I was standing by if you were going to call me going to tell you what else to pick up out of vitamins out there so yeah and of course we loaded you up before you left\nRight that's the key I actually gave you something like more co Q. ten more in a sea which is a particular thing to help with the breathing\nWhile you're out there so there are many things we do for people and that's just we didn't discuss it will\nTell you that's why I wouldn't want you to hear about what you do all the time which was fought I\nWhat the point was that the air you could feel it ... what I was flying that's great John near cardiac surgery and long I'm thrilled I knew you were concerned but I was only there for like three days but it still point was had you not done that you don't mind it why would have been not fly there\nI should I mean that that because actually we we actually had a patient\nWho went out there who came to us after worse and they really had some altitude sickness which was unbelievable again because he had COPD right and that was a real problems that we had the tune them back up because you want it to go skiing out there and I'll tell you what\nHe did he did and I was well into his sixty so I can tell you there are many things that we help people with and again it's a quality of life\n... one other comment about what you and your doctors did the SAT and drugs do you always told me or doctors told me well you know the side effects and blah blah blah and if you need them well\nYou need 'em but I needed them but the pain that the the leg cramping the pain was just so severe particularly in the mornings right and finally again of consultation your your doctor said written used right yep yep and I don't have any more pain so I don't have any more and the and the blood work is good\nAnd the thing about that is interesting 'cause read these rice can mimic stat and so he can get those things on the red east rice\nBut again we were able to reduce the dose of the reddish rice so that it was appropriate by also using key elation some of the things to naturally bring down your lip it's so it was the combination that's really help\nAnd we tell you this because we want our audience to understand that it's not just high Dr Molly can I get some hydration\n... lower now I'm not it's not like that or not at all it's\nIt's a very thorough and comprehensive approach and\nAnd a lot of it is natural products right a lot of that and I we just mentioned too that I've used and you know it's interesting because I thought about this I said if I didn't know Dr Molly and I would be going to a typical family and they're good\n... when the cardiology people go in and they reset\nThe timing on the heart for lack of a better word you know the rich people are having a flood or ... people are having those kinds of things and you have to be careful with this because you can have a stroke people have this problem\nIs the heart you know starts to get out of sequence they can have a stroke so it's a very important process yeah ablaze you but again there are some cardiac nutrition that\nCan help this ablaze Asian again a do its job and I would tell you it's a very interesting thing and I urge anybody to come into the office and see me because I have the data that's been compiled by a very well known physician [noise]\nUm ... ... to tell you that cardiac nutrition is is an extremely important as cancer supportive care [noise] and\nPeople always ask you what do I take what what's a supplement I take for heart\nCo enzyme Q. test we know that everybody hears it all over TV 'cause I knew what form\nAt how many milligrams what's appropriate for the patient and again this takes a little time uh in addition to that we might look at something like a some herbal preparation hostile on has been shown to be very helpful for people with\nUh congestive heart failure our junior are Juno which is an Indian are very helpful so again you've got to learn how to use those things along with the hydration\nAnd is the hydration a combination of those things many\n... and right medic looting including things that are specifically related to the cardiac overall heart cell health for example there are specific cardiac sugars that only work with the cells in the cardiac area\nShow this whole process has changed tremendously big time in twenty two year now\nBig time because I remember it was ... that was the thing was it ... at at our late friend her home we're used to talk about race you know you're right we're a long time he just continually talked about that he swore by that right right\nAnd ... and it's certainly and I remember initially when I got it\nThe ... it really helped my cholesterol level it\nDid so did many did improve blood flow twelve percent right the question is you've got to understand that as we go through life our ... system are cardiac has been assaulted every which way our food\nToxic in the air you name it John she's the our lifestyle sedentary Nash right we go from the car to the office you know why don't you Europeans have the same type of cardiac issues we have you know why they walk everywhere exactly\nWe're sorry we would do that if we would follow the right type of lifestyle changes we can live to be a hundred and twenty\nAbsolutely but we go from the house to the car to the office right back to the car and when you were at home you're on the computer in fact\nThat's an interesting thing because now you know the big push for the young folks is that they have these computer desk that rise up for you to stand up and your computer work\nThat's a good thing yeah that helps ... I mean and that's kind of simple things like that but God has given us a whole lot of nutrients to help us in the cardiac arena\nWhere we're too sedentary is basically what you're saying among others are dead and Terry embed diets\nWhat's the one thing if you want to tell a heart patients or to potentially avoid heart problems what's the one thing you could\nI Would say everybody should walk now Dr Molly walks at least eight blocks a day eight bucks a day I Know and um I really get out there to do it and that's not much really um of course we zoom around the the uh the facility to buy\nYou know sitting down and your job is tough John ... what are you doing you're behind a radio Mike and he said I didn't get the most time\nAnd so that's the key the idea is if you can get out there and do some appropriate exercise Zimbabwe folks I Am not telling you to go out and become a weekend warrior against your cardiology\nA console no please listen to your cardiologist and do something it correctly said good physical therapist who can help do that with you or you know I have Dr Carroll yes uh you can see a an exercise physiologist I mean there are so many things\nBut getting back to the nutritional supplementation there are many out there and with the you know with the new\nApproach with stem cells and by the way John people were getting stamp says I hear this all the time they're flying out to New Mexico they're flying to Mexico itself they're going to you were to get this\nAnd they're paying like thirty five thousand fifty thousand I had a guy came back\nHe's from Delaware and he tells me oh I spent fifty thousand dollars\nA doctor mall you know I'm not sure the stem cells are doing anything for my congestive heart failure I said well what are you doing for your congestive heart failure what have you changed and so we talked about it and I said well I'm not charging anywhere near fifty thousand dollars\nBut I Would tell you that the nutritional piece of the stem cells it's not enough to just put the new cells in you want them to sort of congenial and do their job so you're going to need some nutrition you're going to need some growth factors you've heard me say this ongoing\nUm cellular nutrition what what what can't people understand so we do have a program\nFor life you know what it's like it reminds me of when you plant grass seed you'd better you gotta you gotta put fertilizer you gotta order and got an nurture it right you don't just throw the seeds down\nWell apparently a lot of lot of places are doing that in charging plenty for how I you know we just you know my physicians and myself we just have a different philosophy right our philosophy is we want to look on the cellular level when I'm a biochemist by trade I don't pretend to be a physician\nBut I can tell you that my physicians look at things like the crabs cycle when I'm not going into that folks just look it up that crabs cycle is a cycle of life it's done every minute of every day you're alive if White House cellular function is in your entire body had to do\nThey learn the crabs cycle when they're in medical school\nAnd if something is a biochemist you better now\nAnd I will tell you that that holds the key for lots of this you need to have certain substrates and inhibitors to make the cells work at appropriate levels are functionality that did not show\nOtherwise like I'm Still you know it's not going to do any good right you know you spend or whatever for the stem cells and you don't put any fertilizer on it\n... to talk about here on the show it's health watch every Sunday eleven 'til noon Iran news talk nine Ninety where with Dr Molly fantasia\nWho is the PHD doctor the executive director and founder of innovative medical associates with two locations Marlton New Jersey and Delaware New Jersey you have questions for Dr Molly you have a medical challenge you have an issue\nGood time for you to call in eight seven seven nine nine zero W.
