my right\nOr you know I I I think they've gotten a boost in the last\nMonth and it's given them the opportunity to pick up a few Senate seats or expand our dirty which would be awfully important in the long term I could actually give the Senate as a sort of a bulwark against possible democratic gains elsewhere in the house you know I think the field for Democrats has gotten to\nA lower but I still think the path later on he or she had to pick it up as twenty four seats they need or majority I think that as realistic as it was a few weeks ago so I think the house that we were like a narrow majority for the Democrats most likely MSN and I I see a lot of the pickup for the Republican that with all that stuff you\nKnow I think I'm more optimistic in the Senate because of trends but uh the house I Can't call anymore I used to say it was going to go democratic but the combination and I I Will let out the cabinet I bumped combined with the assault on Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell and the anti piracy combined with this caravan\nOf all sort of solidified the issue set\nIn a very MB unemployment numbers and the earnings report they've all sort of come in for the Republicans at the end here uh Josh and voters notice\nSo here but big nugget summit it'd be sea wall Street Journal poll that we all look at very closely Democrats had a pretty good favorability rating the party image was pretty solid a month ago\nIt's now at negative now which is even lower than the Republican Party image which is pretty remarkable I think you're right that that that attributable to the cabins their their their their tactics off Kavanaugh at some of the more radical elements of the party kind of show in the face of the last month\nI also think that it's pretty remarkable that Republicans have been quite advantage I watched part is better equipped to handle the economy at the largest advantage for any already in the history of the NBC Wall Street Journal poll so that'll be the economy is really the driving force in this election\nBut it definitely has given tropic Bruce and it's definitely give her a little bit of wind a little bit of momentum for a Republican\nAnd let me ask you Peggy Noonan wrote this weekend that one of the great advantages of the Republicans have is the media is so obviously hating on Donald Trump and that there's a recording all in the public at large when they see a twenty four seven media against one party agree or disagree [noise]\nYou know I I think that showed itself in like having a hearing like have you know a little bit when the when the media was bringing up questions about whether he was drunk and college and kind of we're kind of very ...\nI think that I I totally I was actually just in California reporting on a couple of the rational rights of the Southern California and that was all I mean I was surprised the hearing some sort of independent minded voters have have some evidence on how the Democrats and even the press covered or the cabin out here but look I think I think people are so polarized too that you know eat it\nYou know they don't trust them that anything they here they really have gotten to the battle stations that just got to look for the partisan rhetoric out there so I don't think there's a there's a whole lot of truck\nA of the Democratic side towards President Trump's they don't believe anything he says I think a lot of Republicans are trust what they ...\nMy last question my friend Mimi Walters who's a very influential in rising star in a very effective congresswoman or I Can't vote for any more 'cause I've moved to Virginia I Would vote for or otherwise is she going to pull it out it would be it would be stupid not to send Mimi Walters back to Congress she's so influential\nSo I interviewed covers were was actually out there that I wrote a piece that covered that that race several it's a it's a tough one for Republicans as one of the burden for the district suburban district it's always been a Republican but there are a lot of anti a lot of anti Trump Republicans out there\nAre the best hope that Republicans have is that the Democrat is more than any order a law professor who was both with Elizabeth Warren she's too little to the old the laughter where most people are that district and that's the one hope that Republicans up\nI was trying to hear from you can order the Democratic she didn't want to answer any questions to talk about policy and you know Republicans if they're going to win that district they really get up in our data where you stand on issues like health care or um issues that but she says to the left or where a lot of voters or that district\nAnd maybe it works hard I don't know if you've got that but she worked charter their job I mean she goes out and she does every ... out there did you see that\nI give her she she she gave an interview she talked to\nMe the Democrats didn't want to talk of the ... so I you know that that I can only go by what I heard and she's certainly Potter their constituent services that there was a little bit of frustration from some voters but she does go to a halt of wealth or so that that was a concern

a is a concern and the issue of drug prices there's a\nOrigin Frank lunch pull out that revealed the eighty percent of Americans think drug prices are on reasonably high the American people believe drug makers are putting profits ahead of patients do you know Americans spend forty percent more on prescription drugs and Canadians\nAnd that our medication and prescription drug costs just keep ... guy rocketing farmers spent more money on lobbying than any other industry in America over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars worth the American people believe that the system is rigged\nAnd it's rigged because of the big drug makers undue influence with their lobbying dollars\nYou know the fact of the matter is the monopoly pricing power the drug makers can only be countered by action in Congress drug makers have\nTo be held accountable there needs to be accountability but the skyrocketing costs of drug of our medications Americans want accountability drug pricing and we want Congress to take action\nThe prevailing sentiment that we've seen all the polls is enough is enough is enough already Americans want these solutions to prescription drug affordability and want them now it's time to hold the drug makers accountable put the patients ahead of profits\nThey have their lobbyists and there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories that are votes\nTime to end the drug makers monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once and for all the patients ahead of property we will be telling you how to do that in the days and weeks to come you're going to be very impressed with this partnership that we are proud to roll out with you now that's all coming up I promise a and you'll find out or\nAs we do this or that a great call to action for you as well she has some concerns about this NBC a Wall Street journal poll which I think is very encouraging showing President Trump at a forty seven percent of ratings higher than Obama was during this stage of his presidency and twenty ten Haiti's what's up\n[noise] a textbook aren't sure I'll just just occurred made when you were talking about that that

and God and the Democrats got slaughtered in the reserves does that concern you at all\nOh my gosh Ben guys he was a blip on the radar for the mainstream media are you kidding me the only people that were covered Ben ...\nWere were conservative media outlets that are that bothered or dared to go up against the Hillary narrative on that the media gave that a big pass it was a giant yawn an Obamacare for the mainstream media was a you know like a curing cancer\nThey thought that was the greatest thing in the world no not even not even a little bit no comparison\nNo comparison whatsoever they're usually the polling numbers though and I I Want to go back to the story about and this is really interesting analysis from of all places CNN this is a\nAn analyst or analysis rather from a CNN reporter the house forecasters the news the Democrats win two hundred and twenty six seats\nAnd the house majority Republicans will only when two hundred nine seats the forecast percentage and this is CNN talking now [noise] although we haven't generally presented a percent probability the model that we have\nShowing that Democrats hold the house I mean take over the house\nIs about Seventy two percent chance\nSo Harry entering over in June and says\nIt's not as if all hope his last for Republicans indeed I Would point out that it's important to watch the margin of error it's still gives Republicans a decent chance of maintaining control again remembering that the model gives Democrats are about Seventy two percent chance of winning control the house\nThat's among the lower chances than most models do but it's in the general ballpark he asks\nDo you know who else had about a Seventy two percent chance of winning\nYou guessed it Hillary in twenty sixteen\nHe says it's not too difficult to pay the scenario in which the Republicans maintain control of the house do maintain control the house rather let's say Republicans when all those seats where they are favored as well as the streets were democratic candidates\nLead by about a point or less industry and in forecast that would leave Republicans with two hundred and twenty feet\nTo Democrats with two hundred and Fifteen seats\nSo to ... to rule out to say that there is no no chance in hell that Republicans can control the house some it's not really accurate what even CNN says there's a scenario\nHere where
