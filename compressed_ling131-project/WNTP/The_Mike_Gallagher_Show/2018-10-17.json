eight ... voice some clarity for millions of America those old office\nWas his Democratic party was if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or is it ... it is starting to\nShow owned by the most famous man on a plan\nAnd you've been grade Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot coms studio Mike\n[noise] we've had a comment from Hillary Clinton about threatening Americans would say [noise] you know\nIf we win in November civility can return of course are inherently threat is that up to the point of the midterm elections there is no civility when you know people go low Democrats kick 'em [laughter] and of course the other\nPart of that an implied threat that inherent threat is that if the Democrats don't win on November the sex which like it or not is a more than a distinct possibility they're never going to be civil I guess they're never gonna\nEver have a civil adult\nExchange with those with whom they disagreed and then the law comes President Trump and he called Stormy Daniels or space in a tweet yesterday cue the righteous indignation cue the screaming cue the yelling\nHow dare he I mean what a shocker President Trump called somebody a name we haven't heard that in two years have we\nLindsey Graham I saw him on TV this morning saying he's the president he shouldn't do that now the first thing when Senator Graham said who is a staunch Trump defender and reporter and streams and supports the president of the president's agenda to do right by the American people which I think\nAll these should Americans should should be the way that's the way most decent Americans should feel Lindsey Graham started by saying he's a fighter remember she has shed awful things about him\nNobody ever notice is that nobody ever remembers when he call somebody a name they have shed plenty about him\nPreviously and that's what people mean about a fighter here's a here's our Ari Fleischer\nHe was on Fox News paddling because just cut number eight or here's Ari Fleischer shame that how Trump hurts himself when he calls a porn star like Stormy Daniels a name like horse race here's cut aid from Fox News and brave you\nKnow center of this is where the president does his own worst enemy\nHe's in the middle of a victory and he takes it down if you're not just by engaging and that kind of unnecessary rhetoric doesn't need to call anybody horse face you just don't do that when you're the president or reminds me in some ways of the twin he put out about Mika Brzezinski [laughter] you know it's just the president can counterparts so hard he often his himself\nAnd that's something he's been actually pretty disappointed that for the last eight to ten twelve months and here is again returning to that type of mistaken over Kuwait I Wish she wanted to gauge like that it's just diminishes what it is a proper victory a set of hitting home runs that headed up\nNow I I don't think there's gonna be disparaging about our our Fleischer I think he's a nice man I met him a few times and he served of course in the Bush administration\nI'm so he's a an establishment guy he knows the establishment world very well but don't you find it fascinating and again I don't mean there's just respectfully towards Ari Fleischer but isn't it isn't an intriguing to listen to a hundred and that's what ... is now\nHe's like he's like me I mean he's ... he's a guy with an opinion we all have\nSome of them have some of us have platforms whether it's already a appearing on Fox News or meet with the radio show we're we're we're basically just guys and gals with opinions\nSo we are\nWe're not we're not really that we're not certainly an elected leadership were not in the government\nWe can impact people I guess I suppose it's fair to say we can change hearts and minds but in the scheme of things we're certainly not as ... we're certainly not as important as the leader of the free world don't you find it fascinating that Ari Fleischer thinks he can tell this phenomenally successful president\nHow he was making mistakes in other words those who\nWrites or who opine can sit on the sidelines and say oh you're making a mistake you're wrong here for doing that\nBush and I wouldn't call a woman horse race I admit it I'm not like Donald Trump I don't have this kind of personality frankly most of us don't\nThe guy I keep calling him as a ... call him the beach forget naming the the the limousine the drives that he drives around in the stretch Cadillac limousine called the beach that's the secret service nickname he's the beach\nBut here's rule is kind of simple you come after me I'm going to go back after you tenfold I don't care if you're a woman\nI don't care if you're a man I don't care if you're a gold star family I don't care if your Mother Teresa I can see him going Mother Teresa a name if she said jumping derogatory about him every\nBody he attacks\nEvery body he calls a name everybody he just marriages has this very to Jim first\nAri Fleischer knows that Lindsey\nGraham knows that that's what Senator Graham and when he started out the clip I don't know if we do we have the what was your grandkids somewhere guys I just saw kind of rushing around in the hotel room this morning a here in Florida on uh on TV\nReligious said he's a fighter he's a fighter but he ... he shouldn't do this you shouldn't say that when he was the president\nOr we're not going to accept the fact that he's not going to do things that\nTraditional past presidents have done me while\nI don't know there's a couple of pieces of news you might find interesting if you're worried about the president calling a porn star a horse race\nBut you asked his back on top is the most competitive country in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand and eight it's an index produced by the world Economic Forum America climbed up ... one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries\nWere now I had a Singapore Germany Switzerland in Japan we are the most we have the most competitive economy in the world and the fact of the matter is it is likely due\nTo all the economic policies the terrorists that are starting to pay off more good news about the terror of the terrorists are controversial we can have that debate I get it All right to have the dialogue\nBut the United states steel Corp workers or about to get the biggest wage increase in at least six years under a new deal to do she had with the company and according to Reuters\nThat's a sign that the games from President Trump's clamp down on foreign imports are starting to trickle down and impact\nThe American workers told he cares about American workers so he cares about American companies solely cares about Americans wow what a what a novel idea an American president worried about American workers\nOh wow wow it's been a long time since we've seen that it seems\nWages were frozen in the last contract with US Steel\nPittsburgh based company\nTrump's trade policy coupled with a strong economy has sent domestic steel prices shoring helping US Steel posted nearly sixty percent increase in pre tax brackets in the June quarter now the left they hate that they hate companies making money\nThey hate companies passion that profit onto their workers\nBut normal Americans normal people appreciate the fact that the thousands and thousands of US Steel Corp workers who are about to get the biggest wage increase they'd gotten in six years are thrilled with that news\nAnd guess what that's due to that's due to\nPresident Trump's economic policies including the tariffs including international trade including domestic policies that are making a huge difference so while the media\nGets all hyperbolic and hysterical about something like\nThe president counter punching a porn star who he defeated incidentally in the courts remember this week and the reason there's been such animas here's a court of a federal judge ruled that Stormy Daniels lawsuit against the president tweeting about her\nHer defamation suit was thrown out\nAnd she has been ordered to pay his legal fees which according to the president are substantial [noise]\nThat's why this has got this got such contentiousness around for a while the media slapping about horse race [noise] name the the horse race name [noise]\nThat it's not a surprise in fact I don't even think people are all that shocked that he called Stormy Daniels or set or space or whatever Steve says he's greatly offended Steve I hear your very offended at President Trump's calling Stormy Daniels horse race\n[noise] oh yeah at first I Want us to keep up the good or a light you're like I just thought that brings us these thanks yeah what's\nWhat's also thought this is a that a Trump solve the horses and all the women that old and loved horses\nAll right [laughter] right Steve nearby tip your waitresses they will be here all week try to roast beef\nAnd then he died intelligent conservative talk [noise]\nMike Gallagher stuff in the fall [noise]\nMine Gallagher incidentally that um the movie first man a little a post script to our\nLittle volatile conversation with Mark Davis who didn't do that well at the box office it actually did not it had an estimated sixteen point five million dollar debut weekend\nSo we didn't actually do a shade better than the weekend opening up goose bumps to haunted Halloween and they're trying to figure out why well maybe people heard that they didn't show the planet of the flag\nBut for an independent film gods now did great this is the movie the story that the left doesn't want you to know about and it's small wonder not a big surprise that a guy like next year she was the director of the film and oh and one of the actors\nLove love love this guy if you see this guy on Twitter you think Trump is abused [laughter] [laughter] you can't hold a candle\nAnd I urge you to go to a computer and watch he was like oh gosh I got to do on this on video were sky being on TV as well as audio but I Want people to see this guy because everybody knows him he's one of the most celebrated character actors I think of Hollywood I was in the Oscar winning\nThe shape of water a well he's got a credit list as long as my our most welcome to the Mike Gallagher show the one and only mix seriously Mick again as I confirmed to you on Twitter it was last\nSanders there my producers fault that he called feel um and and the directors and not you but my humble is deepest apologies for his mistake my friend\n[laughter] that's that's quite All right Mike and thank you for following at a time honored tradition of throwing the help on the bus I Do that\nUnless you do it we all do it loses ... over I'm not going to look bad especially on Twitter of all places hey Nick at first of all congratulations on the I don't\nWant to get your take before he talked about guys now I just played a clip of\nA an argument I had with a dear friend of mine a fellow talk show host at a ... Mark Davis said about the about first first man okay you heard what what's the next year she take on I mean listen to they have taken three seconds and shown\nThis iconic patriotic moment of the flag on the lunar surface I mean I'm Sorry I Am I being am I being hypersensitive or you think I'm right on this\nWell you know granted I have not seen the film yet but um I I Would say that in uh Nineteen Ninety eight I did\nA mini series fiscal from the moon on HBO show it was very clear in many serious that entire reason that we went to the moon\nWas show that Americans could beat the Soviet Union there was one hundred percent the entire point of going to the moon was to make sure we got there before Russia because we didn't want the U.S has started making ... so that it seems to me like a an intentional\nOmissions although as I said I have not seen the film yet\nAnd I don't really want to ... I read about it and I read enough about it whether they had Ryan Gosling and say well\nYou know Neil Armstrong didn't really think he was an American hero bats so there was obviously a concerted effort to to not show that anyway if you're right I mean let's let's move on I", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Philadelphia", "day": "17"}
