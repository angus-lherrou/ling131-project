argument that all these Republicans were surging\nIt does so first of all the headwind for you know the party if if the\nRepublicans control the house in the Senate and the presidency [noise] the typical number of seats lost in such a campaign is twenty five twenty five would flip the house or\nThe in in in a according to Gallup in a in a year in which the president is unpopular and see the Trump is unpopular that means he's about fifty percent\nAnd nobody gets much better than that these days right but then the average will be thirty seven percent nobody's predicting that right now\nNow the election may well break one way or the other they often do but for the last two weeks as you point out the Republicans have been strengthening and isn't that odd shouldn't there be that's I think that's one of the reasons why there's furious a reaction from the far left\nFrom their point of view this man was unacceptable and everybody should see it by now\nBut you know Rick Scott's very close in Florida and the news this morning is Trump is on his way back down there again yep that means Rick Scott wants him to come\nSo yeah I think that uh it is a dog fight this election I don't think we know how it's going to go\nAnd uh I think it matters very much which is a question you were asking because if you ... since any weapon can you know Paul Ryan pointed out that eighty percent of the bills they passed and they passed a lot of them were bipartisan bills\nWell ... thank God for that and it's it's the same phenomenon is the fact that most Supreme Court cases are decided by overwhelming majorities most of them nine to nothing I think right\nBut but at at an all of the difficult cases and all the cases that raise questions of which what is the direction of the country we are deeply divided\nAnd the house will be used as a weapon to fight the administration if the Democrats take it and then if you want that and that's what you should vote for\nAnd I got to go back to the end close on that is what you just said the media is deeply invested in the idea that President Trump is bad and should be rejected\nTherefore if he isn't repudiated his party isn't repudiated in either house but certainly if it isn't repeated in both of them\nThe media will be face to face with the fact that they are not representative of the country they think they are representative Bob and they are not leading the population in the way they think they are entitled to lead and I think that is a source that is the bottom line is that people feel\nToppled from their purchase a power\nYeah and that's been a problem with Trump for a long time but that's not a particular Trump problem just remember it became since the Nineteen sixties and not before by the way\nSince the birth of centralized bureaucratic administrative rule a different kind of rule from constitutional\nThe path to political prosperity has to be the candidate of change and to run against the establishment in Washington\nAnd they have become increasingly unpopular with time and they've reached the peak now right and and we we don't we don't just say the Congress is unpopular\nThe bureaucracy is unpopular and the executive branch is unpopular and the media is unpopular everything in Washington DC is unpopular\nAnd and what Trump did was he managed to Marshall that into a presidential campaign and if you look at the campaign to the Republicans who succeeded Reagan\nOr they they all ran as enemies of the establishment although the to name Bush are the only ones who won after Reagan until Trump\nFreezing news breakneck face this is Mike Gallagher show\nWe're not going to make America great again it was never that for a\nWay that we've got a\nCrucial midterm election coming up in

give you an example of somebody who doesn't want Republicans to win the is a former Republican but now because she is a star on MSNBC he caters to the left\nAnd this is what Joe Scarborough literally said about the anti Semitic\nMassacre that occurred over the weekend in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at a synagogue or a synagogue there I Want you to let the sink in\nAnd recognize the type of people who don't want Republicans in control in Washington DC here's an example heaps of despicable\nUgly nasty\nHorrible example of somebody who wants to the Republicans to lose in next week's mid term election this was tremendous NBC\nAnd grave you\nPeople on Fox News at talk about the caravan as if this is a big election issue now what's ... I Know there were a thousand miles away [noise]\nKnow that the last caravan that they ... frenzy about actually only brought fourteen or by the end of the care of and they know it's ... [noise] and there are spreading hatred\nOr across America\nAnd and ... at the end of the day Mika again inspiring\nPeople like miss Pittsburgh mass murderer\nYou're showing me 'cause I think people like you and me inspired the man in Pittsburgh to massacre eleven congregants of the tree of life synagogue\nThey think the people on MSNBC or old all a completely and entirely blameless for this so called tone in America\nWe're in such a weird dangerous period of time\nPeople like this jerk Joe Scarborough and his fellow jerk Mika Brzezinski influence millions of people people that think they're in the know their celebrated their they are are lifted up\nAs intellectual heavy weights inside the beltway just just letting us happen letting us know the way it really is on Fox News page fired a madman\nOr try to Haiti madman incidentally which had to really ticked off you're showing me if you had on my hat\nThen their day could have been complete 'cause they're still not finished celebrating the fact that the guy who sent out the mail bombs is a Trump supporter they just love that they've sunk their chief that I didn't I\nJust took this business district which\nIs an evil push through the sickness that some of these people have and they are people who influenced other Americans daily with that but you know here's the irony of irony\nThe\nElites in the media all wringing their hands\nSupposedly worried about the tone that could lead to a male bombings or synagogue shooting\nPeople care about the tone that code the code is this president rolls up his sleeves\nAnd fight and they don't like it\nHe has knocked over the establishment apple cart and they don't like it so they're never going to miss a chance to blame Trump and his supporters for everything that goes wrong in this country the Washington Post literally Rowley even article recently\nSaid you can't compare Trump and Hitler because\n\nPresident Trump is far worse than Hitler they said that I mean last can finally at the headlines I when I saw it at first I thought it was a joke it was a goofy was one of those you know onion kind of no no they really said that\nOne man was a murder is horrific monster or the other one was a con man they were talking about the murder is horrific monsters Trump and the common man was was Hitler they reduced Hitler did just a con man usually Trump's worse than Hitler\nI even respond to this kind of stuff they want to talk about the tone but they don't own any of it they called Trump a traitor a racist I'm massaging the they call the monster\nThat Columbus Day every day every hour of every day is relentless it is on ending and they won't even have the intellectual honesty to say well we can be considered part of the problem too were part of it if there's tone that semi where oh no I didn't even\nCome up with Fox News Fox News\nThere have voices on its air support President Trump CNN doesn't MSNBC done ABC doesn't ... none of them they don't
