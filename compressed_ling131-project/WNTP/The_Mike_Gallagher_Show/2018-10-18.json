here and thank you for listening\nToday I think it's useful for me to introduce you to new emerging voices every now and then one of them is Scott Galloway\nYou heard earlier on this show this week Alan Greenspan emerged to talk about the wonders of Amazon and out is creative destruction personified well Scott Galloway does not agree with that he is the author of before\nMost recently a forty five minute talk on the future retail but Savage Amazon I always tell people I own Amazon I Love what it's doing for me as a financial matter but I Am worried about big tech Rob Galloway Welk on Scott Kelly welcome to the program um what do you make a Twitter controversy involving Louis Farrakhan is away and that is\nA time to 'em and and I used to be with you so I think it's a it with respect to Twitter and Google or I Believe these companies have warmly embrace a the the margin the celebrity and the influence of media companies but they seem to be allergic to the responsibilities\nOf the fourth estate and I think that ah most of these examples are has actually demonstrate one thing and that these companies um don't want don't want to acknowledge that they're not platforms that immediate firms and that they are responsible for their content\nAnd the responsible for ensuring that these platforms aren't paying weaponized so\nI'm generally on the side of of of thinking okay we need we need to hold these companies are the same standards we tell the other media companies do for decades or or even centuries now\nI I spent much of my MSNBC show talking about the need to regulate\nA Silicon Valley and its bags that I read in the New York post your quote I Believe our society is effectively going through this very uncomfortable transition that his bad very bad for America bad for the planet\nWhere we no longer worship at the altar of character and kindness we worship at the altar of innovators and billionaires and I said a man and we've got to do something or this is sort of like the age of the railroad billionaires as it is an age\nOf tech titans your effectively uncontrolled and Franklin for his book world without mine scared me and now you're preaching descent but I don't know what to do do you have a proposal what to do\nYeah I I don't think the world is what it is I think the world is what we make of it and I think initially I think we need to America how proud history of when a company turns into an invasive species and starts killing small companies and the crib them prematurely euthanize a big companies that are better taxpayers and better employers we move in\nAnd we break them up it doesn't mean they're evil it doesn't mean the bad people it doesn't mean they haven't we haven't benefitted from them or we haven't been net gain or the people at ma bell weren't even the people the railroads were evil but when we have one company Amazon the controls fifty percent\nOf all the commerce when we have one company the controls Ninety three percent of whatever content you see after you declare your intention is search and that's Google when we have one company or that is responsible for eighty percent of time and ask\nWhere we spend eighty percent of our time and found on I found that Facebook it is time to move in and break these guys up competition is the answer to I'm actually not a regulation guy and regulation has unintended consequences but it is trying to oxygen ate the marketplace issue we need voices like you come to the light we need these companies\nBroken up and we need to do a side with the macho initially people have sort of a gag reflects that if you talk about breaking these guys up and makes you somehow a socialist or worse Europe than it is very Americans and moving on big companies when they have become an invasive species and we are at that point market\nWe when they are they are information trust it out and and and trust busters are needed I Am particularly appalled that Google is selling the instruments Wichita tearing control to China\nAnd I don't think people understand that would be like selling weapons design that the crop iron works in in Nineteen thirty three it is it is really a remarkable access John Bolton told me last week he thinks we need to go to export control but maybe break up would do it although they wouldn't stop that Scott Galloway\nI'm not sure that it wouldn't show in the case of Facebook you literally had the G argue weaponized the object of our affection Facebook can make this this weapon in our face and\nI mean the the flags here we are not only rag read they were they were you know ... Russia paid for these ads trying to reach\nAfrican our society would rubles and Facebook decided to ignore it and didn't want to didn't want to understand it just as just as the tobacco companies had a difficult time connecting tobacco with cancer social media is gonna have a difficult time connecting unfettered content and not spending their advertisers\nWith bad things I think if you broke up Facebook into for companies Facebook what's that been surrounded messenger one or more of them would decide that to appeal to advertisers\nBecause there was greater competition they would make a requisite investments to ensure their platform would not be weaponized by bad actors there's a lot of advertisers who are\nCivic minded and would like to not advertise on Facebook right now they don't have any choice because it's a do awfully Google and Facebook command two thirds of all digital marketing so competition is absolutely the answer\nHere Scott Galloway where do people find out more about it obviously they can buy your book before but what do you run a website as well\nAs you think that's a generous question they can look at me on YouTube I Do a weekly series got winners and losers in my Twitter handle is profit Galloway\nBreaking news at breakneck face serious yourself might show\nWe're not going to make America great again was never that\nWe've got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ...

last time we were on stage together somewhere is that there is no deep state [laughter]\nWell there's no deep state and I said how can you say that we mean there's no deep state now there's no deep state and I said what you think you let's pick or let's take a survey of the audience and see what they think\nAnd at the end of the day the audience of course started brewing I said now you they're

heels of other high profile leak related prosecution under the Trump Administration and this just cracks me up you know it's it fascinates me the stuff is so\nPainfully obvious and yet even great mark why is people like you could be stubborn and not let facts during the way of\nAn opinion I don't know we got a lot to cover today we want to welcome you to Tampa one eight hundred six five five Mike

course there are people from within who are trying to stop this president Robert shaving his goals of course there's a deep state there should be no doubt there's a deep state\nHow do you not understand that meanwhile as we get closer to the midterm elections\nThe Democrats seem to be getting crazier and more violent\nI saw Lindsey Graham last night on TV said he was spat upon the scary

Kavanaugh until she turned the sound off and saw his testimony and just looked at his facial expressions and decided to vote no\nJust because of that\nI mean we're in crazy bill and I'm just afraid
