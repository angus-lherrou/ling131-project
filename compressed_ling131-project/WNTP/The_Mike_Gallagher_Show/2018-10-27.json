Chris welcome back to the show\nThank you so much that it's always a pleasure to have a great conversation with you\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly it can be daunting you know with all the different supplements out there not Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this decides its good multi vitamin and some fish oil maybe a few other things\nGo into the three super high nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nWell pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called ... they are a troll and apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigate that they use in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor ... I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza there a trial I worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and Chile and South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity that investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that green tea\nKirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human there was very ... why did you want to combine this read there's always a method to your your madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a\nSynergistic effect they make each other work better you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason not to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and\nThat's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines and the research especially on this green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what you've seen recently in the press I Know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti accident activity and whole blood glucose ion you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume they don't\nActually wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants\nWhich we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nIn addition it has a specific fat oxidation property said actually\nBurn fat I'm not suggesting that you're going to lose twenty pounds in a week but I Am saying that this is going to help your body to metabolize fat more efficiently\nOver time taking a green tea extract can help you to have a better fat to lean muscle ratio so from a weight control standpoint this is very good news additionally green tea\nHelps to stabilize blood glucose or blood sugar and unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increased wait\nSo by stabilizing blood sugar you have an effect on weight control in weight management so it's really quite remarkable stuff you need enough of it we've got enough of it in green T. C. R. it has to be the right extract we've got the right to extract but the science is there for healthy weight management\nRight now Chris you see that with charities formula it provides you with about three cups worth of green tea in each to Capitol serving of these cutting edge liquid soft joke so you know the green tea is concentrated benefits for energy for heart health for alert and it's just too\nSoft gel caps plus you get the Kirk human and the ... too so it's easy you call your daily short cut to better health explain this idea of a healthy shortcuts and explain some of the top benefits as well\n[noise] well I mean you could for example drink three cups of good concentrated green tea each day eat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor accrued\nAnd drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of three of the biggest superstar protective health enhancing nutrients on the entire planet so when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that\nYou can get in a good liquid soft gelatin capsule what you'd otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine and murder now in this new green T. C. R. formulas and purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to you I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joined comfort and even for brain yeah\nI especially like\nThe liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify in Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment so we need a functioning super healthy\nIt's a very strong liver and and we know that hurt him in protect liberate detoxify deliver it keeps a strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart it's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint we have in numerous bolt studies showing\nOverall improvement in joined health and relief and stable inflammatory activity\nBetter joint mobility as a result of taking ...\nI like the brain protective studied says well I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind and Kirk human delivers all this so I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware pat but most people are not going to eat\nEnough rock tumor Rick route to get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated ... extract\nChris I don't want to get to technical here but these anti accidents in green tea or classified as police females and they really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists but in his green T. C. R. formula there's more it's got the green tea it's got the cumin the risk berets role to be talked about\nPlush grape seed extract pine bark bio flab annoyed vitamin C can you talk to me about this array of really super anti accidents and Polly females that you put in the formula\nOkay we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here grape seed extract in pine bark extract\nBoth contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds that not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels and the skin\nSo we put those in there for extra boost in antioxidant activity additionally the bio flab annoyed and hence the overall activity of vitamin C.\nAnd vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen\nIf we put in grape seed extract\nPine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C. we realize that we would have an orderly superior formula and just to reiterate pat I Want people to experience dynamic health and this formula the green tea the our will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nBy Christian I Love this green tea she our combination formula and remembered the CPR stands for Kurt human interest spiritual what kind of result skinned people expect to see what can they expect to feel once they start taking this formula\nI think that people will feel greater joint mobility and comfort I think they'll feel more energy because these ingredients also help to stabilize and maintain natural healthy blood sugar control\nI think they'll have more sustained energy throughout the day and I would just suspect that people will have an experience of greater vitality\nWhen you detoxify the body when you have a more highly functional immune system you just feel more energy and better overall it's kind of you know like those days when you get up and go wow I feel great this is a while I feel great formula\nNow Chris the green tea see are limited history to provide you bought three cups worth of green tea in each to cancel serving plus you get the anti accident equivalent of several servings of fruits and vegetables plus\nYou get the risk berets role equivalent of several servings of red wine and the joint comfort in brain function benefits of the curriculum and I mean while the only one formula in the last two minutes talk to me about this short cut to better health and why you want everyone listening to this program to call now\nFrom that complimentary bottle of green T.

dollars annually that many of you might be facing and you're retired years we're talking about it\nWith Ryan floor of her desk all financial network Ryan welcome back thank you so much mom or dad grandma and grandpa they'd like to see\nTheir money taking care of others their loved ones they might want to build a legacy they might want to basically not be a burden to their loved ones but the flip side is they don't want to see their money eroded off of somebody helping take care of them so they may opt for a roommate\nBut then what tends to happen is it creates a lot of anxiety and emotions for the kids who come to see mom or dad grandma and grandpa sharing a room with somebody because you're not get you don't sound like college you get to pick your roommate\nOr your friends you get what's available to you\nAnd I talked to somebody not long ago who just couldn't take the cast of characters\nThat were family members of the room mate of their loved one who was there all the time TV on loud aggravating Graham pop\nNot a good scene so it creates a lot of anxiety a lot of emotions and stress for those that are helping take care of those loved ones who took care of them their whole life so\nHere the action items for today think to yourself what would you like your life to look like when you might not be able to but your own shirt maybe\nThere's your mind starts to split your physical ability slips you need assistance with daily living care bathing using the bathroom getting dressed wouldn't fire him it do you want to take place in\nWhat type of quality of life do you want from that where are the priorities in that and I often say do it now\nBecause later on if you avoid it and something unforeseen or unexpected happens maybe it's a stroke maybe it's an illness maybe he just mentally slip quickly\nAnd your loved ones are so busy they don't catch it and then all of a sudden everybody's reacting emotionally to try to help\nAnd many of you have told me you don't want to be a burden to your loved ones so to think about it today and to do something today is very important but you might say hey protests go how can they even think about it to that you just gave me numbers that are going to break my bank so let's begin with Ryan what some of the\nTools that somebody could use today in planning for themselves specifically you know insurance well you know long term care well you know we knew what he was well what's happening in that space that can help people covers some of the cost I'd like to start with that\nLong term care insurance hasn't been around all that wall so nowhere near how long life insurance has been around so at the very beginning of the long term care landscape insurance companies really didn't know what to charge\nAnd they picked a number and they were way off and they found that it actually costs way more than we expected so the first thing that you see is huge increases in prices over the last ten or so years that\nHas caused a big problem for people who don't already have insurance for people who already had it before all the math was figure it out and the prices went up really high most of those people are at a pretty good space and their ... their policy will serve them well\nFor people who don't have insurance but are interested in and getting some you have three basic options you can go with what we would call traditional long term\nCare which is pay your premium it'll cover ... cover long term care for you for X amount of time for X. amount of dollars the plans are very flexible and and they can be designed to to either\nPay for some portion of the care or pay for all the care if you if you can swing the premium it can pay for all the care very likely the alternative that you have and and the alternative exists because in traditional long term care\nYou might pay your premium for Thirty years\nPass away never actually use it and the insurance companies just walks away with all your money and that usually is a pretty bad taste in someone's Baptist I Will well jeeze if I'm going to give them a couple of hundred thousand dollars in premiums on that I'm not going to get anything out of it so\nInsurance companies realizes that maybe it was a problem for them and they built new products where now you can couple life insurance with long term care insurance and they called us the hybrid part of the industry ...\n... you can do it with a life insurance you can do it with a new ... right so the only ... riders can be added and they they package it in what's called a hybrid so the world has changed drastically and I would say for many\nWho are at that stage of life you know fifty enough so maybe you and your forties can start now you have to take a moment to just close your eyes and imagine for yourself\nWhat you're late life years would look like with what your wishes are with what you want them years to look like\nAnd from there look at what cost would be that's what we do so we often ask people what are we and it's hard to do because it's so emotional so we have a tool for example called wealth care\nAnd what our wealth care tool does it's actually spelled\nHealth with a W in front of it which is well it's kinda we did a whole program on it and you can go back and look at one of our past segments with the doctor the M. D.\nWho created this and basically the way the tool works and we use this to hear her desk all financial network it's to allow someone to\nImagine the type of life they want in those later years and then put the pieces in place to define what it is the type of facility you want to live in the type of care you want who within your family\nHas the direct is to be able to handle your money situations your personal situations it's it's basically setting things up\nFor yourself for those later years when we say later years this this really comes in when people hit hit you know those those early seventies into their eighties we call that late life planting a lot of people say oh I have my wheels my trust no that's end of life planning\nPets for those last days these are those years statistically that eighty percent of you listening will cognitively and physically slow down to the point where you need someone to help take care of you and statistically\nYou and me will be without a spouse\nStatistically so who's there\nWhat we find Ryan often is that when we ask people what the priorities are with their wealth and their life as they go on through life they don't want to be a burden to their loved ones and many of them say that almost always on the top three and if you're going to be number one that's right and if you want to be a burden to your loved\nOnes then don't do any of this planning because when they're hit with the reality that somebody has to take care of mom or dad or whoever the loved one is whether it's a grandparent whoever in those later years\nThere's so much emotion there are so many other family members that seemed to have a say with what mom or dad wanted a mom and dad are still here but they might not be able to fully articulate with their wishes were that's why in your forties fifties and sixties to do this is so important because then once we know\nHow you want to live those years\nWe can then match up the best type of strategy so that you can afford that that's exactly right see that's exactly what we do and some of the tools today Ryan you just mentioned so long term care is changed drastically there's traditional where it's just pure play\nAnd there's ways to go about planning which we just mentioned the plan will then lead you to the type of vehicles and strategies to put in place so that\nYou have that type of life you want when you might not be able to verbalize it\nOr write it out\nBut when you're sitting there your mind is still working well feeling okay inside that this is how I wanted\nIt to be so Ryan thanks

go something else I Want to cover in today's segment I'm going to do something a little bit more on this topic [noise]\nNext week or because I think it's very very important topic if it touches on IRAs we've done many a pod cast and many\nOn individual retirement accounts and retirement vehicles but I Want to kind of just what your palate right now with something in the tax code that can help many of you who use a financial advisor and currently have money in traditional retirement accounts\nThe new federal tax law ends the direction\nThat some of you get on advisory feet so if you have a financial advisor in the pain of financial advisor or see a fee based advisor which everybody has been told is the better way to go\nBecause there's more transparency there's more openness um there's no commissions it's a it's a pure away and and then more honest way\nTo handle relationship between a financial advisor and an individual like you who is planning so in the past prior to the new tax law that President Trump lobbied for and was able to achieve\nIn the new tax law it ends the ducks and that you would be able to receive by working with a financial advisor some of this is democratic movement because the ...\nAnd this feels if have you know financial adviser you must be rich and until Cory Booker gives everybody who is poor fifty thousand dollars not everybody's going to need a financial advisor so therefore that tax benefit you got for taking care of your future and planning\nThat deduction was taken away but there's a twist the IRS has a long held\nQualified retirement account policy that you can pay your financial advisor their feet out of your IRA count so\nYou don't want to do this with a Ross because you're not going to get any benefit but for many of you who have a traditional i._r._a. account and you're working with a financial advisor you can pull your financial advisor the out of your IRA count when you pull money out of an Iranian count\nTraditional i._r._a. you're taxed\nThe government wants to tax you on that money to after they hadn't been taxing along the way if you're under age fifty nine and a half not only the of the tax you have to pay ten percent penalty as well\nYou could pay as much for many of you anywhere from twenty five to thirty five percent\nAnd even forty to forty five percent between taxes in penalties so if you take ten thousand dollars out you might be paying forty five hundred dollars between pack some penalties a lot of money but here's what the government allows you to do the IRS if it's paying for your financial\nAdvisory costs they will not tax it or penalize it that's a nice benefit here's the twist you could only pay\nOn that IRA account so if you have an account that's not an IRA or you have a Ross\nAnd your advisors charging you for your whole relationship you're not going to be able to pay the whole relationship cost\nOut of that one IRA will tell you more about how you might want to structure things so that you can get that full benefit but for now I wanted to make you aware of that\nBecause I Know many had been alarmed that they've lost that adoption and it's a big deduction loss for many\nWhat's even more interesting is that it really hurts the sea only\nApproach to paying your financial advisor and in some cases for those of you who work with a financial advisor who might be a commission based person and not a fiduciary it looks like on paper you do better there we're going to talk about it further\nIn an upcoming segment titled how to get the\nBenefit of tax savings to pay your financial advisor out of your IRA count but for now I wanted to give you something to think about remember\nIf you are writing a check to pay your financial ... with that financial advisor you might want to re consider how you're paying that financial advisor and my advice would be paid the amount that you're allowed to pay out of your IRA\nYou'll get a nice tax benefit for that

and\nOften it doesn't have what it needs to do a really good job so\nWhat exactly does get the kidney in trouble well first of all not drinking water\nHardly anyone in America gets half ounce per pound body weight of water per day and that's kind of the minimum so let's say you were a hundred and fifty pounds\nYou'd need Seventy five ounces of water a day it's a little bit less than three chords\nAnd unfortunately a by not getting their water it's very very hard on the kidney the other problems for the kidneys are really it shares this with the brain is getting way too much\nRefined oil which is almost always omega six [noise] and then there by having a inadequate amount of omega three fatty acids and in particular the end chain form of\nOmega three that so needed by the brain and by the um the kidneys that's called the ha do cause a ...\nAnd of course that also plays a role in promoting healthy inflammatory response now kid needs can also be in trouble because you've had a

retention in the legs uh Damon and it looks like it's a mystery well it's really not a ministry the issue is\nIs very old or scarred trauma the feed the automated now there are many other types of\nDramas that can occur that may affect the low back and in effect kidney as well so what do we do to really give ourselves great help for the kidney because it's so important\nTo our energy and our power through the day so number one you can jump on one of our are really great devices and this is really important for the skin to visit device called the high drama that are very inexpensive\nAnd its hand held and it says censor that can tell us how we're doing moisture wise within the various layers of the skin\nSo you can make sure you're drinking enough water every day for your body needs and that this becomes a much more of a problem in very hot climates than it would be in colder climates\nYou kind of course supplement the ha and looking at American food\nUh and having done this for many many years and having tested thousands of people I Would say that everyone should supplement the shape of the do ...\nAnd that gives you two options won a vegetarian option we call it ... two hundred\nWhich is a two hundred milligrams of omega three fatty as it\nUh from micro allergies so it's the clean is\nLeast likely to deliver in the kind of a toxin here you could take maybe three or if you've been to fish in a long time maybe you'll take five for a few months and then cut back to three and our latest edition\nI'm a PHD ha which is from a fish will without any molecular distillation or any weird things remaining we've been able to clean this oil\nAnd so if you are not a vegan you might consider this is a good option a teaspoon of the day\nIs what we would recommend and this guy is not only critical for great kidney health and just about everyone we do energetic testing on shows a shortfall for ... and so we know this is something everyone should be using\nAnd of course it's critical to the nervous system and the brain as well so can we do more for kidney absolutely we've got a kidney support formula\nAnd this is of course live the stores and it'll target
