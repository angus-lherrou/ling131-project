R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offered today from purity products no strings attached\nThis is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nAt it's amazing that most people don't know this word highly ironic asset and of course it's made it's all over our body it's\nIn our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body but more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby ha it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board ... gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smoothing skin and thicker hair and so on\nAll of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible\nJoints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they they certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make\nMore ha now women have more ha to lose the men do\nAnd you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course ... products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joint\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers confused what to do to support their joints to people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones we lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that when you find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joint and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers are going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning\nBack there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid they actually inject this into joints orthopedist do\nIn the year two thousand and this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself\nBut the ha revolution has come here pat and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom who writes to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age\nParticipating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii this past year Seventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joints did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no\nHere's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boil and I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball with a twenty year old and I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one out of that is pretty popular MSN how does this agency stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any reason to\nGlue costs main takes quite a while to kick in\nMSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joint and if we can just replaced it that's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young here's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support his lower back\nAnd of course he said I Can't believe it now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product\nPeople have tried all the alternatives they've searched everywhere else pat and they haven't heard of ...\nNow the reorder raids on aging sort of tell me that things are phenomenal the product works and study shows how but one of the customers saying what are they telling you candidly what are they saying the bill's already\nIt's amazing to me how people say just keep sending this it's wonderful it changed my life here is

count after you've passed they\nCan take advantage of certain rules like stretching the IRA and delaying tax even further here's the number one mistake that both individuals like you can make with your IRA but we're finding financial advisors make this mistake too\nAnd it's checking that beneficiary form\nIt's very very very important\nTo check the beneficiary form meaning who you're leaving that IRA to missing or incorrect beneficial reforms are an epidemic and costly and both last tax benefits and family harmony that's a mistake that generally cannot be sick since it's most often discovered\nAfter the IRA owner has passed away at that point beneficiaries of forced to involve tax legal financial advisors to figure out how to distribute funds when there's no clear instructions\nAnd more legal obstacles my advice to you is to make sure that you check your beneficiary designations as well as contingency beneficiaries so for example if\nA husband and wife have an IRA and they both pass at the same time those IRAs that each one has individually has a contingent beneficiary because most\nHusbands lists their wife or at least that's the advice we give and vice versa wife will lift the husband 'cause you don't have a joint IRA these are individual retirement accounts that is why it's called an irate individual\nTherefore there's only one owner of that IRA\nThat owners and list who the money flows to if something happens to them\nThat's usually the spouse well what happens if something happens to both of you they allow for what's called contingent beneficiary and guess what people don't review these there were IRA since the eighties and nineties out there where the paperwork was filled out end\nEither a beneficiary might not have been listed or a beneficiary may have been listed but we find situations now and there's landmark Supreme Court cases there's one Kennedy versus plant administrator for Japan savings and investment plant\nThe justices ruled unanimously that the retirement account should have been paid to an ex wife because she was never removed as the beneficiary after divorce\nEven though she waived her right to the account as part of the divorce settlement well guess what the daughter was supposed to be the beneficiary the daughter lost four hundred and two thousand\nHer father intended it for her to inherit it was an eight year court battle that the daughter had against their retirement account\nSimply because uh beneficiary form was not changed you can change the beneficiaries here's something else it's very important to consider your will does not replace the IRA beneficiary form\nWhat that means is when you have an IRA and you list beneficiaries let's say you have three children and you list those three children but yet in your will you have other verbiage in there the will\nDoes not supersede the IRA beneficiary form let's assume one child has passed away but still on your beneficiary for if you've listed a contingent beneficiary the contingent beneficiary is there is there's no beneficiaries\nNow in certain cases you might have multiple beneficiaries are still alive\nThat needs to be worked out but that work out can be complicated that's why it's important at major life events\nThat you update your irate beneficiaries\nSo as you can see lots of rules to IRAs mistakes can be made the number one mistake\nIs the IRA beneficiary designation it needs to be reviewed it should be reviewed annually\nMany advisors use rule of thumb whenever there's a major life event change a wedding a loss of life a\nTransition in life uh divorce things of major life events they should be reviewed I tend to find major life events or emotional so it's tough to review I'm there I go to a simple super role when you change your batteries in your smoke detectors you might want to take a look at your beneficiaries I Would tell you need to look at the beneficiaries\nOn your IRAs some what they want to just do it during taxis and you know why 'cause that's another time that people are running around and they don't seem to have any time and therefore it gets neglected or if you have a financial advisor the financial advisor should be reviewing it with you and often will trigger\nAn annual review to take a look to see if anything's changed in your life to make sure that the beneficiaries on your IRAs are up to date current and within your wishes\nBut guess what we're finding that many financial advisers are making this mistake too and not double and triple checking on an annual basis those beneficiaries so\nThere's a quick tutorial on individual retirement accounts what they are\nHow they work why they're so beneficial\nHow they contractually or an obligation between you and Uncle Sam and more importantly the number one mistake that I Am seeing that can really really really create some damage\nIf you don't stay up on it and pay attention to it and that's the beneficiary designation as well as your contingent beneficiaries\nI'm Steve ... you're listening to the your life your will show I appreciate you participating if you have questions on IRAs how they work\nComplications you want to review\nFeel free reach out eh Steve and see if unplanned dot com I highly recommend that you do a beneficiary review to Europe IRAs and work related retirement plans because they all allow you to have a beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary so\nThe beneficiary view for IRAs is very important if you haven't had one done lately [noise]\nSemi now I'll tell you how

in which if you're taking care of a loved one or think you will be in the future\nWhere you can actually get paid\nTo be the caregiver for an aging loved one it's called Medicaid's cash and counseling program to pay family caregivers if you elect to have a family member\nIntervene and provide care themselves you can go into a special program called cash and counseling\nThat the Medicaid program that provides monthly budget for people on Medicaid whereby they can reimbursed family caregivers for providing\nActivities of daily living these are assisted services now I'll be with rules it's very complicated each state has its separate set of rules and different definitions for\nCash and counseling what you need to know was cashing counseling and the reason why this program doesn't seem to be getting much traction or not embraced as much as it should is one I don't think the financial advisor community out there is educating enough on it number one number two\nWhen we are doing our legal work\nEstate planning the lawyers aren't addressing it now if you go to an elder care where they could be addressed but not many do that\nLook the essence of the cash and counseling programs for an individual who otherwise qualify for Medicaid and you go through and get a waiver\nThat's the key word here a waiver so once you've been approved and got to remember it's the senior that gets approved and many seniors have difficulty navigating system they'll need somebody to be with them because they're the ones that get approved\nWhen they get approved\nAnd designate who their caregiver will be and that caregiver give us gets signed off on as qualifying to do this\n\nThey are now in the program called cash and counseling they now have to apply for a waiver what does that waiver do that waiver is like cash it allows cash\nPayments to be made\nTo the caregiver in this case this individual daughter who will be the caregiver hence\nShe's taking time off work to help her dad but she's also getting a wage to do it\nSo as you can see there's multiple multiple options communication is the key guidance is very important as well as education\nUsually open dialogue amongst the family members as what's important here because of most aging baby boomers are those are the greatest generation will tell me\nThey wanna leave something for their children and\nMajority of the time I'm using Ninety percent rule of thumb for me when I get to know those children and talk to them you know those children say\nThat would be nice but we want mom or dad to be comfortable\nQueen rather them use it for themselves were good so there's tools there's things that you can do once dialogue begins and when that dialogue happens you have a better idea\nWhen everybody is of sound mind and not emotional not upset because the unexpected things in life that happen has happened and either mom or dad\nIs in a different a different place\nMentally and physically so when did the share that with you many of you who had been emailing me ask Steve at sea offend plan dot com and asking the question what I Do mom or dad broke they need care\nWhat's that mean to our retirement because now we're going to take care of them and where we thought we'd be able to put money more money into our retirement plans\nLike we're not going to be able to so can you run some numbers for me and I'm surprised

deal and um most people are not aware of some of the armamentarium that's available these days\nUh one of the big players on the block that has not been available before is something called nuclear tides and these are the actual building blocks of the cell and it takes a staggering six billion be\nTo build one cell so once we had a blow an injury uh dramas surgery or even a cold or flu or anything that would damage the tissue we're calling upon our supply of nuclear times well\nOr if you've got them great if you don't you just have to wait for the body to make fun of and when this comes to\nA building new tissue it can really be a problem that say you had his surgery and nobody's going to pack whatever it's gotten on hand into that cut or wound or injury but if you've got those nuclear ties will uh this can mean helping the body deliver or promote the best possible\nRecovery and function for your body\nYou know nuclear jobs have been around quite a while in Europe is sold under the name on set because they view them is so important to promote best health if you're struggling with any kind of immune issue\nAnd of course in addition to nuclear tides ... is another key player that can act like a stand in immune system especially in your intestines because it is human active pre formed immuno glob villains\nAnd of course this is completely different than a nuclear times and what it is able to do and of course the needs of the time as for nuclear ... ah can easily be satisfied there but uh you can reduce the white cells demand\nDuring all of this by jumping on a little bit of ... really great thing to do\nBut you know one of the big missing links we don't usually have normal levels of vitamin D three\nAnd in the last five six years\nThese three has been shown to be a critical player in the formation of literally all two hundred plus immune compounds at the body mix wow so this is a really key player so we produce a product called the three gold and\nUh it's really good they use about probably about six drops of this and if you're under forty you can just take the drops straight preferably at your main meals so there's plenty of protein\nAnd that's the escort for the fat of the deed three\nAnd a if you're forty or over then you really should consider putting the D. three in a maybe a half ounces of water and adding a three four drops of an organic lemonade that's essential oil of orange stirred up good you'll see that the lemon ... pie\nAnd quickly the big droplets the D. three become tiny tiny so now regardless of how your gall bladders performing\nYour body's going to absorb this beats read just beautifully\nSo these are to me the ABCs that everybody ought to have around\nSo that when you need them you got him but deeds tree is one you want to use day in and day out so you don't challenge your immune system or with deficiencies shelf by all means jump on today's great specials nuclear tides\n... and our vitamin D
