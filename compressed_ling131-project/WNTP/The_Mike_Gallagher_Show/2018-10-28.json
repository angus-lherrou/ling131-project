still be shocked and it's really jolt it\nJust seems to be a\nAn isolated incident I Hope that from a crazy that always has been over the crazy or what your sources on what the French ...\n[noise]\nWell I I Hope we know enough about the type of person you know there's a website that this individual was on quite frankly I hadn't heard of that and I'm not certain\nLaw enforcement or got aware of it but there's a lot of communication apparently going on among these are the people who are\nSomewhat on balance we talked about the\nThat you know ... anti Semitic neo Nazi type type issues but we have to stay on on top of this sense yes I'm over here in New York because they\nAll this ending was that anti Semitism aligned thing here and that those are the center they died the among the Jewish community\nOver several countries none of that we talked about it and several countries seem to happen in the United states what I'm over here looking at the issue was willing but it was really quite a shock and awe\nAnti Semitism has gone down in the in the U.S generally speaking the numbers are saw so you could point he didn't eat it over here is very difficult to\nCount on the numbers because people do report are the types of into ...\nInto here pushing shoveled speeding or you know by a language we did see a woman killed earlier this year loading old plants but again I when I when I saw what\nHappened in uh Pittsburgh yesterday it it does it make what happened over here pale in comparison\nNow if you were in charge a commissioner or what would you do what you would you have more\nArmed guards the synagogues or would you recommend that synagogues have better security uh what what are your thoughts\nWell I think every synagogue and in fact probably every institution religious or otherwise needs a security plan and frankly in Europe and other things so the dogs they have pretty comprehensive plan that secret is the\nExercise those plans to practice goes though planned I don't know I'm going to say that on guard will be the first person killed if somebody comes in with a rifle yes for police officers\nAre loaded ESPN so there's no ... there's no easy answer but a comprehensive security plan that known by every one that is exercise\nIs certainly a starting point you have to know what to do any of that the ... city you have to control your and instead they are as best as possible technology can help in that regard it's expensive and you know people\nTalked about on guard the bulldogs but it ... ... ... do have the resources are ... to do that\nSo I I think government I think certainly in New York City and the a long history of protecting a Jewish institution and religious institutions in general I Know you'll see a you know more police officers are multiples units I should say in front of synagogues or certainly\nFor those are the same boat as future every city can't do that New York and do it in definitely the individual locations has to be able to\nProtect themselves and that's what that happily hence the security part and come and said let me tell you that that in every police precinct in New York City there is the capability of giving in in that\nA comprehensive security assessment and that's what should it should be happening um how does that work shirt synagogue ... can be knocking on the door of the local precinct and the current events in Austin says come and and knew that assessment\nTell them what they need its fleet service that's been around so long thought\nA measure of the other thing that happened this week is we had that uh\nBomber that sense and build bombs to a lot of the political\nLeaders\nIn the United states and he's got captured I mean uh the FBI\nAnd the other north western sanctions she did a great job and I think within twenty four hours a day they got him\nA what do you what are you on that\n\nList individual uh the ring but he's orange damaged or as as well made mistakes when you make a lot of bomb the last year or a total ... what's your\nAll of them go and then probably you're\nGoing to make mistakes and that's what he did in law enforcement now has to lend is technical a\nCapability that were brought to bear in this case\nA single friends that are ... you know the ... something was greatly aided\nBy a computer as Asia by technology or in DNA or the ability to locate cell phones you know where someone is with the baking themselves up on this person just\nApparently didn't realize the the the power the capacity of the federal government of law enforcement in general\nTo crack down on the type of a ... ... people and types of incidents so ah yeah I think it was impressive job on the part of ... also done very\nUh very quickly but thank God they have the\nAbility to do it at all so I thank God that nobody was interested in in many ways the the system work they were all intercepted in some way shape or form whether or not it could have gone off I'm not I'm not certain\nAbout that but anyway we were able uh to insist that done and to a dinner party with individual on the very short period of time that I think that's a great well\nI'm sure the other thing that's been going on while you've been away\nA ... in Europe or as spin that caravan of ten thousand anyway from Seventy thousand to fourteen thousand subjects she's ten thousand\nMarching towards the United states border with the intent of a marketing asylum\nPresident Trump percent you sent troops down there to stop what do you what's going on I mean a lot of my friends said those guys are are paid to organize and have those people heading towards that border any opinion\nBut we you know we ... we can't let them come in and you know in that manner\nI used to be the U.S customs commissioner or about Twenty years ago\nSo I'm pretty familiar with the with the border I think customs and border protection they'd be really a great job I don't think that caravan will get to our border\nOr in the sky that it is now I think\nMexico will participate in in ... and some of it I don't know if you need the military to do it I think ... a little closer than in a well resourced to prevent any sort of a new push on the border coming cause\nNow the whole the whole it into a shoot 'em you know as far as what their status is that and then something else uh that's going to be looked at by customs and border protection a personnel but I I think it'll be it'll be will anvil I wouldn't be\nConcerned about any sort of a major disruption ...\nFormer commissioner Ray Kelly

want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYeah this is an exciting topic talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features an exciting molecule old Korea Team now pat a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly used in the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders\nCollege high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat\nGreat for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nCan you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nSure pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single celled tissue Oregon in your system and its job in the body is to generate\nAnd maintain strength and power it's an every single show on the body Ninety five percent of but however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf kind of anything like that it keeps your muscles powered up in their higher energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties\nSeventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had ... stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older\nLike everything else we don't do that is well we are blessed Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that wouldn't you supplement with Korea Team\nHe goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps South Korea team in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support the memory and brain health\nAnd it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show when you were talking about how it lipic athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance strengthen performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports\nNutrition supplement there's no question\nAbout that pat you've used it body builders know about it athletes\nKnow about it Korea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach was of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid\nIt might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge but back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here\nKorea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing that for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies\nThis stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation we call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in space stronger\nWith hundreds of human studies and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat in like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat\nJust five days of eight grams of crazy and supported mental test subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking them math questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't Korea Team didn't fatigue as quickly\nMentally so this is amazing stuff it re chargers all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea teen to stay fit strong and healthy pi you say\n... going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week she does the\nFree weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that and then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is that her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show how much more mainstream this is it's cold every strong\nAnd it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it but even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand thirty and\nThe researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nEven exercised so I'm quoting here\nCreating supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string power and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this\nCreating supplementation without training in the elderly\nCould potentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven tourists and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective pat\nWhen you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies backup where we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this every strong formula\nNow listeners can only get every strong this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right Oh absolutely\nI Know it combines the Korea teen with the vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit XP bore on there's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure creed and that's a curious to find as pre teen from Europe and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D\nAnd it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not going to spend that today and that was purely products because today it for your job is to be one of the first thousand calls you could you be twelve and ... and your ... strong you're just pay six Ninety five is shipping we want to get it right out you we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it\nTry it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nI was talking about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take you to give people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottle today\nYeah you can choose tablets her powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these days are making a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing is becoming very big these days so if you're doing something like that the ... very powders fantastic could just take a scoop dump it right into your juice pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it but\nIf you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers and already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this for teen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers call this a seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula the product we are talking about right now to\nDouble blind placebo control study thirty golfers took our every strong powder for one month no exercise nothing different in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could live the way faster had\nPeople shouldn't just how how about this this is amazing because this was a golf study but more explosive and there's more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board\nI we just got a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team would you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nWhat at my one concern with this show\nIs it literally it sounds too good to be true right I when I\nTell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're gonna think I'm making this up you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen I almost couldn't believe it I said to myself if it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how everybody's not using it but\nI started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's as simple as this you're going to get on the restaurant you're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror and see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up and of course we didn't just there to create a pure Korea teen\nThe fruit XP remember that joined health\nWeight of the coffee Barry extract that nominal antioxidant more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful in the opposite of protection\nI added the vitamin D because it's so important across the board free for bone health but also for seniors vitamin D so important for muscles especially as we get older for strength and coordination so this is a very comprehensive formula\nAgain this would easily cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks to replicate on your own but today it's free\nAnd not only that let's

hasn't doesn't have to do with\nUm the amount of the nutrition fickle as much as it has to do with the appropriate nutritious fickle giving interim procreate amount for that patient and that conditions\nAre two questions jurors do the ... pursuit Nichols work and your experience twenty two years yeah and and number two which with prescription beds a lot of side effects shall we talk about on other shows or their side effects for the new show\nThere can be as you know you know just because something he says it's natural doesn't mean it's always good for a particular patient I think you and I've spoken about night a nice and you have a time and the flush and people doing it and then the blood pressure is way out of it goes way down and now we have a problem\nUh that particularly in mail enhancement products I have seen nightmares and this all the products that are out there under men's health yes guys please be careful please\nBecause it's an amazing thing because you go right there in the end the clerk and many times the clerks or very knowledgeable and many times they're not\nBut it is their responsibility to actually ask you what other conditions do you have that may be contributing to some of your challenges that you're responsible airline has as as a consumer but in our clinic we make sure that we know your history very well before we deliver the IDs\nAnd with with this you said that could be some side effects for sure you to go by her talk about the ... the amount and the level as opposed to pharmaceuticals\nMuch different much different and the idea is in many cases to tell you the truth in most cases than not\nPeople by maybe multiple for a new tricycle federal doing the same brain I mean really they're probably not getting what they think they're getting right since they have to work synergistic leaves well John you don't give every body you know five different types of vitamin C. and so you know\nWhat you do is you take a specific type of vitamin C. or specific ... whether it's from beat or tapioca or something else\nAnd it's that is those little nuances that make going to a place like ours a medical hydration clinic very very important\nEither has drawn to match the with Dr Molly fantasia PHD doctor\nAnd the executive director and founder of innovative medical associates located in Marlton New Jersey and also in Galloway New Jersey and if you have a question for Dr Molly we're talking about what they do their how it differs from what you've come to expect from primary care or as I said earlier any type of theory general and we're talking about the use of\nAs innovative medical associates does the use of new to suit of goals as opposed to pharmaceuticals and we're talking about how that works you do have you mentioned Dr Marc test that he's the medical director right Dr ... is also\nCatholic there yet but I can pass pack Catholic as a medical director of certain programs and also the associate medical director for the entire facility\nThere's a variety of things that you do there and we'll get into it after our first breaking I Know you want to talk about some patients but in general if you come to innovate of medical associates and you have a challenge what can you expect in terms of how long it's going to take and just how will you be\nThere right chant that these are really interesting question because again it's going to depend on the length of time that you had the challenge it's going to depend on your physiology what's going on medically your co morbidities exactly what you would do when utilizing pharmaceuticals or other intervention\nYou know it's the best guesstimate as to what can you know help you a slow progression of certain conditions and that's really what we do we want to slow the progression of certain conditions in order to improve quality of life so saying that\nUsually we see changes for people within five weeks it's hard to believe that is true so Ken treatments five weeks if they come in twice a week but again it's going to depend on the patient and what the political calls for\n[noise] interesting after the break we're going to talk about a patient and if it happens a lot\nI mean I've been working with you for Twenty years and I've also been a ... to ...\nAnd I have heard the stories I've seen I've seen I I Know you have witnessed this I Know and you know I tell people undergo a scratch your head and say well what are you talking about it it's hard you know it's so so can you help us understand how and why this works\nWell it works because their constituents in the natural a product that\nActually have properties that help certain types of conditions for example when we use antibiotics is what we're trying to do is reduced free radicals which are going to later but I mean they have constituents who are they have medicinal properties\nI Love telling my argument store yeah that's a great story because\nYour doctors prescribe ... blood

facility\nAnd he was actually looking a to actually improve a improve their delivery system their actual Blue Ridge just because we have a wonderful as you know wonderful a facility right so he just
