trying to\nMake America better\nBut he's more under right side and the left side and I met him when we had a dinner party a for Jim Joyce\nOn his thoughts of maybe becoming speak to MORNING EDITION of bread and how are you\nI'm doing great and that's one thing I always like starting points off with it's not our politics that makes America great it's the people and when I was just on the last week we heard that unemployment is now three point seven percent the lowest level since December Nineteen sixty nine\nI'm very optimistic about the future of this country\nWell you know it seems like a Washington everybody and see each other's\nThroats the Democrats or Republicans throats for Republicans or Democrats denotes a stories are being told about uh people in high school uh you know grabbing each other and nobody don't confirmations\nBut they're trying to change our constitution you're guilty guilty\nUntil you prove yourself innocent [noise] tell me your thoughts about what's going on in Washington\n... one of the greatest things about the United states and and actually I'd say in the most western civilization countries is this whole idea of the rule of law\nOr not or we're we're not about mob rule we our republic not a democracy when you go back to the ancient like Plato they always said before you had charity you had this pure democracy it to them pure democracy was just mob rule went fifty one percent of people say it's so\nIt is so our founders designed a system that would work that way our founders want her to make sure we uh checks and balances proper procedures rule of law so that people were protected from the passions of the Bob and right now what you're seeing is a lot of people who are still very upset\nAbout the election and Donald Trump's election and their ... their emotions get the better of them and to accuse\nIs to be a is to declare someone guilty right now\nBut I think you're starting to see just to be from polls and for more sponsor but now they're starting to overreact or there's there's a reaction to this overreaction and I'm hoping this is the beginning of sanity starting to come back\nDo you think sanity a dream come back in ... and people like like I said too I I did you\nUh uh some older a politician's before and the old\nDays you didn't like each other in three with each other but just sat down and did what's best for America and we're not doing that now\nWhy is that as a result nice study history or a fifty fifty country right now every election is going to be the biggest election in history because every election in the\nHouse could swing the Senate could swing every four years the presidency could swing so were behaving more like a parliamentary government where you have to have unity of the party\nOr to be able to pass anything but eventually there's going to be a breakthrough we're going to go from a fifty fifty country to a forty five fifty five or six forty country and so we're kind of set up for the next generation right now and that's why politics is so visceral because\nWe're sitting right now early voting begins and just two weeks yeah the elections thirty days away but the the ... early voting is in two weeks so we are right on the way to the costs but this election\nAnd I guess you could say Republicans are trending to keep the senator grow it but they could lose it\nRepublicans are trending to lose the house but they could keep it and because of that politics just take some more passionate visceral tell\nNow some of the things that happened or what this lady coming up that uh that said that she was hurt grow to like ... or whatever by a have a new law\nHuh but she doesn't remember where was she doesn't remember what year it was she doesn't remember who else was there nobody remembers nobody else remembers the incident she says you pass the polygraph\nBut our boyfriend now says that she ... she was teaching other people how to pass a polygraph right I mean ... and five or six of Democratic senators\nBony ... is I mean\nWhat does it do long term what does it do for the mid term elections do of commonsense Americans hurt\nOne party or the other more on November\n... well what I mean we're we're talking today about a month away from the election you right now it's trending that what happened with the Kavanaugh hearings has dramatically helped the Republicans because it was a unifying the vet and it was a unifying event because\nThey saw when you see what the how the hearings went in the Senate\nThese ... hearings when you saw people getting arrested\nIn the Senate buildings\nEconomy was a preview of what Congress would look like if\nDemocrats get control in fact the Democrats are from the house sent a letter to the president a couple of days ago and the letter said if we take back the house we're going to investigate a cabin off for perjury\nThe war I think people have come to realize overtime uh because it's been chronicled by some of the architects of the war like former secretary of Defense Robert McNamara it was a mistake and I think\nIt was a war that was viewed in the context of the Cold War a it was kind of a proxy war with China and Russia at a stage ... um [noise] the guys who served their served with incredible distinction\nThey gave their all they did the best under very tough circumstances but the dynamics of the war itself just the the the\nThe goal was elusive and very complicated and I think ultimately I'm ... and people came to see that it was a civil or in a line in the sand against communist\nWell you know you started in a in a war and it was too late sixties that those were very very adventures years and and you've had some great career talk about politics today what's going on in Washington\nFor why should has broken that I think most Americans understand that it's a it's a mess uh the the Congress as a dysfunctional because it's torn apart ideologically\nA politically a it's a bad place and it's a sad thing because we need to be moving faster making decisions faster we need to be rebuilding our country frankly\nI'm you know I fired at LaGuardia frequently those are great rebuild effort there thanks to the Port Authority a and in some other places in our country people tried to do things but it's not as bad there's no federal project well there's no federal commitment to that\nAnd other countries are moving much faster than we are a China's got\nA ... you know high speed rail system where trains go three hundred miles an hour and they're comfortable and they run on time\nAnd we're just not matching those guys are building effort so I'd like to see us do that we ought to be building America out a and there's a lot we can do a strike that ourselves and doing that\nBut but why shouldn't you can't make those decisions you you you you just don't seem to have the leadership in place that is ready to make it work the way it used to work\nAnd I agree with you a hundred and ten percent you you and Ted Kennedy uh we're very close\nAnd even though you disagreed with a lot of Republicans you sat around and discuss things so civilized people and what's going on right now there's no discussion is over there everybody you see is that each other's throats and uh and when you when you change in Washington\nDC uh going on in the mid term elections\nWell I think there's going to be a reaction in the mid term so I mean I sense that people are pretty uh\nPretty motivated a I think they're very angry at a uh what's been going on a ... I don't know which party benefits where and that completely I Hope to America benefits and they buy my hope is that\nWe're a guard was what party you you're coming from you're going to come to Washington and determined to work together\nTo make things happen in the best interest of the country and uh obviously we need to fix the immigration policy we we need to fix health care policy\nUh we need to be doing what I said a moment ago about building out infrastructure we have problems with the education system um I think people know that uh\nUh that we obviously have security challenges from abroad and I think we have to have allies\nAnd the efforts to try to deal with some of those things so I'm not sure this going it alone a idea works to the best advantage in the long term but the interests of our security\nBut I Do understand why people are fed up with the status quo and I think that it's very understandable the anger that's been reflected in some of the elections we've had recently\nI hear they're too aren't going around helping certain uh uh senators and congressmen or protect campaigns and\nFrom in terms use you know what's going on with ... in Washington made people angry on both sides and I've never seen this before so you know ... what do you nine angry on both sides and take time we\nGo to John Edwards say I I think it was actually I'm Sorry I couldn't hear the last part\nOf the country to come together\nWhere we have to for God's sakes anymore you know if the United states of America we we we need to be a there are certain priorities where it would seem to me we ought to be able to find a compromise necessary to get things done I mean even on immigration we ought to be able to find a way to\nHave stronger border security guarantee that borders being something that visas means something our sovereignty is protected but at the same time\nBe fair and thoughtful about how you're going to deal with people who've been in this country for twenty five or Thirty years and and and we also need to recognize that\nImmigrants have been important to certain entry level jobs in America a this is our country's been built and\nI think we can find middle ground I think that's fair but here's what happened last time job you know John McCain and Lindsey Graham\nWe're working with Chuck Schumer and other Democrats trying to find a middle ground but the extreme extreme on both sides started to demand way you can do that you can't do this and India nothing happened\nThat's why Paul Ryan is out\nYes that's that's exactly right people have been driven out by that extreme demand and John Banner likewise and so forth so I think that\nYou know we've got to recognize that is not what the founding fathers intended\nOr you know the famous play on Broadway and now a Hamilton has a wonderful song about the you know the room where it happens and and uh you know there was this great compromise that took place when Madison and Hamilton and German Guy\nThe room and made it out but um\nThat's what you got to do and that's how historically our country is done best as what people act in the interests of the country now at the interests of one party or the other\nNow you've always dedicated your life to our country and ah\nI Know after the mid term ... if he did make a statement that\nYou may consider coming back and helping our country is in other ways maybe even run for president ah he meets commonsense Democrats come together to bring the country together which are considering\nWhat I said John in answer to a question like yours was I'm not ruling anything out but I'm not sitting around a you know actively laying the groundwork are making any plans I I really don't\nI I think the focus of everybody right now should be on the election is going to take place and thirty three days thirty four days somewhere in there\nUm we have an opportunity in the mid term ... voice our dissatisfaction we have a lot of good candidates around\nI mean I I ... you know I'm going to be in New Jersey campaigning for ... worked in the state department is running for Congress I just was with Andy Kim the other day and the other candidate New Jersey use\nI'm a who\nHas been ah you know an expert and national security and I I think there are a lot of qualified people around the country are you a ... who's running in Staten Island I think for Congress who's a veteran a there are a lot of veterans run it\nThe veterans of Afghanistan veterans of Iraq and my sense is they're going to bring a\nPretty grounded patriotic sense of direction and responsibility to the task so I'm excited about the many of the candidates and by the way both parties Republican and Democrat there are veterans and women running group to bring a lot to the table I say\nI I think the key word is the word common sense on both sides and to bring the country together\nYeah I mean common sense since ... I mean it is what it is ... if you if you're only going to Washington to pursue an extreme ideological\nPoint of view and you're willing to say my way or the highway that's how the government of the United states crashes to a halt I mean remember we actually had the government of our country shuts down\nTo me that's just that's nothing represents the failure of people in Washington and to do their jobs more than the shutdown of the government of our country you know since then people have been a little bit chasing and less willing to play that\nPlay that card but ah there's still a not a

but what does magnesium forward\nTalking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart beat ... very important factor in life\nYeah I Would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions that are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety\nAsthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient\nDiabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's Bastille pearls is getting a list just goes on and on and on\nAnd then this this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with you know what happens is that you need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nThough so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body needs to actually fill the relaxation after you drink the uh after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain okay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and that case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei fibromyalgia\nWhich is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's they're linked there\nYeah there's a vicious circle\nThat I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their foods well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more harassed or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body to actually starting to manifest at\nWell all due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and is and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the

be able to get a prescription are doctors are able to write for whatever it is that you need\nBut more than likely we're going to try to a assessed what it is you need and use the least amount of the pharmaceutical and all men that\nWith nutrition sugar goals natural substances the kinds of things you can buy the health food store\n[noise] interesting I had dinner with some friends last night we got on the subject of fat and drugs no and I'm thinking about I'm thinking about you and I'm thinking about what we always talk about here on the show and so my friend says ... says I've been on the set and drugs for ten years he says I just got used to the pain [laughter] well\n[laughter] that is that something I Hope none of our patients ever say to rise right just get used to the pain and regardless of what's causing the bank we don't want that are all about what improving your quality of life\nIf you have pain from the drugs what good is it exactly right and it's interesting why is it that at our age John when we go out to dinner all we talk about is how many drugs were on\nIt's amazing isn't it yeah it is amazing that now Dr Molly and you we can't really entered that conversation so much can we know that we're not on that many\nDrugs no ... and that's what made me think and I didn't get into it because\nI mean there's been a friend for a long time course ... he's kind of a no at all okay so I'm thinking if I start this conversation that it's going to go into a direction and I you know what I'm having dinner I'm not I'm not going to get into it but when he says I just get used to the pain yeah that's I thought about you and what I had said to you with that and drugs\nAnd you told me well let's do this let's do that you and your doctor's consulted and eventually right you did something with a natural product\nTo exactly and we reduce the level of your stat drug right so that is the key the key is we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater if you need a medication we're going to give it to you but\nIf we can also affects you wait to change you need by reaching a therapeutic level of the natural substance and by the way the only way that we know to really reach that therapeutic level is through the hydration\nIf we can do that then we have made you a winner\nAbsolutely and you did that for me because I'll tell you what\n... and and working with you and being your patient for over Twenty years\nThe one thing you taught me is you know just tell me what's happening just keep me informed I Will keep doing whatever we need to do to get you to the point where you need to be exact and I knew that and your doctor mark prescribed a couple of different\nStat and drugs none of them which were because there was a lot of pain right and I'm not from learning from you I'm not going to get used to the pain because that doesn't have to be [laughter]\nOh definitely not so finally we got to this point right with the red use rice replacing the stat and drugs and now the cholesterol is fine\nRight and amuse utilizing the hydration to actually use a key later to help us with that and so it it's really everything we do we do with great thought John\nYes I Know that I Know that I mean I I like I said I've been a passion for Twenty years and I try to convey that here on the show\nBecause it's not just me blowing smoke at the audience that this is really this is real life he's a real situations\nBut I just want to remind everyone if you're just tuned in our show is health watch and you'll find a sitter every Sunday eleven 'til noon here a news talk nine Ninety Dr Molly fantasia is here she is the PHD Dr executive director and the founder of innovative medical associates\nAnd they are located in Marlton New Jersey as well as in Galloway New Jersey\nAnd if you have a question for Dr Mali right now er during the course of the show feel free to call in eight seven seven nine nine zero W. N. T. P. A. seven seven nine nine zero nine six eight seven so\nIn your\nClinic innovative medical associates the natural products the hydration or you may suggest supplement South Korea's patience and of course those kind of so people can understand that they kind of take the place of prescription minutes and then\nThey may take the place they may do that or they may all met a prescription med so that we're able to reduce the dose of it so that the side effects then are reduced as well so it many times physicians look at\nMedication and there's two schools of thought sometimes some physicians start at the top of the medical writer right I'll give you a bank job right it's quick they want a bang the problem now\nAnd that that some some are a little less there are a little less aggressive and more concerned a lot depends on so called medical judgment I don't make those calls are doctors do\nBut I can tell you that our philosophy is to use the least amount of the pharmaceutical necessary to help correct the problem all many with a therapeutic\nLevel of the nutritional supplements\nAnd that's the philosophy so area if you need a prescription you on again doctors will prescribe it right but usually at least should have done that for me usually\nIt's the lowest dose right and like you said other doctors start on the top your doctor to believe in low if I can do increase you increase right\nOr we slowly cut you down from these mega doses to a dose that's appropriate along with using the natural substances\nAnd again everybody knows there's a certain amount of lifestyle change in many cases that needs to be done Staten drugs are a good example I mean obviously if somebody's out eating all kinds of fatty meat cetera you know well we'd better take that into consideration and figure out\nHow we're appropriately gonna does this this person and that's a job my physician do very well\nBack to my friend [laughter] he told me he had steak four times this week and he's got he's got a high blood pressure problem a cholesterol problem and he's got a heart problem\nPlanning on going to talk a little bit about cardiac to that you know we'll talk about the size of wait a minute there's something wrong here you know four times a week and not just a little state now talking about steak houses were you know the measuring stick one's sure\nSure and that's always a problem in again we want people to enjoy their life but we don't want life to kill me\n[laughter] ... so I I guess what one of the questions that I always have and I know people have especially when they have the initial consultation with you\nIs that ... and I can tell them that this works for me but does it doesn't work and how does that work in some cases better than prescription drugs [laughter]\nWell the idea is most natural substances or as I like to call them God's ingredients has been around since the beginning of time and the idea is you need to reach a therapeutic level with these natural substances and that's the key most times the natural substances fail\nI'm not saying all the time but most times they fail because people just take what is on the bottle and they say oh we're taking you know\nTwo hundred milligrams of whatever twice a day well that may be a generic prescription for well care but it may not really do the trick for someone who has a a challenge\nSo the idea is we utilize all of these substances I Need or intravenously in order to give the body a direct hit maintain the level keep the reserve that you need\nAnd that tends to work for patients and fairly quickly I might add a lot of times we start to have ... change in the manner in which we deliver the supplementation and his little as five weeks\nYou've said that before right that\n... the hydration the supplements whatever your overall protocols can work\nFairly quickly right and sometimes people have a hard time wrapping their head around the L moaning and media people in the chair here it's like I ... I mean I Believe I been okay easy for me I've been there and I've shorter so many\nPatients of yours over the years and I understand that and they said oh yeah I feel terrific I mean many times patient sit there and while you're getting your ivy you start talking what what what do you have what do you have many times I've said this was my last resort\nRight because my doctor said he couldn't do anymore that I came here and now I feel better desperation medicine and desperation medicine but if they would have came to your earlier would have been better would have been much better\nExactly we got to start thinking out of the situation that we're in and saying okay I Need to correct a medical challenge yeah okay great while you're walking around with this for five six years or whatever now get on this early on\nWellness is the wave of the future it's here right now yes and that's a fact\nCan you can your hydration and your supplements and your whole philosophy your whole protocols can they be used in preventative situated absolutely\nAnd more importantly it's it's really a good idea to start this at the initial diagnosis when you have something like a cardiac issue\nNow I Would say there's so many things ah ways by which the cardiologist traditionally can now come to say that a patient has\nA particular challenge all of that has changed for the better but again standard is still you go in if you're if if they think you have blockages you go in you have a ... and they sent you\nNow is sending a good thing well it's not a bad thing if it's going to keep you alive surely ideas how do we keep those stance from closing and that's where we come in and do a great job with it\nAnd obviously I'm a patient and that's one of the things the allergies I have yeah because I'm now coming up on almost three years wrote attack right\nAnd I had one hundred percent blockage they stand in for and then you put me on your protocols and there are some prescription beds of course is one prescription but they use for this right and so you are protocols are addressing\nThat issue among some of the other issues exactly which is the point as you said is to keep the stand open\nExactly John and you know like I have ... patients who come in to see me today and I'm always blown away because you sort of think of cardiac issues being put on the shelf there's been so many new developments yes but they'll come in and they may have four or five cents\nWell guess what after the first one I Would have been in my chair [laughter] better the point yeah you know uh because what you want to do is keep those arteries paint and you want to keep those vessels has Payton is possible keeping that blood flow flowing\nAnd so there are many things we can do including using the key leaders which call out the junk as you know and\nAgain the cardiac nutrition\nBut in terms of congestive heart failure you know it can be managed with medication it can be managed with medication\nAnd in addition to that if you use proper cardiac nutrition which we have a protocol for can we strengthen the heart muscle the answer is yes yes\nYou've talked about this procedure and I want to see where it fits in to the cardiac issue and the ... that that\n... when the cardiology people go in and they reset\nThe timing on heart for lack of a better word in other words people are having a ... people are having those kinds of things and you have to be careful with this because you can have a stroke people have this problem is the heart you know starts to get out of sequence\nThey can have a stroke so it's a very important process yes ablaze but again there are some cardiac nutrition that\nCan help this a blazing again a do its job and I would tell you it's a very interesting thing and I urge anybody to come into the office and see me because I have the data that's been compiled by a very well known physician\nI'm ... ... to tell you that cardiac nutrition is is extremely important as\nCancer supportive care [noise] and\nPeople always ask you what do I take it what what's a supplement I take for heart\nCo enzyme Q. ten we know that everybody hears it all over TV 'cause I was in his what form at how many milligrams what's appropriate for the patient and again this takes a little time uh in addition to that we might look at something like\nA some herbal preparation hostile on has been shown to be very helpful for people with uh congestive heart failure our junior\nOur Juno which is an Indian are very helpful so again you got to learn how to use those things along with the hydration\nAnd is the hydration a combination of those things many\nThousand right medic looting including things that are specifically related to the cardiac overall heart cell health for example there are specific cardiac sugars that only work with the cells in the cardiac area\nSo this whole process has changed tremendously big time in twenty two year yeah big time because I remember it was ... that was the thing\nWas it at our late friend her home we're used to talk about race you know that right or a long time and he just continually talked about that he swore by that right right and ... and it's certainly and I remember initially when I got it\nThe ... it really helped my cholesterol level\nIt did so did many did improve blood flow to ... percent right the question is you've got to understand that as we go through life are cardiac system are cardiac has been assaulted every which way our foods\nToxic in the air you name it John she's the our lifestyle sedentary next right we go from the car to the office you know why don't Europeans have the same type of cardiac issues we have you know why they walk everywhere exactly\nWe're hates that if we would do that if we would follow the right type of lifestyle changes we can live to be a hundred and twenty\nAbsolutely but we go from the house or the car to the office right back to the car and when you're at home you're on the computer in fact\nThat's an interesting thing because now you know the big push for the young folks is that they have these computer desk that rise up for you to stand up and your computer work\nThat's a good thing because it helps ... exactly I mean and that's kind of simple things like that but God has given us a whole lot of nutrient to help us in the cardiac arena\nWhere we're too sedentary is basically what you're saying among other things like\nThat and carrying bed diets\nWhat's the one thing if you want to tell a heart patients or to potentially avoid heart problems what's the one thing you could\nTell I Would say everybody should walk now Dr Molly walks at least eight blocks a day\nEight bucks a day I Know and um I really get out there to do it and that that's not much really um of course we zoom around the the ah the facility to but\nYou know sitting down and your job is tough John ... what are you doing you're behind a radio Mike and he said I ... the most time and so that's the key to the idea is if you can get out there and do some appropriate exercise Zimbabwe because\nI Am not telling you to go out and become a weekend warrior against your cardiology\nA console no please listen to your cardiologist and do something it correctly said good physical therapist who can help do that with you or you know I have Dr Carroll yes uh you can see a an exercise physiologist I mean there are so many things\nBut getting back to the nutritional supplementation there are many out there and with the you know with the new\nApproach with stem cells and by the way John people are getting ... I hear this all the time they're flying out to New Mexico they're flying to Mexico itself they're going to you were to get this\nAnd they're paying like thirty five thousand fifty thousand I had a guy came back\nHe's from Delaware and he tells me oh I spent fifty thousand dollars\nA doctor mowing I'm not sure the stem cells are doing anything for my congestive heart failure I said well what are you doing for your congestive heart failure what have you changed and so we talked about it and I said well I'm not charging anywhere near fifty thousand dollars\nBut I Would tell you that the nutritional piece of the stem cells it's not enough to just put the new cells in you want them\nTo sort of congenial and do their job so you're going to need some nutrition you're going to need some growth factors you've heard me say this ongoing um cellular nutrition what what what can't people understand so we do have a program\nFor that you notice like it reminds me of when you plant grass seed you better if you gotta you gotta put fertilizer and you've got ... got to nurture it right you don't just throw the streets down\nWell apparently a lot of places are doing that in charging plenty for what how I you know we just you know my physicians and myself we just have a different philosophy our philosophy is we want to look on a cellular level when I'm a biochemist by trade I don't pretend to be a physician\nBut I can tell you that my physicians look at things like the ... cycle when I'm not going into that folks just look it up that crabs cycle is a cycle of life it's done every minute of every day you're alive is what how cellular function is in your entire body had to do\nThey learn the crabs cycle when they're in medical school and if something is a biochemist you better know\nAnd I will tell you that that that holds the key for lots of this you need to have certain substrates and inhibitors to make the cells work at\nAppropriate levels are functionality that's it and then not show otherwise not going to do is you know it's not going to do any good for you know you spend or whatever for the stem cells and and you don't put any fertilizer on it\nMore to talk about here on the show it's health watch every Sunday eleven 'til noon they're on news talk nine Ninety where with Dr Molly fantasia\nWho is the PHD doctor the executive director and founder of innovative medical associates with two locations Marlton New Jersey and in Galloway New Jersey you have questions for Dr Molly you have a medical challenge you have an issue but time for you to call in eight seven seven nine nine zero WN to pay eight seven seven nine nine zero nine\nSix eight seven with Dr Molly fantasia I'm your host job to Massey were coming back more of health watch after these words", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Philadelphia", "day": "07"}
