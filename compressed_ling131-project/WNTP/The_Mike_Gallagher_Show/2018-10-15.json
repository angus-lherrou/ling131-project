what you call them now and hundred and six five by shutting some light on the Saturday this going on here right now for me would you please\nCome back to my and the only factor dot com studio [laughter]\nPresident last night a wide ranging interview to Leslie stall lots of gotcha questions\nShe likes that but you know what I didn't some people I got a lot of people pushing back saying that her she was trying too hard to track him or whatever I don't I don't necessarily agree with that I mean I watched the whole interview she had her moments where she was trying they're all going to do that\nTo him you know and they're not going to do that they didn't do that to ... how many times did you ever see any any who was it wasn't a steep Croft who always sat down with bronco bomber from sixty minutes\nI mean do crop of sixty minutes we're always sat down with Obama and they never did these gotcha kind of questions but in fairness to them [laughter] I Know that's that's painful for me to say Donald Trump has a different\nDifferent bird he's a different character he's nothing like any other president we've ever seen any relishes the fight he doesn't mind fighting\nHe doesn't matter he doesn't matter it doesn't matter to him he doesn't mind go ahead Leslie stall give me your\nBest shot you got to try to take me on I'll turn around and say I'm president you're not [laughter] threat during her sort of speechless I mean it it's true for\nEverybody who's texted me on my pillow text line right now at eight hundred six five five my for people to chat room at Mike online dot com who are watching the show on your computer and you're making comments about how tough she was and that the unfair questions of course that's going to go with the territory for him\nAnd he said that he said that he was\nVery surprised one of those one of the things that I was was impressed by in this conversation last night with Leslie stall [noise] was how he admitted and I read this before about him he's admitted\nThat he is surprised that the media never give him credit for anything which to me suggests kind of a good faith\nAttitude on his part yeah they don't like me they don't like my style and brash and crash I ah I mix it up with everybody but I thought that at least give me credit for this booming economy\nI thought they'd give me credit for record unemployment in America I thought that give me credit for unheard of approval ratings in the black community in the Hispanic community I thought they'd give me credit for record low unemployment for women for minorities I\nFirst of all Lesley Stahl asked the president about\nThis or the possibility that the Saudi Arabians that the Saudis rather killed a Washington Post journalist in the embassy in Turkey the guy was gene going in and he'd been a critic of the king and the Saudi hierarchy\nAnd uh he\nWent into the embassy and was never seen coming out now there's a report that\nHe actually recorded his own killing on his apple watch\nSomething about the way the the watches connected to the cloud and he had a recording going and the authorities the uh figured out a way to get it off the cloud it's just awful and the president was very very strong in condemning\nOr the possibility that he was that this man was murdered his number one this is of audio and video courtesy of CBS is sixty minutes and ... ... what\nHarold my buddy what to take care [laughter] you know there's a lot to say there's a lot of sick and [noise]\nLet me especially sell because this man was a reporter [noise] to something you'll be surprised me say that if something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're going to have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nIs very strong and his condemnation has very forceful denunciation of what could possibly be the Saudis um murder in this guy in their embassy\nBut the bottom line here is that the ... the president cannot get a break from the media and we get that we understand it I liked watching the CNN or the sixty minutes interview last night because frankly I kept saying to myself\nAnd this was a a point I made this morning with a with a buddy of mine if you've been in a coma and you woke up yesterday just in time to watch the sixty minutes interview you think wow this guy's a breath of fresh air because the American people really elect a guy like this\nLook at the issue of climate change people on the left are so worried about the condition of the planet and I shouldn't say people on the left a lot of us are worried we're not oblivious just because some of us happened to be conservative doesn't mean we're we want the planet\nTo be harmed by\nAny man made formula\nNow ... you look at the condition anecdotally pollution rates are so low um smog in Los Angeles things of the past you see things that are ... definitely changing emission standards are so high right now we're careful as a culture\nAbout what we put into the air and the water we really are way more than we're used to be is it enough well people get\nApoplectic about climate change used to be called global warming now they changed the climate change and the president's address last night to Leslie stall sort of suggested the way I Believe most normal Americans feel on this difficult subject yeah things might be changing they'll change back\nThey too hot it's too cold a few miles to dry it's too wet that's what the climate does but the president and the president acknowledged last night on sixty minutes\nThat you know maybe it's not a hoax it's not necessarily a hoax he's just not sure that man is to blame\nFor climate change\nAnd furthermore he said it's going to all change back was his when he said and again this to me is what\nNormal people kind of think this is the way people talk this is the way people feel most of us aren't activists\nMost of us aren't extreme on one side or the other and there's a lot of extremists in the climate change controversy let's listen to gather to what the president said cut number two again from this ah really extensive\nPretty comprehensive chat that the president had with Leslie stall of sixty minutes\nSee you don't think that climate change as a ... [noise] the I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that his man made I Will say this um\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland and\nWatch this huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean raising the the level and hey you don't know whether or not that\nWith or without man you don't know if you're a scientist who your scientists don't know\nOf us that disagree with that you know I I was thinking might have said now I've seen the hurricane situation I changed my mind and really as climate change and I thought oh what an impact\nWhat an enlightened way I think I'm not denying climate change it could very well go back you know we're talking about it all out of the news they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with like a sense that they say when they say that and they know what if I'm a scientist and say it's worse than having\n[noise] you have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda us like campaign finance is also have a political agenda\nThat he he talks like normal people talk frankly he talks like we talk he thinks like we think\nThere are scientists who are divided on this subject there's no settled science here he's right for every scientist who will tell you the United states of America is creating them contributing to the demise of the planet and the polar bears aren't going to have any ice in ten years\nYou could find another scientist says no no\nNot true there's all these different patterns and it's there's no direct attribution or proof that man is contributing to the destruction of the planet that's rhetoric invest hyperbole\nI'm not a scientist I don't know the answer I don't I don't I I don't pretend to I'm just telling you there is a debate there is an ongoing debate and it's okay to acknowledge that there's ongoing debate yeah the climate is changing their hurricanes it's wet it's dry it's hot it's cold you know I mean\nAll this stuff that has thrown I bought a thrown out by people who worship at the altar of climate change is refuted and again I don't know what site is right\nThe president doesn't either he's just not sure man is causing climate change so those are the kinds of things that this president says that are refreshing that are appealing the\nRasmussen daily tracking presidential poll came out today he's he's holding steady at fifty one percent according to Rasmussen the majority of likely voters approve of the job he's doing in spite of all that as being thrown at him\nAlmost every hour of every day [noise]\nRespect and she wouldn't be she was interrupt every time he tried to answer she's ... she's walking all step it up all over the answer's\nYes he says it's not the way in the past that people are treated the president in the United states\nWell it's yeah and that's that's par for the course I get there is not one thing you said that I disagree with in terms of who you know what really played out and how that played out\nBut it's business as usual and as long as he continues to be large and in charge and confident and cool and collected and fired when he needs to be\nHey it's our it's I'm fine with it I Would I ...
