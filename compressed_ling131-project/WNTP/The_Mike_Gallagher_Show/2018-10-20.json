J. C. is really organic juicing made simple so tell everybody about the organic Jews\nClans and why you call it quote unquote game changer\nOh yeah absolutely well we know that you sing is sweeping in Asia and we know it's super healthy\nBut the problem is you know it's messy and it's a big hassle it takes a long time buying the produce that clean them and that's why I created the organic juice Clinton's because it's juicing made simple\nIt's the short could it's the easy way to get more organic fruits and vegetables into your system every single day pat each supersized scoop it's got thirty different super food like broccoli spinach kale partially blueberries cranberry strawberries ...\nBerry all certified organic it tastes great it's got a great Barry apple greens flavor and since it's made with real organic produce when your\nBody starts to absorb these organic fruits and veggies and berries it makes a huge difference you feel revitalize rejuvenated you feel energy and it doesn't take long past if you're the kind of person it's just getting very few or no fruits and vegetables every day you're probably going to notice the difference the very first day you use it\nNow Dr eleven it's a toxic world out there but\nWhen it comes to consuming lots of fruits and vegetables to help the body\nPlans to feel healthy you say don't exacerbate the problem by using fruits and vegetables with pesticides and herbicides now\nThe organic juice cleanse clearly helps in that department right I mean I look at it the label I see organic broccoli spinach parsley barley grass wheat grass raspberry strawberries all organic I mean this sounds first of all delicious and super healthy\nAll right I mean juicing let's face it it's a great idea\nBut I don't like using commercial produce that's Laden with pesticides herbicides and phones I mean I Want to concentrate\nUp the vitamins and minerals antioxidants the fighter nutrients but I certainly don't want to concentrate the pesticides right and that's why I Love this organic juice twins because it's organic choosing without the mask without the hassle\nPesticide residues on it and samples of celery cherry tomatoes imported snap peas and strawberries each had Thirteen different pesticide residues on them now I don't want to scare you away from eating more fruits and vegetables and in fact quite the opposite is true for years now I've been promoting eating more\nFruits and vegetables but the point is it's so nice that when OJ see there are going to choose Clinton's you're getting thirty different organic super foods you're getting their ...\nVegetables berries all the super foods and you're getting them organically nature intended and you're leaving behind what you don't want because it doesn't have any of the pesticides herbicides or fungus arts\n... and we're talking today about purity is brand new organic juice cleanse the Barry surprise addition this is their next generation O. J. C. is new and improved now has sixty seven percent more fiber than their previous O. J. C. plus a liver detox support blend along with a mouth watering array of twenty five\nDifferent organic super fruits and vegetables\nBut this sixty seven percent more fiber that must really helped to keep things moving talk to me about it\n[laughter] I like the way you put that and\nMost of my patients aren't getting nearly enough fiber in fact according to the journal of the American diet headaches association\nOnly five percent of us are getting enough fiber that's a disaster because fiber promotes healthy Bal movements you know you need to have a bowel movement at least once a day that's critical you have to clean up their tree our track but on top of that fiber motel the cholesterol levels triglycerides blood sugar\nPatty promote a healthy body weight many people when they start adding fiber to their diet to actually drop a few pounds and pretty common it promotes digestion it promotes absorption of nutrients it even reduces bad breath and body odor so fiber is an all around great thing to have\nThe USDA the American Heart Association the national Cancer Institute they all promote getting more fiber and if you're not getting enough fiber O. J. C. has a full\nFive grams of both soluble an insoluble fiber you eat the food extract the nutrients and then you want to get the waste out of your system rapidly that's what Barbara does for us\nNow doc I'm looking at the list of ingredients here and it sounds amazing I mean you've got the organic blueberries you've got the strawberries the cranberries the red raspberries you've added organic broccoli spinach kill parsley we'd crass oath grass green tea ... berry apples beach I mean even at a delivery support one plus of\nFull five grams of fiber this is quite a list and it's all organic right\nOh yeah I mean this is an amazing compilation of nutrients all carefully chosen for this specific benefits that\nThey deliver we're talking parrot through the eyes beats black current digestive enzymes for digestion\nI had a fire Lena unclear roller those blue green analogies that are super healthy for his parents are paying magazine brings ... as the number one super food for extending your lifespan and ... supports the liver and heavy metal detoxification\nI added flaxseed important for a man's prostate good source of omega threes partially is a great one that's full of ...\nGreat for the heart and the arteries but also with fights bad breath a new one senator a Barry rate for energy powerfully antioxidant and it's great for sharp focus and concentration and when you get these super foods these organic super foods into your system\nEvery day it's not subtle folks you noticed a big difference especially those who've you get very few fruits and vegetables you're going to notice a difference the very first day you use it\nThat Dr Levin a friend of mine wanted to do a juice clients and spent probably close to two hundred dollars by one of those in the store with a handful of fresh fresh juices and I mean it's a fortune just for a three day clans and what do you do after that talk about this and how often do you want people taking O. J. C. D. organic juice clans\nRight I've seen those on line two hundred dollars for a three day Clemens I mean what the heck are you going to do after that you do a Clinton's once a year or twice a year and then that's it I mean\n... to your breathing chemicals once or twice a year every day every day the eat foods that have pesticides and herbicides and contaminants once or twice a year every day every day every day right so cleansing detoxify\nIsn't something you do once or twice a year I knew him would your shower once or twice a year now\nSo the bottom line is we want to think about getting this toxic junk out of our systems on a regular basis no\nThe first way you do that is making sure you have enough fiber because that's how you flush out that gee aren't tracked that's why we have a full five grams of fiber in New York and accused queens but secondly delivers port ... can be broccoli the milk and all the super\nFoods to fight a nutrient berries they go to work helping the liver to cleanse him to talk so far the system and they do it every single day because you come in contact with toxins\nEvery single day to\nUse the OJ see every single day because this is a supplement for defies the body it adds to super foods antioxidants afraid of nutrients the vitamins and minerals and at the same time it supports your liver and its job to cleansing detoxify your system\nRight to recap the big story today purity products is giving away free bottle of their new next generation organic juice clans power packed\nWith thirty organic super fruits and veggies and the five grams of fiber to book plus the free shaker bottle as well today and not top of that for the first one thousand callers from today's show you're going to get a bottle you're awesome B. twelve energy melts\nThat's incredible but Dr Levin if there was one thing you wanted our listeners to take away from today's show what would it be\nWell I guess bottom line I mean my patients they're just not getting enough fruits and vegetables on a regular basis I mean the FDA the national Cancer Institute the American Heart Association they want us getting seven to nine servings of fruits and vegetables or pay no one's doing that and yeah juicing\nThis is a popular option and it works great but let's face it it's a huge hassle it takes forever plus the cost of going out and shopping and buying all that produce gets really expensive\nAnd that's what I Love about the organic choose Clinton's dishes juicing made simple it's the easy way to get these thirty different super foods we've been discussing here today into your system every single day so what do you notice you notice you feel better you feel super charged you feel sharper\nAnd this is going to happen to pretty much everybody out there that tries O.

with an advertisement high purity products these they have not been evaluated by the FDA this product is not intended to diagnose treaty or prevent any diseases\nThe proceedings ... commercials like program sponsored by period products up and discussed on this program to not necessarily the place ... this is Michael\nA they don't release details and then the overtime destroyed the records of their uh\nUh examinations and and uh\nUm some of the regulatory issues with giant banks but the reason I think this is significant as as I said you went very quickly\nDuring that period in the early part of the twentieth century from a\nA really strong stable well capitalized institution to one that was needing\nA heavy government assistance and and in the in the years since then I think often people have blamed as they did and oh wait particular financial businesses are instruments in other words when they talk about Glass Steagall this idea that you want to separate a [noise]\nA commercial banking taking deposits making loans from investment banking a trading in the securities markets et cetera but what we found and this is true in no way we were able through the uh\nUh through a freedom of Information Act request to get a a a document from the FDIC that showed that\nBasically you had problems across the city group enterprise in other words from the most simple loans to the most complex Wall Street financial instruments you see a recurring problem it's consistent and it is an over investment in housing\nAnd we can talk about all the incentives for the government gave people prior to that crisis to invest in housing but I think what one conclusion you drawn from this is that the problem is that\nIs a perception that that the firm will not be allowed to fail\nWhatever the particular financial instrument is because it tells creditors that they don't need to worry they don't need to be as rigorous as they would otherwise be lending their money to a giant bag like city\nThere's been this no relationship between city\nPolitical figures let's try to connect the dots if we can for a bit here and if we go back in I guess maybe we did back further you you had more of a history behind us and talent in that area\nFor me I tend to gravitate back to win at some point did they did the White House get hijacked\nBy bankers and if we look at Ronald Reagan who came in to office and he had Don Regan come in from Merrill Lynch and really Reagan got a seat at the table and\nThere was Chrysler having troubles and financial engineering starting to\nTo come of age and maybe it happened before that but then you get Clinton who comes to office and creates a whole new cabinet position if I recall for\nFor Reuben and win Reuben supposedly was at Goldman Sachs and a lot of this comes from a book about the fed chairman Greenspan [laughter]\nIn the history of Greenspan in the evolution of where we are today hear Goldman Sachs snakes that that boy look at the power of the Republicans and coming off of Reagan and the amount of money coming in the troughs we can get a good value we're basically the Democrats are value stock to us\nAnd let's go ahead and start to raise the money Ruben gets it apparently a new cabinet position if I recall or or something along those lines\nFor the treasury secretary's are up obviously couldn't couldn't have been more powerful a within the cabinet and obviously yes his Wall Street background I think gave him I'm even more authority or within the Clinton Administration\nWhat's interesting is he didn't come in is that right he gravitate attacks I knew he was a little bit sour because he ... he got to this you know the lesser position and there was a whole Mexico\nSo bailout that had to take place so anyway let's go into connecting the dots of why these bankers are ending up in the White House and then eventually they all seem to fall back on an organization like city or the lake\nI don't know why we're going to go back to his roots in Goldman but he seemed to sound the home or\nAnd even some said folks had gone consulting firms and then get hired by these institutions I'm not going on facts you would know more and I don't want to be\nConspiracy theorist but maybe you can open that up and connect some of the dots of some of the movers and shakers that we know of recent and how they ended up as part of this whole structure a house of cards if he called a big financial institutions getting bigger and bigger and then then leaving washing tend to go back\nTo almost like this retirement home\nI'm just too big to fail institutions\nThat revolving door it's called but I I think do you and all of us are taxpayers are our right to be very concerned about\nAh what seems to be a cycle of a high level people moving back and forth between the largest financial institutions that in the government and also in this recent history you see over and over again a government or the or the federal government or\nA exercising a extreme patience with a with a stumbling giant like city which would not be tolerated typically in a smaller institution you see that in the in the seventies when say the uh\nUh over did it a loaning money to a developing country governments in the eighties they overdid it on us commercial real estate we get into the oh wait prices\nAnd and they are once again I'm\nOver extended themselves on on us real estate and they get\nAn enormous amount of government assistance or roughly a half a trillion dollars are ultimately\nUm in in various forms of eight assistance credit whatever and\nAnd yes at the same time through this history a UC ... disturbing pattern where a a Robert Ruben you mentioned for example goes from a [noise] a being a Clinton treasury secretary and\nAnd uh after a very short period he joins a city group and this is\nBasically just as a legislation which\nHelps city is on its way to the president's desk in terms of uh uh finally tearing down the lives of those Glass Steagall restrictions in this case it was allowing the city of new city holding company do have a banking and insurance under the same roof [noise]\nUm you see it in the oh wait a crisis in that era Jack Lew\nA prominent Democrat or goes to city a chief operating officer over to city group units that had a a tremendous problems are in during the crisis years\nAnd then he based on the amazing way based on that track record he ended up as the treasury secretary under President Obama's so um and and even the the details of his separation ... he received a bone is from city because he was going to a job in the\nUh high level job and the government and and that was the\nContract that was set up but you do have to wonder when people leave a giant bank and they then go into government or at a senior position [noise] are they going to look out for that a former farm in a way they don't for [noise] for smaller competitors\nWe're speaking with teams Freeman he is the assistant editor of the wall Street Journal's editorial page he also served in the securities and Exchange Commission and eat penned a fantastical borrowed time we're hearing about the history how does it relate now to what's happening [noise] well\nI think we we hope to avoid a crisis like we did the last time I I we talked about\nHow we for years afterward people we're dealing with the aftermath of that crisis or are there was an enormous amount of a government spending and and regulating that resulted we've had a a period of a\nA mostly very slow growth obviously improving now but as we think about how do we avoid this situation where we're giant firms are encouraged to take risks with\nA belief among investors that the government will bail them out if necessary how do we get back to the system in which\nFinance just like in every other industry we all work and people are allowed to succeed and they're allowed to fail and you have that market discipline which works as we've seen in this history so much better than [noise]\nThan the regulatory discipline which which turns to\nThe lead to these kind of crises so I think part of it is you would hope there is now a a a an effort to try and shrink that safety net look for ways for the government to to signal that it's it's no longer going to save a\nLot of stumbling giant from failure and basically allow people to succeed and to fail\nIt's your life your well show I'm Steve her desk go and we're talking about a book that I highly recommend you go out grab read it's called borrowed time by James Freeman bird McKinley or we're gonna come back we're going to talk more about the Federal Reserve and whether or not we will ever get to a truly fool free market\nSystem without maybe set involvement in\nToo big to fail institutions manipulating the system [noise]\nDating back more on your life you were around in just a moment [noise]\nWar is the only ones out there are powerful enough or we the people\nWho can only do it through changing the way that we've been accustom\nTo buying goods and services and that's with going off of the current monetary system onto a new grid of a new monetary system\n[noise] well I think uh the uh there are a lot of interesting technologies that could allow people different ways the trans act outside of what you might call the traditional banking system um as far as the fed I I think\nWe should be having a debate about their power and authority\nI think it's not a a a plus for our economy that they gain still more a regulatory power after the crisis I'm\nAnd I'm I think maybe the first step would be transparency I'm so you'd like to be able to look back in history and and evaluate the\nJob that the fed is doing where did they make mistakes where did they do right it's very hard to do that because as I said they have this kind of regular\nCalendar of document destruction so we wanted to know exactly how did they help city in the early Nineteen nineties than a memorandum of understanding a city had a\nAt over done it as we said on us commercial real estate you'd like to be able to go back and study how are these problems handled our they resolved\nEvery opportunity I've had to address a Federal Reserve either chairperson or somebody who was a board member 'cause they rotate on and off\nAnd I ask the question about transparency I seem to get the same response and that is well we are transparent we're not obligated to but we voluntarily that's been the actual verb it's used\nTo go in front of Congress and\nDo our state of whatever it is the economy but they go and they can ask questions and to then the fed used that as open transparency because the whole public can watch the escapade\nOn TV I remember CNBC watching as they were watching Greenspan whether he was holding the pre K. than his left hand her right hand as he's walking the street and his London fog trench coat about to head up to the hill to address\nThe Senate Finance committee on what's going on within the Federal Reserve\nYeah I mean there there is some transparency we can see the size of their balance sheet we know uh basically\nWhat types of assets they've been buying since the crisis there there's transparency on some things they are subject to an audit but I I think there's a lot especially in their supervision of of giant banks that we'd we'd like to be able to see\nWhat can people do today average everyday people call them so the little guy that or maybe just a small account at one of these big institutions what can we the people do to gain power to change kind of being under the\nCommand of these financial institutions who make us all almost have to pay homage\n[noise] well I guess for the for the small ah a deposit or the the um\nI think this is good news that they're that they're raising rates or I you know it's we've had this period where because the uh economy was in such bad shape and and uh obviously the crisis we've discussed they had\nA heart rate's very close to zero fraud and at roughly zero for a long time and they've come up a bit but\nBut uh this is where I guess I Would\nUh different from the president while I think it's fine to criticize the fed I think it's actually a healthy thing that they're raising rates more toward what we might call it a normal interest rate environment is is going to allow that individual saver to get a final issue some my interest on their deposits I think people are looking at their\nTheir savings accounts banks for IRS wondering when they're going to get paid so I think that's a a that's a positive\nThe Federal Reserve is made up of individuals and there's a board and there's appointments and those in power positions kind of hold the ranking for a number of years through past administrations those seats at the table have not been fully appointed\nTrump seems sort of quietly just like he's filled the courts quietly quietly filled those seats at the table can you share that story\nIs part of a larger story really a a tremendous set of appointments from the cabinet and then across the government highly qualified people so that race it employment\nWe don't have obviously Jay Powell who was a a a member of the fed is now the chairman appointed by the president a key job is another big higher recently is Randall corals so this was the open position running the fed supervision of financial institution so he's the vice chairman and that this is a\nA highly powerful position I\nI think I'm too powerful but uh uh one thing that I I think you're talking about the average person I think he what you would hope is that\nThere would be less of a button encroachment or by the fed throughout the whole financial economy there there's a term of um the\nPeople at the fed and other regulatory institutions like to use my college shadow banking and by this may mean essentially\nParts of the financial system but they don't control but would like to and I think there's a great deal of effort by regulators to suggest that uh the\nFinancial activities that are outside a\nLittle control of bank regulators and also outside the safety net must be a somehow bought inside because that will sort of cure to er whisks but of course we're what we want as a financial system that allows risk it allows\nPeople to to invest as long as they understand that if the investment doesn't go well they can lose money you need that that's a really critical part of our\nOf our system but I I think one thing that also should be clear when you look at the history is that a\nA bank regulation is is not a a way to make everything said fit it brings enormous risk and what we saw over and over again researching this book is is what's come to be called regulatory capture the the regulators even if they are\nUm heavily involved with the giant bank typically are the last to know when there's a problem and you you see it over and over again you saw that at city in two thousand seven two thousand eight an enormous numbers of federal regulators are overseeing\nCity and yet\nA largely unaware of the\n... over investment in real estate and the\nDisasters that began\nGenerating a multibillion dollar losses in the fall of two thousand seven\nFascinating stuff James Freeman even a fantastic as the book that you have ten borrowed time\nTwo centuries of booms bust bailouts at city this massive financial institution is a great read I highly recommend people pick it up and the work you do right now as assistant editor at the wall

Marshall PHD this is help line line Let's go to one in Miami and he's got a question about magnesium is linked to blood pressure go ahead and one\nOf my shell thank you I was going you because\nI have a go um I was string for an Iron Man I I like to do enjoy sports and while extreme I developed my check to make a long story short active up to the hospital and get a budget cuts and then after many cats are discovered that I had to hide the crash\nAt that time I watch them there I tremendous amount of stress strings ... an endless sport I had I didn't read anything about ... you might get annoyed about it and I I got to take a medication my luck I actually thought that the medication\nI Wish we had a habit how do I know um if they'd be so why is it out of high blood pressure I I got kind of how to create what because I was making him when I look at my cash no way to the show when like me she lego car\nNo it won't and the reason is that um blood tests for magnesium are pretty much useless because I'm magnesium is held in the blood by adrenaline\nAnd in my opinion it's unlikely that the magnesium was the problem or it's more likely that you sweat very heavily you depleted salt you ate food that may have had bugs in it and it got carte blanche to the circulatory tree\nThat's the most common phenomena\nThat links as to uh issues with blood pressure's so could it be magnesium yeah but it'd be real hard to tell you could go in a good drug store now stick your arm in there and see what your blood pressure is no cause no obligation\nTo get an idea of where you are now what I see over and over again with athletes like you is you sweat very heavily and you're not paying attention to salt\nNow most Americans in my opinion eat too much salt\nBut athletes especially in ... athletes anybody doing anything and Durant often deplete salt so the way you can test this one is when you break a sweat you'll reach over to the upper outer part of your arm\nAnd taste the perspiration it should too you taste slightly salty not anybody else you if it doesn't you need to take a teaspoon of salt like air drives sea salt or better yet are pink so\nFor two or three days until you break the sweat and you can taste it then I Would cut back and hide monitor that so I always have a slightly salty taste [noise]\nNow you have plenty of hydrogen Laura casket and no little bug can get past your stomach okay now if you're still want to support healthy blood pressure and when you go and check your blood pressure\nYou may want to go on something like cardio PG how old are you know how much the way\nI'm forty five and I wear a hundred and eighty pounds\nYou show you'd want probably about ... four teaspoons of cardio PG than you would use that for about four months\nAnd that's designed to promote the best health for the circulatory tree and then if you maintain your salt but you're getting old enough that salt might not even do the job for you\nYou really probably should begin taking a couple of quantum died just at the start of Maine cooked meals\nAnd then at the end of the meal or maybe three to four detained ... now you have the ... times you had a twenty\nAnd nothing gets passed those guys so uh I think you may be fooled by what's going on here okay I'm magnesium is famous for heart rhythm and for any issue with heart rhythm I'm but I'm not so much for the blood pressure itself\nOK okay thank you very much You're welcome but um [noise]\nAll right let's go right back to the phones let's go to Chris in California and they're trying to conceived ... nine months and the fertility ... says her husband has a very conceal alright are you there Christian\nCollege and how old is your husband try a anyway how\nCan so what does the doctor recommend for this\nCat only having ... and our laws are falling to see your parents have\nCell and that type of family that guy that research [noise] kind of about that for the answer to that really\nIt's amusing to me they didn't let you know all the options\n[laughter] had me\nThis is because sometimes is selling one option and not another um but you know you read proverbs it says through the council of many wise men wise plans of made so you know just listen to one guy\nIncluding including me okay\nI have no financial axe to grind okay which is quite different so I agree that there could be a circulatory issue I don't agree that the circulatory issues solution is necessarily that surgery\nIt may be that he played sports and he's had his incurred an interference field of
