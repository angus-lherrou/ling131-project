state of Georgia Senator Burr do welcome it's great to talk to you want to hear are you supporting judge capping off\nA hundred percent this is a total sham Hugh you wrote about it earlier this week this is a a real version back to McCarthyism by the Democrats I mean it is outrageous that character assassination\nThe Democrats are burning a very bedrock of our democracy and that is the presumption of innocence and this and this character assassination is the the new low in my time here in Washington it's just unbelievable you\nKnow your colleagues center Ernst told me earlier today that absence corroborating evidence of Dr Ford's testimony specifically she will be a yes or do you believe that the one Republicans will have that same standard apps and corroborating evidence of doc Ford's testimony\nI Do you I Believe that uh we've done everything we can from a\nChuck Grassley the chairman of the judiciary all the way down to this latest FBI investigation we done everything they've asked for there's absolutely no corroborating out as a matter of fact the Democrats say well this is just a he said she said and we have to decide who's telling the truth no it's more than that\nBecause she brought cooperating witnesses three who could not corroborate her story\nBut they did actually corroborate his story so I Believe that we will get fifty one votes later this week\nNow there are also troubles with her testimony and the president brought them up last night and he's been criticized but I got to tell you in the first Arab today show\nAnd I do this for the benefit of the audience or just turning and Kathy ... an invalid Sarah in Tampa and in Detroit Norma in Michigan Alexandra in Newport Beach Elaine in Louisville\nJeannie in Oregon Shelly in Columbus and in San Diego all first time caller to the show all women pan out of ten one cabinet confirmed nine out of ten applaud what the president did last night and yet the blue bubble media is attacking him for doing it what do you think senator ... do\nYou know who I travel my state a lot last couple of weeks and I hear from women all over they know that the dead rock founding principles of our founding mothers and fathers uh sacrosanct and this presumption of innocence cannot be waved around all the way the Democrats are doing it right now this is an absolute travesty\nFor the American justice system or I Can't wait to get him confirmed that\nThe Democrats are the ones that are conducting a war women by the way to the person that's been abused in this whole process is Dr for the Democrats promised to not revealed is this could have done been done confidentially which is what she wanted instead\nSomeone up here either in the Congress ones will Congress woman's office or in senator Feinstein's office somebody leak that letter\nAnd now after that game public is just outrageous and\nBy the way that shut three weeks after dying Feinstein head this letter she had her personal interview with judge Kavanaugh she didn't mention it at all there was a one\nWord of conversation about the letter when she met with him probably the first time\nThe officers been abused and I believe I've been thinking about this a lot 'cause I've never seen this kind of reaction I've been no radio since Nineteen Ninety [noise] is that a ten year old daughter and a fourteen year old daughter are going to be hearing about this from friends and photos and cheap shots for the rest of their lives they're going to hear their\nFather accused of being a gang rape is they're going to hear their father accused of being a drug and it's all without any kind of precedent and I think Americans are revolt by that center up or do\nYou this is what's going on let me let me give you some close to the Democrats\nMy wife was physically accosted this week at the airport here in Washington I was physically accosted by members of the center of public democracy now these people are funded by the open society foundation that's George Soros\nHe has put thirty to listen to this thirty two billion that's with a B you in that organization of the last few years this is open warfare here's what senator Booker said\nGet up in their face in some congresspeople Maxine Waters said they're not going to be able to go to the restaurant they're not going to be able to go to the gas station they're not going to be able to shop in the department store get up in their face absolutely harass them\nI mean this is not the America that I came to serve this is not the American that women back home on this is not the America that we fought and died for over the last two hundred years I'm telling you Maxine Waters Cory Booker a Nancy Pelosi shame on them you\nNancy poses I don't know why we aren't all apart while there aren't uprisings all over the country\nChairing Adler has threatened impeachment proceeding I Hope no one is taking that seriously because he did not live this whole controversy about drinking it's all manufactured the devil's triangle it's all manufacturing he did not lie and Jerry now they're threatening perjury proceeding is a joke does anyone take that seriously\nNo not appear not the people who know the facts I mean we've looked at the testimony we've heard all the witnesses I mean this is an absolute zero case there's not a district attorney in the world\nOr in the country that would have taken this to a judge\nFor prosecution I honestly I I think that you know when I'm\nWhen Chris Coons says a judge Kavanaugh's who's taken a lifetime appointed the Supreme Court and I'm reading this and who are now think bears the burden of disapproving these allegations that the U.S senators you\nI'm calling these guys out because this is the bedrock of what we fought for all these years I mean the presumption of innocence is what McCarthyism challenge and you call that our this is the closest thing to McCarthyism I've seen in the last fifty\nYears a last question do you think you'll be confirmed by Saturday\nI Do I think we should see or the FBI report you know even the Democrat said shouldn't take three or four days so we should see that as early as tomorrow and get the procedural vote on the way and before we leave this week we were told yesterday we will get a vote on him and I believe we'll get him confirmed\nReading news or the breakneck pace this yourself might Gallagher show we got a crucial journal lectured counted on November ... we're not going to make America great again it was never that\nThree ... voice of clarity for millions of Americans say for asking the questions are shown owned by the most famous man on the planet even grade Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly now from the relief factor dot com studios mice yellow\n[noise] you're ready for another day of the battles you strap them buckle up [noise] and hanging on\nFor dear life what a week this has been one a week there shall be the media in complete meltdown mode over the president's comments about Dr Christine Blasey Ford last night at his rally the media in complete meltdown over the New York times latest bombshell\nDecades ago President Trump's late father\nAnd mother had some tax team he's not as rich as he says he is a ha we got 'em again meanwhile the FBI\nKavanaugh investigation might wrap up today which will of course be another reason for the Democrats who oppose Brett Kavanaugh to say\nWell this wasn't sufficient they didn't even take a week they didn't even interview Christine Blasey Ford we're already hearing that we know what they're going to do because they are predictable if nothing else [laughter]\nThey're very very predictable there's a headline above the fold in today's USA Today that tells you everything you need to know about what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh and the way the direction we're in in the country and I loved it I Love how useful districts here's the headline and USA Today confirmation long and\nThe capping off fight\nBut your article says the battle over Kavanaugh's nomination to the court is unlikely to end with his confirmation vote Democrat shed very won't let go\nOf the sexual assault allegations\nEven if he's elevated to the high court if they win control of one or both houses of Congress in November they'll be in a position\nTo continue the fight it's almost like USA Today he's unintentionally confirming you better get out and vote [laughter] those it's almost like they're saying do you see Republicans what will happen if you stay home\nOn November the ... they're gonna they're not only are there are also going to do everything they can\nTo roll back every single Trump policy achievement of the last nearly two years we know that it is up to us all of this is up to wash\nNovember ... put it on your calendar\nI don't care if you're if you're in the hospital having wheel of a hospital bed into the ... the polling place drag your butt end to the polls and vote on November ... for Republicans because the USA Today article is a is a very very\nPowerful reminder of what is at stake and what is at stake here so let the Democrats control the candy store we've got to keep the house we got to keep the Senate\nAnd this nation will breeze a huge sigh of relief it's up to you now let's let's take care of this\nBecause this is going to be tough because you're probably not going to like\nEntirely what I have to say and that's all right hey you know I'm a big guy I can get somewhat ... [laughter] the president as you've heard by now had a rally last night when he was all where he was again on fire having\nA great time or\nTall and Mississippi after about a week and a half of being tremendously subdued about Christian gloves before\nBeing very careful about Dr Ford and not criticizing her are attacking her mocking her I was there was one tweet and that kind of blew over pretty quickly\nAnd other than that it's been pretty quiet about it you just kinda let this process play out he should have the other day in the oval office she found and credible seems like a fine woman that's where you said a few days ago well here it is ... this is what he said last night in Mississippi which has\nThe media um you know watching their heads explode once more as it often happens when the president says something very provocative I had\nOne beer [noise] right I Want to be [noise]\nWell do you think it was it was one man [noise] I'm good how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't know\n[noise] [noise] [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where's the house [laughter] sounds serious winter was I don't know what I mean that's the only thing\n[noise] I don't know\nMan visiting Saturn a man slices shattered\nAbout uh the first to me to take away is that Donald Trump being Donald Trump\nOr he he goes legit healer he responds viscerally he is he fights he battles\nAnd that's just him and and he that's what got them to the White House and he's going to keep doing it um until he leaves the White House hopefully\nIn six years my problem is that the base really doesn't have anything to do with this week my my concern is\nHis ... his his supporters in a rally at a rally in Mississippi really have nothing to do with playing out how this goes it is down to the to to a handful of senators your your your plane to a handful of people maybe the senators you can count on one hand\nAnd my fear is that\nIf one vote is loss because a senator believes that the accuser has been unfairly mock or taunted or attacked\nBut it wasn't worth I don't know what I don't know what the upside is so I'm not going to come to work and lie to you and pretend that I'm\nGlad\nThat he said something that I Wish you hadn't said I'm not I wish you hadn't said I've also always always worried about an uncorroborated accusation\nUm not necessarily be not true I don't know what happened thirty six years ago we never will we don't know if Brett Kavanaugh did it or not I happen to believe based on his life and his career and his record and his incredibly qualified\nResume he should be the next Supreme Court justice\nI don't believe that she has enough corrupt ration to seal the deal in making the case that he's unfit I Know what the the the the filthy game the Democrats your plane in moving the goal ... goalpost I understand completely\nHow vicious they've been and I\nDo share his concerns or along with the curtains or concerns of millions and millions of people about the smear campaign and how it can ruin somebody without any substantiate ... is a problem\nIt's a big problem and finally after a year of the the me too era\nWhen we're having a a national conversation about what happens when somebody has falsely accused I have a story in front of me there were some ... accused of rape and sexual assault in Las Vegas and it turns out that you use her made it up\nNow is your story is you don't hear often but they happen\nFor Dennis from California including three brothers who faced rape charges for the alleged assault of a woman at the when the Las Vegas had all the charges dismissed in court this week prosecutors dropped all the chargers\nOr one of the lawyers said after river review the facts it was clear that the allegations were completely fabricated to Fort dentists for professionals from California three of the brothers but faced ruined ...\nFrom what apparently was a completely fabricated claim this happened and when President Trump said this week I worry about today's boys I worry about being people being falsely accused I worry about like you said I've been falsely accused it can happen\nAnd I absolutely get it and I share those concerns in this case the case in this week and in this time we got to focus on these senators and get judge Kavanaugh across the finish line and again for for for where I sit there wasn't anything gained there was nothing achieved by the president\nI and I have even mild criticism I just don't want any I'm ... I'm just worried about these these these votes this week Keith that's all I'm focused like a laser job one get Kavanaugh confirmed job to get everybody to vote on November ... on November ...

perfect alternative to the arcade and we love visiting with him every week and he's got a very timely Paul he wants to tell us about a dime a Mac pull on judge Kavanaugh hello happy Wednesday Dan how are you\nRight to see again my I Love being on your show all love having you as well I mean people get mad at me today 'cause I'm a little bit uncomfortable little little\nQueasy about what the president said about Christine Blasey Ford last like where's the media is probably in him with over it nah no nothing new about that but I my I'm just focusing maybe perhaps I'm very myopic about this\nI'm worried about a few senators I just want to get Kavanaugh over the finish line right this was going to get down to the wire and I think everything is gone very well actually the last couple of days\nAnd there's a lot of momentum and I'm just I'm just nervous about anything interrupting that momentum but ah\nBut yeah and lots of support and I'm a I'm supporting the president a hundred and ten percent as a I Believe most of our listeners are and uh I one thing to say about him he even if he puts sends out a tweet that makes people say whoa he knows what he's doing seemingly the man knows exactly what he's doing\nAnd he's working at his job yeah the poll we took over the weekend Mike was great we ask that members if they should have delayed for one week and we were shot\nEighty five percent of our members of that's thirty three thousand people to the ball wow eighty five percent said no they shouldn't have delay the way they should have voted right away and I was shocked I mean in my opinion is the best candidate we've had for Supreme Court in my lifetime based on his record\nBased on the fact he knows the government based on his\nJudicial history this guy is a class by himself\nThe reason that the Democrats are or were flailing Dan is because they know how qualified he is it simply about judicial philosophy I I watch Chris Coons this morning the Democrat who's now joined the hip with Jeff Flake and\nThere's something going on the road and they've taken this show on the road now they're going everywhere and and appearing to gather Chris Coons admitted I don't like I don't want a conservative on the bench\nThat's out there that day and\nIt's a shame Ginsburg got Ninety ... some odd vote for Republicans and Democrats and she was ultra liberal so it's again they're not playing fair when we elect the president than we expect him to be able to appoint as judges when they expect when they elect the president like they did with Obama pointed his judges and we didn't\nLike with that as long as they qualified and this guy is eminently qualified right either that\nOr even Senator Lindsey Graham when he had his fiery speech which I think most of us she stood up insured for the other day yeah yeah but he even said hey when you see showed him I or or cake and you tell him I said Hi cause I voted for them and it was a powerful reminder that these guys Democrats don't play ball the way we do they don't they're not doing anything in good faith\nThat this is not in good to have\nWell I agree with you and they should be ashamed of themselves but you know what the American people are pretty smart and I think that we made a judgment so we know what's gonna happen and then just better not try to pull any more trucks from now until it gets going\nWill see they're ... they're trying everything they've got I I I I I Wish I could be optimistic I think they won't play play more games I'm Sasha you had over thirty two thousand members of a Mac vote because that's a great sampling and that's a you know to to to get an eighty five\nPercent I mean does it do you do you guys do this pretty regularly on on that point is\nEvery week we do a poll and this one is the the probably the highest the vote in awe of all the numbers who voted for a particular cause sense that we voted on Obamacare when I was far as best gotcha then there was\nFifty thousand people said it was a little while then but now now this is also very important to people like I like the Trump said he could appoint judges and these are wondering judges and I remember as a happy with\nThat is why this is so important that white getting capital confirmed are so crucial because\nFor many of us this is validation of why we went and pull the lever for him in

evidently no the identity of the person who sent the packages investigators say the envelopes address the defense secretary James Mattis\nThe Navy's top officer admiral John Richardson\nContainer return address leading them to believe that came from the sailor whose name has not yet been disclosed but they are on it and uh\nI'm confident that law enforcement will get to a conclusion of this but I Want to get in and this is reminiscent to me of when the board Bernie Sanders supporter gunned down Steve skull eastern tried to kill a bunch of Republican congressman\nOn that baseball feel this is what so dangerous about the get in your face strategy and this is what is one of the shameful aspects of the way the Democrats have been behaving through this whole judge Kavanaugh process through the political\nBattles that we're fighting with Maxine Waters and Iraq Obama and other leading Democrats encourage people to fight and get into one another's faces and\nScream and yell and corner people on elevators and chase them out of restaurants there is a dangerous dangerous aspect\nTo that if you're responsible and it is reckless thumbs and it it really is is is vile for the Democrats to be playing this game it's really really dangerous for the Democrats to be to be going down this path and I know passions\nAre high and people are mad and and Americans are are frustrated and I'm hoping and praying that that frustration and that anger and that rage\nIs going to be is going to absolutely translate to a red wave on November sick I really feel I I don't know what's gonna happen\nOr Mitch McConnell is on the floor of the Senate We're gonna play some audio just like we did yesterday the Senate majority leader is on fire people who are have been sort of subdued like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell they are unleashing\nRight now on the travesty that's taking place in America is sham of FBI investigation you don't want to know what I wanted to share this was all orchestrated by Chris Coons and Jeff Flake\nAnd we need Jeff Flake devote yeah showed judge Kavanaugh we need shoes in college to vote yes we need Lisa Murkowski to vote yes we need capital how to get confirmed there has been no core operation\nTo these accusations end of these allegations and we'll see what the\nFBI concludes and it could come today the finish line is in sight there are reports that the FBI could wrap up the capital investigation by today about of course isn't going to be sufficient for the Democrats because they're going to play on gay and they've been playing a game\nHere's an example of the game but we're we're the clip right with savannah Guthrie and Chris Coons\nDon't have the number here in front of me I Want you go that's a clip number ... this was from the from the today show on NBC this morning and I have to hand it to savannah Guthrie she called out the Democrats\nCharade either very powerful way\nOf these guys are joined that they have now they're like the the the the\nLewis and Martin Act of twenty eight teams are going around look at a ... were nonpartisan you know look reached across the aisle we got to make the world a better place to buy a I'd like\nTo build the world to give the world a coke imperfect ... you know but ... shouldn't watch savannah Guthrie\nExposed with Chris Coons and the fallacy of the Democrats wanting an FBI investigation sevens background check show that they can just decide whether or not Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court\nAren't getting ... getting into ladder than an Eighteen year old or Seventeen year old Ken wrote about his ... [noise] you know give me a break and they've I think what it that's really what we're getting into into really fair if it really relevant to me I Can't wait for find class\n[noise] savannah when Dr foreign came forward um with President Trump to spark described as a credible and compelling testimony ah\nThought and uh my friend Jeff I thought that that deserves a brief a weeklong further investigation to show the victims of sexual assault in this country that we take that seriously and it's worth investigating I Do think whether or not\nShe testified truthfully to the committee is a question before us found the FBI isn't going to reach conclusions they are going to deliver facts from further questioning and that way the Senate are going to have to make an ultimate decision I Am I'm a Democrat I think it was important we work together to accomplish that yeah\nDefinitely I mean in in ... senator 'cause they were already going to vote against hatch cabin on anyway and he voted against [noise] SAT scores that as well so I'm sure some people might be sitting there going well wait a minute and things like what's wrong with the process of ... along partisan lines [noise]\nThree

at a at\nJoe welcome to the Mike out her show how are you my friend [noise]\nLike I'm doing just fine thanks good good I Want to dive into the the reason he wrote the book obviously social media is such an important\nPart of so many people's lives and yet there's there are real perils to being kind of trapped in that social media bubble or that\nYeah boy aren't there um [noise] you know we live and hyper connected world and we seem to be less connected to each other and then ever before and so that's the kind of thing I always wanted to address as to what it is\nWhat makes us the kind of people we become right there where you know we find 'em justice lack of civility and I've been concerned about this for years about that the climate in our personal and corporate civility you know and this this connectedness between families and friends so\nWriting the book was my attempt to address those issues and maybe offer some some really good thoughts and how we might get past that and analyze why we've gotten this far and things like that so who it was fun to do\nWell and I think the reason I was drawn to your message and why I like the book so much the biggest takeaway for me\nIs is abandoned me on the anonymity of the Internet and and and connecting with people face to face I mean it's been tough for me over the decades that I've done this for a living at least even with a caller that I talk to on this show where there's a name and there's a person and there's a voice\nIt's not really an anonymous and yet social media has elevated anonymity to new heights and\nI fear in Bolden was really really awful awful online behavior Joe\nNo I don't think there's any doubt that I think we all see that and that's the problem with that entity that fosters cowardice I think at times and I think it enables us to have a less than best [laughter] of our\nNature come out where we can say what we want to say um any kind of vitriol that we want to throw out there and have no accountability so part of the problem is accountability right\nUh when I face to face with you I I'm less likely to be that kind of person that if I were disconnected hiding behind this fire wall of them personality as I call it so accountability is an important thing\nUm and I think the problem with the anonymity of the Internet is that we only become truly him and when we intersect with each other when I see in your eyes your soul when I hear\nYour heartbeat when I hear the ... ... your dream I then become more connected with you and I am less likely to be um [noise] against to when I find out that we are\nReally more alike than we seem to be and so those are the kinds of things I think anonymity breeds on the Internet and leave the elevator that\nAn art form this ugliness and uh the problem is that many of our young people have a bigger relationship with their cell phones and with a friend\nAnd that just continues to compound the problem because we're leaning ladder against or wrong law to get to trick community and that's what I Try to deal with and the book\nJob attack Israel 'cause she wrote an friended finding proof community in a disconnected culture because you can get it at Amazon and we have a link posted it might go online dot com or\nTo make it easy for you to order this very very important book Joe what do you believe the takeaways are um in in this new world we're in and this this disconnected culture what should people be doing what should we take to try to to try to break this pattern\nI think first of all and what I tried it mentioned in the book is um [noise] what would you take a step back you know when I'm treasury agents are taught to on no counterfeit is sure\nThey do look for counterfeit they just get to know what the real thing looks like so well that the counterfeit it's so obvious [laughter] I think because many people live in a counterfeit culture\nThey haven't seen the real thing so our job is to help the looming the real thing to them that will find\nA in their hearts something that says boy that so much better than what I'm doing now and so part of the issue is trying to help people understand what is the genius of what true community is about and the genius of our country which has found it on the knowledge that\nWe find that our motto which as one for many people are but soon them right written on all of our bills in coins and the reality of it that is when we understand that\nThe diversity that God has planned in the world all that's much better than just saying that scene uniformity and so understanding that we are stronger when we respect our differences we are stronger when we engage with each other to find out what we're really like\nAnd so that it's important that we have that can go back to engaging with each other\nBecause animals will sense what we're about and so that's important and then not understanding that we're only strong when we stand together regardless of whether we believe in what we um each other's opinions and\nAnd I'm a ideas and things because it's important that we hear each other and so I like and that to um the redwood forest where um these tall trees we

that I'm grateful to USA Today [noise]\nFor reminding me why we fight [noise] not often that I can look at the front page of USA Today [noise] and be delivered a message that says every single one of us better be off our butts and voted on November the six here's the headline above the fold confirmation won't end\nKavanaugh fight if the Democrats gain power they could try impeachment says USA Today the battle over judge Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd his nomination to the Supreme Court is unlikely to end with this confirmation vote says this article Democrats said they won't let go of the sexual assault\nAllegations against Kavanaugh or accusations he lied about them and other issues before the Senate Judiciary committee even if he is elevated to the high court if they win control of one or both houses of Congress in November there will be in a position\nTo continue the fight you need any more motivation do you need anything else wow what a time we're living in\nA one a dark dark cloud hovers over this great country of ours and we are perhaps a few days away from this historic vote and we're going to see if the smear\nWorked or not\nYou know you probably hearing the news accounts of ah how a friend of Christine Blasey Ford rather an ex boyfriend I should say\nGave Senate investigators are sworn statement saying he witnessed her coach a friend on how to take a polygraph\nWhich contradicts her sworn testimony from last week a man who claims to be an ex boyfriend Christine Blasey Ford says he has personally witnessed Ford coaching her friend the troubling allegation was revealed in a letter from Senator Chuck Grassley yesterday\nTo attorneys for Dr Christine Blasey Ford now there is an update on this now that friend who was allegedly coached by the ex boyfriend has issued a statement her name is Monica McLean she's a retired FBI agent\nAnd friend to forge she issued this statement to news outlets\nI have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at any time now this modern but Monica McLean is evidently the person that the ex boyfriend was referencing the and his sworn statement show\nIf anything this once again confirms\nThe downside of allegations flying around that can't be corroborate in this case it's been refuted pretty pretty quickly\nWithin a day but\nThere's doubt because of course the the ex boyfriends submitted a sworn statement and the statement from Monica McClain who was said to be the woman coached by Dr Ford that's presumably not a sworn David is just a press release or a statement to\nThe media how do you know ... how do you know about any of this stuff I didn't know what happened thirty six years ago\nWhen somebody makes an accusation that may or may not believe believe last night the president went on the offensive in Mississippi I've met kind of wish they wouldn't have said it ...\nOr what but he said it and at the end of the day\nHe fights he's fighting hard for his nominee\nI Believe we are playing to an audience of just a few senators all I care about is getting judge Kavanaugh confirmed and yes that means playing the game a little bit and having to be a diplomatic\n[laughter] it for the lack of a better word with people like Jeff Flake I don't know where Jeff Flake is going to be on this I don't I just cannot get a read on it um I who know how do we know how many of them are going to vote\nWe don't know we don't know\nUh I watched very intently and interview that Senator Flake and senator Coons gave this morning on the today show\nAnd of course there I keep saying there the new Lewis and Clark and somebody in the chat room it Mike online dot com some smart alec said Mike is revealing his age by his Lewis and Martin reference ... that set in my as before my time\nI don't remember Lewis and and and uh and Martin\nGive me a better duo who's a who's a who's a pair
