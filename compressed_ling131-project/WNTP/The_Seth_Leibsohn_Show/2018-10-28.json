invasion\nYes sir\nWell ... given the fact that we've had so far this year I think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across and ah\nThis I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system is basically an attempt to raise the border and say that um we have to let anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that in the lawyer who say\nThat so [noise] but when you say ... and a planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUh I think it's just a part of the the war or the battle between conservatives\nAnd left us that are trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\nExcept if

thing to basically make a stand and just say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras is to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now [noise]\n[noise] and to bring them back

deal and if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from a China or Russia and I mean\nWhy does that have to do what is out to do with this guy can kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow um Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince of Saudi Arabia [noise] got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he ... obviously President Trump has never hold on anyone to kill reporters\nA and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte in one of the worst moments of his life losing his temper and slam slamming doing a body
