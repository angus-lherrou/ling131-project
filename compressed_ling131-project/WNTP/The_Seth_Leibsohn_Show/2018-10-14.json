nine Ninety dot com [noise]\nHorses Michael ... mature American citizen [noise]\nAnd a Mac is making a a very very profound case but I think you need to pay attention to it\nIf you are an American senior if you're fifty year old or you're eligible to join a Mac and you're also somebody who's going to be very concerned about Medicare because you either depend upon Medicare now where are you going to depend on it is a factor in our lives Medicare is under\nProfound assault no not all Republicans we're trying to save Medicare is by Democrat\nThat's Seventy members of the house who signed on for that Bernie Sanders idea of Medicare for all the Medicare for all means as Medicare for none because the system cannot function there's not enough money in it and can't even pay the bills right now it needs to be fixed\nBut Medicare for all means that all of a sudden you triple the number of people who are on Medicare and how do you pay for that\nWhat happens is the people who currently are depending on Medicare who spent their whole careers in lives paying into the Medicare system because they have that Medicare tax on your paycheck every single month\nThose people get cheated\nAnd yes it is a question of cheating goes to a Mac to us that is a Mac dot us a test or take the uh a Mac pledge or go even better too don't touch my Medicare dot com right now that don't touch my Medicare dot com\nThat when you compare that to the Democrats were and banning straws Jerry Brown said if you use plastic straws in our state you're going to jail\nThen when you think about who ... possibly the speaker of the host of the Democrats win said just somebody here legally doesn't mean they're broke any laws this is staggering her logic she says we should only deporting illegals ... if they do something illegal I mean\nThere are a lot of Democrats or they don't want to deport them even if they've committed murder\nBut I made her logic building a wall with all the rights of millions of illegals what about the rights of Americans\nRight do you allow all seven billion people in the world coming to Texas Arizona and New Mexico and California I mean do you go out everybody in the world I mean if you're not going\nTo have a wall why wouldn't every person and every country in the world all come in they get better welfare benefits here than in Chile or Argentina\nBotswana or somewhere else I mean right I mean if there are no rules and laws and the walls and no immigration process then in fact you're allowing everybody to come in\nRight and what we've seen is that is beginning to happen so it would just continue to increase which makes me wonder do you think the Democratic party will survive in the future because they're the ones with all these left wing ideas\nThe answer is now I don't they have gone beyond the pale I think they've gone beyond what the American people are willing to put up with and in the history of the United states back all the way to Seventy and eighty nine parties did not stay forever some staying longer stumps shorter but a lot of parties don't make it forever the way\nParty was very successful for about fifty years they went out of business literally any party that doesn't fulfill the will of the people the people the voters\nDon't vote for them they go out of business I think the Democratic party is on its way out of business it may be held up for a little while because there are some rich a couple of rich billionaires that are helping to prop 'em up but I don't think they're going to be able to survive without votes I think they're going to be out of\nBusiness in the Democratic party than just because of the Democratic socialist party or just change her name\nI think they won't even change the name I think I got shut down completely I think another party will take its place and I think the party will be something like the Republican progress I think the Republican Party is going to split one side of the conservative the other side as progressive Republicans the Democrats\nWho are a little bit more enlightened not so radical they'll joined the Republican progressive conservative Republicans will become the conservative I think that will be a name change but I think the people in the establishment Republican rhinos will form a new party the Democratic party I think will shut down\nWell that's pretty profound because you wrote in your book the Democratic party will never elect another president and the reason is is because the Democratic party is not the party of John F. Kennedy the Democratic party has been co opted by socialist maybe communist\nThe Democratic party will never run another candidate for president\nUs pretty sound so you're saying and twenty twenty\nI'm saying they could shut down as early as next year after the devastating losses they have in twenty eight\nNew rules are predicted trouble when the electoral college in twenty twenty by three hundred and fifty electoral votes and growing right now\nThat's amazing well and also the heartland they're all for Trump is just he's he's on the coast that are for left wing Democrat\nRight and that's why the Democrats I think are working so hard on getting the border open because they believe a lot of people who can't speak English are uneducated are basically just candidates for welfare and they'll be able to be told the vote for Democrats plan is how they keep getting elected office at all\nThat's why the Democrats wants to open borders desperate attempt to gain more voters because they know the people here are pretty much was to their idea because illegal immigration is not a simple right any more than breaking into somebody's house makes the robber a member of the family\nThat's a good way to put a good way to put it and by the way you see some sanctuary cities around the country are trying to say that they're going to allow illegal immigrants to vote have you seen that in\nThe cities yeah will kill the phony allows them to get driver's licenses\nAnd they should and they certainly shouldn't be allowed to vote and by the way if you also eliminated all those folks who are voting illegally right now\nI think you'd find the Democrats losing even worse there quite a few voters in there that are not truly legal voters the people who have died some of that has been documented by different researchers I think it's most unfortunate I think we need a voter id law to protect the integrity of all of our election\nI Do too well my concern was that will be a lot of Democrats that will go out to vote against Trump but then\nWe don't want Republicans become complacent because if we think he's gonna win and I mean the house is going to be all Republican in the Senate so we want to encourage people that they don't need to go out and vote\nState voter intensity for Republicans a strong going into the twenty Eighteen election because they know what's going on they understand the Democrats want to impeach Trump they don't want Trump impeached so they're feeling very strong to vote on the other side the radicals in the left is they're not\nAs strong because they don't see anything in it for themselves\nAnd the idea of teaching Trump they don't see any immediate benefit to them\nI mean the welfare check isn't going to go up if Trump or to be impeached if anything the economy's going to go down and I think they know it they know that he's done a whole lot better than Obama so I think the voter intent saying democratic side is pretty low and on the Republican side is still pretty high\nThat's why I expect us to be an unusual off year election a lot more Republicans elected then would normally be elected because following a new president usually the party in power in the White House\nLoses a lot of seats but I don't think that's going to happen\nDonald Trump has been the only conservative in decades it actually fought for conservative principles who wasn't above the fray who wasn't intimidated by the media were buddy opposition he's a tough fight or he's not going to like pass conservatives\nHe's not ruled by the approval polls are punt is when you think about what he did with Syria's chemical weapons against their own people fifty nine Tomahawk missiles hit their base and said a clear message to the world the Trump\nWill use military force also the strongholds have been really neutralized to North Korea has been diminished and even contained\nRight here is a personal axon principles that he believes and he just has an intuition about what's right what's wrong he also does not get intimidated by anybody\nAnd he follows that pattern that the electorate was looking for in twenty sixteen I called the general Patton Trent have and they were looking for somebody tough they didn't want somebody who would be walked all over by the media and boy did they catch that right\nIn the past history United States nine military leaders went on to become president so they were looking for somebody like a general or military leader or somebody who is rock solid like general Patton they found that in Trump and Trump is pretty tough yeah doesn't get pushed around by anybody\nAnything outside or he's not part in the Washington DC inner circle and he is ... and I also believe that God raise them up for such a time is that God gave us a divine ... fried and it's like Cyrus and the Bible and there was so much prayer to\nAbsolutely and this is a country that's based on Christian principles and Christians a lot of the universities and colleges around the country there are gender was in different Christian denominations it's really a shame to see them losing a lot of those principles\nBut I think that the trend is toward regaining the principles they've lost and that's part of this new conservative era that we've moved into\nWell with the conservatives senators Trump has had to U.S Supreme court justices confirmed and he's got two more to go with a couple of the Supreme Court justice is going to retire or die in office\nRight I think that in his first term he will point for constitutional conservatives he may get a fifth on a sex in his second term it's going to be a rock solid conservative super majority\nOf the Supreme Court which is going to have a profound impact in a lot of areas of American Life for the better\nThat's encouraging because I Do think we could ever get real v Wade reverse\nI think it will be reverse hallelujah because it's not based in constitutional principles there is no right to privacy in the constitution it was a made up right and in fact\nYou think about the ramifications of this so called right to privacy there's no boundaries on at for example you could say a right to privacy means that prostitution is totally legal why not have prostitution everywhere why not\nHave other strange things legalized marriage or anything and you just say oh that's the right to privacy well what what is in private I mean you can think of anything and say it's private\nDid they reverse same sex marriage yes\nWhat about getting the Bible duck and public schools that\nCould be right to privacy to\nMammoth back in the public school\nWhen you basically make up the constitution as you go you can put anything in there you want and that's kind of what the basis of the radical left is they want to basically have laws is what they want not what's good for the country not what's moral not what's at all not even what's legal and\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a planet and they caught flat and cover more with lower co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to the the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare system it's free thanks my this is Michael met that for health markets\nFind

that has really dominated the headlines over the last few weeks the grand jury report on sexual abuse child sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church\nThis has hit the legislature in terms of a proposal to open perhaps a a two year window to allow victims the opportunity to go back and sue tell us a little bit about what the discussion centered on and what did the house\nTo do in response to this issue looming the the house of representatives passed Senate bill to sixty one with an amendment that would provide for that to your look back to send it to the original version did not have that look back in it of the bill extend to statute of limitation basically up to age fifty now\nWhich I think is a really good thing this abuse\nOr is something that is absolutely a tolerable no matter how you look at it and this entire idea of providing a protections how do people ever abused young children is just absolutely on anyone who says absolute unrealistic\nThat being said the version I left the house also a script out the portions of the bill that included government so basically government now has sovereign immunity and limited exposure\nOr for those children who might be abused and say the public school system or something that nature which I find absolutely morally repugnant\nThat we would protect one set of pedophiles but not go after other since so it's it's really a sad commentary we need to fix this and start protecting those individuals and that's kind of what the center of the debate really focused on\nSo you're saying that the bill declared the house exams school districts the state legislature any other type of government\nAny government governmental entity has a limited immunity and basically they're any suit me would be of a criminal nature with some very limited civil actions were as any other lawsuits brought by children or their parents or buy a child in say a Catholic school or\nAny other type of school system or any not for profit\nWould have an

your listeners to get a copy of that report and that report gives extraordinary amount of details of the over sixteen hundred active cases currently being pursued in the public school systems in our
