{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "\nLet me tell you something initially President Trump talked about terrorists in order for uh for national security remember that never mind that we produce most of our steel here and the two other major suppliers Canada and Mexico are friendly countries so the national security stuff with the U.S and you know she stopped saying that\nNow if the goal is to reduce tariffs with our trading partners I'm all for and the short run doing something to make them stand out the question is is this going to benefit the American consumer and it's too early to tell that\nThe New York times called it a victory for the president and it is the ... did as well and it is because the campaign to reevaluate their to renegotiate NAFTA the question is is it going to be positive for the American consumers for example [noise]\nNew York times points out that for the first time the new agreement mandates that an increasing percentage of parts for any tariff free vehicle must come from so called high wage factory\nThe agreement says they'll sacrifice pay a minimum sixteen dollars an hour in average salaries for production workers that's about triple the average wage in Mexico right now and the assumption is that division will force automakers to strip suppliers from Mexico or Canada to this country\n[noise] but there is to that\nAutomotive Alice had warned that the provision could have a damaging effect for Americans quote by raising costs for American car buyers and incentivizing automakers to move production to low cost countries outside of the country like China so we don't we don't know yet\nAnd I want to find out more about it before I determine whether or not the president has done the right thing with NAFTA and know what's popular among the base especially and now that Bernie Sanders has become a anti free trade and um the Republican Party also anti free trade are both parties now have pretty much the same position on trade\nOne more time this is about consumers and tariffs\nIf they are designed to protect industries that are that are failing all they do is prevent the business people from doing the kinds of things that need to do in order to make those businesses competitive\nAnd if the idea is to retaliate against or the or the country for so called dumping products on us dumping simply means of other companies are are being subsidized by their government\nThey're not making money but they are being subsidized by government and it and if that stupid why should we would retaliate by doing something equally stupid I still feel exactly the same if however the ... is to cause our trading partners to reduce their tariffs on our goods\nOpening up\nTheir market for our manufacturers and suppliers that's good but if if the result in higher prices to the American consumer explained to me how that's a good idea\nSo it's too early to a a do a victory lap as far as I'm concerned I Want to find out more about it anyway thank you very much for ah for the call appreciate it triple eight nine seven one S.

any war the ... and he was told by\n\nI I Want this week over in the worst way\nAnd it's only Monday week is just beginning\nAnd everybody's about no fly they know what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh everybody\nI'll tell you what this issue I don't like to listen to either side on this issue I don't want to listen to either side I just want you know what I Want the FBI just to do their stuff I Want the FBI to be done in two to three to four days and I want to vote on the floor of the United States Senate on friday I Want this done\n\nI Wish I could tell you what the FBI is doing right now found out a couple of hours ago that there are still interviewing mark judge allegedly the guy that was in the room and thirty five years ago who knows\n\nThe White House is all over the map on this Senate Republicans are all over the map on this Senate Democrats are ridiculous they put a list of about twenty four people that they are insisting the FBI interview\nI don't care what the Democrats say here they're done as far as I'm concerned for Democrats stopped speaking last week they got their wish\nThey got their bone baby they got there asked the investigation now as far as I'm concerned the Democrats need to just shut up and let the FBI do the work I Wish it was well the Republicans would shut up to\nI Wish everybody would\n\nBut we can't you go on Facebook you go on Twitter everybody knows everything\nEverybody for sure knows everything\nDr Blasey Ford is a Democrat to she's the fake she's a liar\nOr see as heroin Brett Kavanaugh does not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nOr he is mean pilloried in screwed like known nominees and the Supreme Court has ever done and Ben and Ben's subjected to before\nThe ... we've we've we've drawn lines right we've decided where we stand on Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd where we stand today is the FBI is doing their work they began\nA speaking to people over the weekend when the order came down on friday afternoon for the FBI to investigate the FBI began investigating friday afternoon that's how the FBI does things\nAnd that's what they're doing\nAnd there is confusion about again the scope\n\nMember of the uh the order on friday was current incredible allegations well is that is that a\nIs that just Dr Ford is that Dr Ford and and ah this woman named ... list is that Dr Ford Gonzales and this woman named sweat Nick and again I got to be honest President Trump's all over the map on this man he let it ripped today\nHe announced his new NAFTA it's pretty much pretty damn close to the old NAFTA will get into that later but he was asked a bunch of questions at a press conference about Kavanaugh\nSandy set a lot of what he's already said about Brett Kavanaugh\n\nBut I'll tell you why I I think I can say this word on the radio diarrhea can I say that Devon diarrhea\nI think I can say diary on the radio Donald Trump sometimes he just can't help himself he's got a little diarrhea their mouth and and he just he he talked about how may be Brett Kavanaugh you know poor guy maybe in high school and college he didn't drink too much\nAh he talked about maybe that oh sure go ahead and look at us or the ... the third woman and her allegations Trump was all over the map today talking about Brett Kavanaugh I don't think that's helpful\n\nThis FBI investigation should be limited\nPeriod\nThan it should last this week and not one day more Mitch McConnell Senate mine a majority leader Mitch McConnell\nThe floor of the Senate today said we're voting I'm Brett Kavanaugh of this week\nHe'd better they'd better\n[noise] but see you're not going to know when we're not going to know I and I hope you understand how this works the FBI is actively interviewing people right now and there was confusion nowaday interviewing Brett Kavanaugh we don't know are they interviewing doctor for we don't know\n\nThe FBI's got to determine within their within their scope within what their broad mandate is who they are going to interview with him that\nAnd then it's up to them\nAnd the Republicans and Democrats don't have to know and shouldn't know when you and I should know\n\nBut I get really tired of every body\nBree tending their the expert on this topic like a Rachel Mitchell she was the prosecutor\nRemember the woman from Arizona who ask the questions of Dr Ford\nAnd a Brett Kavanaugh during the hearing on Thursday well she asked Dr Ford questions and then she started to ask a Brett Kavanaugh questions and Lindsey Graham and the rest of the Republicans in the Senate did really wandering asking any more questions so they started to do their\nOwn talking But Rachel Mitchell over the weekend\nPut out a five page memo\nHer report\nUm that she gave to the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee five page report and we'll get into this too but she makes clear\nThis isn't even a he said she said\nA Rachel Mitchell who's the prosecutor said there's no way I Would have prosecuted this case\nThis is not even a he said she said this is weaker than a he said she said\n\nCan right away the Republicans and end all conservatives on Facebook and Twitter jumped on that she\n\nWell Rachel Michel ... looked at that that was a report that she gave me the Republicans\nShe didn't she didn't interview a Brett Kavanaugh there are a lot of problems with that that will get into but everybody sees what they want to see\nAnd\nHere's how I'm going to handle this week\n'cause I can guarantee you this will be the biggest story of the week again until this Brett Kavanaugh mess is put to bed this is gonna be the biggest political story in the country\nAnd I'm going to kind of handle it like I handled the Russia investigation okay I'm going to wait I Want this thing over all I Want is for this thing to be over\nI'm no longer listening to what any Republican or Democrat Senator has to say it's all this is a political football now\nI'm not listening to any a conservative on Twitter or Facebook or any liberal on Twitter or Facebook everybody has picked their side\nAnd there were only reading about and following things that add bands what they believe in\nI eat I Believe Cavanaugh I don't believe forward or I Believe for I don't believe cabinet and even this for a report that the prosecutor Rachel Mitchell poured out Republicans are holding this up like this proves Brett Kavanaugh's innocence Democrats are saying no wait a minute\nWait a minute that's a political document too\nSo I'm just going to keep my nose out of all of it I Want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed and by the way I think\nThis is advice that you all we all would be well advised\nTo take I Want Kavanaugh confirmed I Want that vote to happen by the end of the week\n\nI Believe most everything of what I hear this week is going to be a bunch of garbage on both sides because both sides are kind of positioning themselves for this vote and Democrats do want to delay this thing they want to continue to the latest thing beyond the weight that ain't happening\n\nI'm not I'm not paying attention to any of that and I'm not going to weigh in on what the FBI is doing I'm going to let the FBI do their job\n[noise]\nGive their report to the White House [noise] and then vote on this man who has been through\nBack I'm sure we're also going [noise]\n\nIs just so disappointing um I I I think we're going to do this I think it's going to go through this week but I don't think having a ... it's going to be confirmed everybody had made their mind up already this is all just a big\nShow and such but I I completely agree with you I'm staying out of it I'm not doing it in this week but it's going to be so bad because I really believe he's not going to get in on\nAnd it's just a shame and I I watched what our senator from Illinois I get to that man yeah and and I want to move out of the state I'm so disgusted by Senator Durbin and ... ... it was appalling appalling what he did\nAnd you have any I agree don't move out of Illinois because the Durban do move out of Illinois because of the taxes that so much better reason look don't I I I agree with that do everybody um don't let this week the last week there's nothing more\nThat we can do and as far as the Democrats go guys\nThey don't matter here\nPlease know that I Want to say this again\nThe FBI's gotta week this week\nAnd they're going to come back and it's gonna we're either going to be where we were at the end of last week they're just going to confirm what the Senate told us or there might be something new\nAnd if we're where we are at the end of last week all the Republicans are going to vote for cap and all we do not need a Democrat vote\nThe Democrats\nNo longer matter in this process if the FBI just confirms what we know we don't need them if the FBI finds out that Brett Kavanaugh has been lion as I said\nAnd I hope and pray\nThat that's not going to be the case but if we find out he's been line he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court anyway the Democrats don't matter I'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere [noise]\n[noise] it's time to check the malls freedom voicemail when you're saying about

agree with your advice about getting on with your life but I thought you were advice last week and I knew this was coming 'cause you know the Democrats and the socialists they all [noise] broadcasters their their intentions are and\nYeah I cook your advice and good advice get on with your life\nDon't want to get it get you down and just\nPray for the best that this man gets confirmed\nWe get on with the country's business\nYeah Roger will said man well said my friend most everybody that I read over the weekend\nBelieved\nThat you know you know the FBI does all the FBI does is they interview everybody the ... and again they interview people like a lot of people can't interview people I I knowledge that but they're going to interview everybody and they're going to file a little report and they're going to give it to the White House they're not going to draw any conclusions\nThere I can say we think Brett Kavanaugh's line we think he's guilty we think that Dr Christine Ford made up the whole thing that's not what the FBI does they're going to say here's a report here's what Dr Ford said\nIt was not the American flag not even close just a big black or read and then a white stripe in the middle and then a blue stripes and there were some white stars nobody knew what it was\nThe uh the commentary on social media was hilarious the color commentator I guess on TV said I don't know what flag that is I don't know what country that comes from but I'm not I'm not I'm not putting my hand over my heart for that flag that's not the American flag it wasn't the American flag\nAbsolutely crazy the Green Bay Packers issued a statement today that said the banner used during Sundays pregame ceremony supplemented the three us flags on the roof of the stadium and the flag carried by the color guard on the field\nWe've used such displays from time to time in the past\nWhen other pre game elements take up a significant portion of the field the Green Bay Packers announced they will never ever ever use that flag again because the Green Bay Packers caught so much grief rightly and they should have\nAnd I guess there was like massive confusion that limbo feel nobody in the joint knew what this what this flag was people were trying to figure out what country this flag comes from cut it out I'm not just talking to the Packers now I'm Talking to everybody\nIf you're gonna if you're going to have a flag has a big banner on your field during pre game ceremonies he'd had better be the American flag I'm so damned\nTired off I'm so tired of of people so many interest in this country reflect simply\nBe like being in barest to be proud to be American it's like it's like I guarantee you the Packers didn't want to offend anybody by using the real the actual American flag what what were they thinking\nIt would be like I mean can you imagine an NFL game pregame ceremony and they uh they they unfurled Mexican flag or the French flag they'd be run out of town or they should have been run out of town Green Bay should have\nFor what they did yesterday just crazy check it out it it it is a flag that is on recognizable let me go to Jim\nYou're on the show Hey Joe I agree completely with what your uh opening monologue was a there is nothing we can do about this just sit back for friday my only concern is that uh we still have left this deep state uh it hasn't been completely purged from the ranks and rank and file\nA more by the rank and file I think are good but I don't know about the hierarchy of the upper echelon and my concern is that something might be called like they did a ... with General Michael Flynn where the uh FBI findings were correct\nBut then they were a mess represented to the public and he was hard to drive for something he didn't do\nA yeah let me ask you a question Jim you and I probably disagree on how extensive the deep state is Christopher Wray who now runs the FBI he's Trump's guy Trump picked Christopher Wray or do you trust Christopher Wray\nAt this point I don't know who to trust frankly ... he's the unknown to me uh I it's just a show me just say yes let's run out and we'll are judging by his actions\nGym that's actually probably a pretty good attitude look this is this is again why this is such a dangerous topic to talk about ... and you hear people on conservative talk radio and Fox News tell you\nThat the other witnesses that we're supposed to be at the party refuted what Dr Ford said in fact\nBrett Kavanaugh said under oath that the other witnesses refuted what Dr Ford said\nThat's not true every single witness has said I don't recall the party I don't remember that party I don't remember being there\nNow they may not be able to cooperate or story but none of them have refuted that none of them have said that party didn't happen\nNone of the witnesses said that all they've said is thirty five years ago I don't remember that party\nThere is a big big difference isn't there between saying I don't recall the party and the party never happened no no witnesses refuted what she said there is no cooperation yet and maybe there never will be but you gotta be careful this is\n[noise] you

I I guess here's my my my issue [laughter]\nPresident Trump is called NAFTA the worst deal and the worst deal in history\nSee if you can follow this one so President Trump has called NAFTA the worst deal ever made in history show today what President Trump did was he made a few teeny little tweaks to NAFTA changed its name\nAnd he called this the best deal in history and John gene by what a lot of people are saying and conservative media and this is the greatest deal in the world when really all Donald Trump did was make minor tweaks to NAFTA\nTrade agreement by the way that has needed up dating for a long long time in before we get into the deal that Trump announced today\nAnd this is the bigger issue with me so many people have stopped thinking I saw this happen with Obama whatever Brock Obama said people just from then failed to their knees and borrowed and said you're the greatest my leader\nA leader leader lead me guide me you are the best\nPeople stopped thinking anything Obama said they believed they bought hook line and sinker and I criticize that you criticized that I made fun of that you made fun of that these past eight years when Obama was president\nAnything and everything he said his his supporters bought\nIt makes me sad because there are too many people on our side doing the same damn thing\nDoing the same damn thing Trump comes out today and he says I just signed the greatest deal in history\nAnd a lot of people by it and believe it\nWithout even knowing what he did\nTrump comes out and said that and all of his supporters may get down on their knees and they bought when they swing without even understanding what Trump did today\nHe took an agreement that has needed updating for a while right an agreement that Trump has said is the worst deal and history and all he did was kind of maybe short a little bit ... I I mean he didn't even change it he tweaked it a little bit so how do you get\nAfter a couple minor tweaks and you change the name how do you get from the worst deal in history to the best deal in history\nHow do you do that\nSee the problem is though Trump can say that at a press conference and all of the crowd that go you're the greatest oh my leader\nOr a few minor changes automobiles and by the way automobiles what Trump signed today is going to make it more expensive to make automobiles here\nWho get into that later but in order to qualify for zero terrorists auto autos will have to have more of the manufacturing done by high paid workers a little tweak dairy Canada is going to have to accept a little bit more of American milk and dairy products\nCopyright candidate will extend the term of the copyright part of NAFTA or from fifty years all the way up to Seventy years\nDispute resolution\nOr there's a provision and after that allows investors to challenge the decisions made by the government's ... as part of these trade agreements um ... those are disputes will be resolved by a panel\nOf a members from the three countries Mexico the United states and Canada and then a new name\nTrump just gave it a new name what is it called now it's now called the helped me helped me helped me I'm going to find it it's now called the instead of NAFTA it's now the\nOh come on\nIt's now the uh the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nOr who's ... so he changed his name couple minor tweaks to NAFTA\nSo I ... and the name change and this is the greatest deal in history by the way if you liked NAFTA\nWell I guess you'll be okay with this new trade deal because it's pretty much NAFTA if you didn't like NAFTA if you thought NAFTA was a bad thing well then you're not going to like Trump's new trade agreement\nBecause it's just a little bit worse than NAFTA and oh by the way a none of this will go into effect if it does go into effect until twenty twenty because Congress has to approve this in Congress by the way the legislative the legislatures and all three countries have to prove these minor tweaks\nCongress won't even look at this till next year\n\nI just worry so much that we have people who\nFall in love with an door\nWorship politicians be they Reagan Bush or Obama or Trump and they just stop thinking\nI'd be willing to wager and in fact I Will wager most everybody listening to me right now has no idea\nUh\nHow Trump today changed NAFTA\nBut you may be saw the headlines that Trump Trump make some ... ... makes a big deal Trump signs new trade deal with Canada and Mexico\nBest deal ever many of you probably have seen a headline like that and you don't know at all what was done today I I Would advise you and suggest that you do look into it\nBecause it's pretty much left to let me go to my friend Sean taken away but\nJoe it's even worse than that because what when this bill within this bill is a guarantee in an agreement that the foreign labor will cost more exact so for all the propaganda of it helping the American worker it's trying to\nPat the American worker by making the value go away from saving on labor in foreign country so it's an extremely pro union bill not only that it adds a tremendous layer of bureaucracy because some Iran with a calculator in his pocket protector\nEthic calculate what side of the car is made by American companies doing business in America but hey Sean eating the irony\nYeah yeah yeah shiny and then I'll let you have the final word just so everybody knows so this was one of Trump's minor tweaks instead of sixty two percent of the parts in that car\nHave to be made in North America now maybe Seventy five percent might be have to be made in North America which is stupid to begin with go ahead Shawn\n... here's here's where he sets it up beautifully to fail and then blame the foreigner\nBecause what he does as you said something very important the other Congress is half to agreed with the president still write laws we just we we are relinquish the power now right and we love the president like a dictator so all three countries have to have the Congress agreed to it but what do you think the American\nMoney is going to do in Mexico the lobby so that the Mexican Congress doesn't increase the cost of the American companies doing business yeah than its chief me it doesn't really exist behind the scenes that same American Company everybody puts threat\nI going to be crushed appeal because it's not about freedom it's about control why don't we want freedom\nShawnee thank you man you're spot I'm a I'm sure will still go anywhere [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nPerson they had and they're lying person that they had\nIn their pockets and a lot okay so this is what it comes down to you and everybody listening to your show and this is what it comes down to thirty six day regardless of what this ... thing I Do believe that President Trump is trying to get rid of their slant and trying to\nLook for a merit how Americans should be a sovereign nation\nNow when we're looking at with the plight the check yet that they've left is Dianne Feinstein and I run it when he says Dianne Feinstein says at that rupture herself ... but\nIt it it ... out the window and they set a precedent that anybody could make an allegation I don't know what ... what maybe\nThey die of love you I'm only ... yeah and I love you and I gave you a lot of time and I do love you and I'm Glad you called I just got to uh I mean I have to hop here in a second I don't want to look at all I'm asking for us

why he doesn't hold more press conferences because I think he actually does pretty good with them and I think he actually handles the media generally pretty damn well\nBut Trump said something today that you would say he said something today that I have said that I Would say even if I was in Congress or not\nHe said something today that no other elected official would say he said something today certainly that no other president would say he said something today in fact ... it's it's because of\nLike what he said today things like this that I still believe got Trump the nomination a couple of years ago because you remember all those other guys running against him to Ted Cruz's or the world they're Marco Rubio's or the world none of them the other sixteen would have ever said\nWhat I'm about to play for you by the way I Would have ever said what Donald Trump said today now that said that that's that's not always good Trump set a couple of other things today that were just damn stupid but this\nRight here ... your congressman your United States senator all these other presidential candidates they're all like politicians and they're also damn careful\nWhat they say maybe that's how come my only lasted two years because I wasn't careful but what I say Donald Trump isn't careful about what he said what he said right here is something no other Republican elected official would say a Devon he's talking about um\nI think he's answering questions about the trade deal but he turns out in the media and takes the shot at the media listen to what he said give me ... number

right again part of the media is part of the Democrat Party\nAnd he tweeted this afternoon because one of the things Trump did the day was\nAnd this is bad Trump a good Trump was calling up the media but then bad Trump was when Trump was talking about Kavanaugh Trump actually said um that is that he knows of a United States senator\nWho has a horrible drinking problem and that this United States senator has been in compromising situations frequently\nAnd then he refused to name who that United States senator is now that's a pretty horrible thing to do and this is what Trump it today he said\nCome on you're jumping on Capitol I Know United States senator man who's drunk all the time and he's always getting in self in trouble\nBut I can tell you who it is\nSo that's the president of the United states throwing out an allegation [laughter] about the United states senator without any proof for\nRevealing any name\nSo that's bad that's not good but this uh this lefty for political rights today tweets today the president of the United states just accused and unnamed senator or listen live I mean we're in we're in a W ... gun he or she was compromised frequently\nThen Trump refused to say who she was making the charge against\nThis is on chartered territory that is what Jonathan Allen set after Trump did what did he said we're in uncharted territory like this is really a bad bad thing and again I'll admit that bad Trump that's that's a pretty stinky thing to do\nBut we're in uncharted territory now because Trump did that said that now now we're in unchartered

shielded from the speech that makes you uncomfortable I don't believe any of that [noise] I never want a shutdown speech I\nI think [laughter] boy never ever ever want to go down that road I I Want people to pretty much be able to say whatever they want to say about Obama about Bush about Trump doesn't matter about Republicans about Democrats doesn't matter about Muslims about Jews Christians\nWe\nLive in the country well we live in a world\n\nThat\nHas a increasingly difficult time of dealing with free speech\n\nIt's fascinating but it's real ... there are there are formal tools starting to come to America They're already in Europe [noise]\nGovernment actions legislation [noise]\nYou know making it a crime to say certain things\n[noise]\nHate speech my God what the heck is hate speech there's just speech\nBut there is an effort in the world today and here in America\nTo try to restrict speech that people find ugly that people find vulgar that people find offensive that people find politically incorrect speech that makes people uncomfortable\n[noise]\nI I'm someone who\nBelieves in on Saturday speech I Would never\n\nTry to stop somebody from expressing his or her opinion I Would never try to shout down no matter how offensive\nSomebody's ability to speak\nAnd this is what the left does make clear this is a fundamental difference right now\nBetween those of us on the right and those of us on the left there's plenty of speech that you and I find the ... uncomfortable or offensive like when\nThese crazy people on the left say horrible things about Trump I'm horrible things about Republicans\n\nSpeech a ideas declarations that that make you and I squirm ... horrible stuff but\n\nI've never and I doubt you have ever tried to take away that crazy person on the left try to take away his freedom to say what he feels about Republicans are Trump\nWe don't do that we're not the ones on college campuses screaming that\nSome invited speaker\nWho makes people on that campus uncomfortable you and I don't do that\nThe other side does the left eyes\nThe last five six seven eight years have been full of examples of people in the last trying to shut down speech people on the left\nUm [noise]\nGetting to a point where where they try to intimidate speakers who espouse a viewpoint they don't like people on the left or in auditoriums in classrooms chanting and shouting down to the point where\nThat speaker is forced to stop\nAnd of course it's bad enough isn't it that the college university allows this kind of behavior\nThat's just terrific that's horrible they're not teaching these kids a lesson that all go ahead and do whatever you want right engage in that kind of behavior\nThat truly mature yeah that's a great lesson to teach these young kids if you're bothered by certain speech go ahead and shouted down\nRight [noise]\nPaid five five six for two fifty six hundred\nThat's what they do we don't do that and that is a fundamental difference and let's be really clear there's offensive speech\nAcross the political spectrum I I Know it's a popular these days since Trump got elected to think that all that hate us on the left there's plenty I hate to go around\n[noise] and\nThe only people saying nasty things ugly things not just on the laugh guys it's all over it's on the left and it's on the right it's all over and and sell it it's in between and and then remember let's just beyond that is\nBoth sides have their crazies there are nuts on both extremes they're bad people\nOn the far left in bed people on the far right there are racist on the far left and racist on the far right there haters on the far left in ... on the far right\n[noise]\nBut it it comes down to this word in tolerance\n[noise]\nLike you and I even if their speech we don't agree with we can tolerate it\nWill allow it\nWe will try to stop it or block it or getting away with it like a or get in a way of it like if if somebody's coming to my town and and you know some crazy or antifa or black lives matter person's coming into my town to speak [noise]\nUm I'm not going to organize a group to try to get that black lives matter antifa person shut down\nAnd if I Can't get him or her shutdown that I'm going to get twenty or thirty people were going to go to the event or going to shout him or her down you\n\nKnow if I had somebody come into my town\nFrom like antifa or black lives matter you know what I Do [noise] [noise] I wouldn't go [laughter] I just ignore it big deal out of ignore it and I suspect that's what most of you would do\nBut\nIf there's a hardcore conservatives somebody on the right more often than not come in somewhere to speak well then the people on the left\nAnd you see it vividly on college campuses but it's everywhere\nThey try to get the invitation to speak or\nTaken away get that person this invited and if they can't stop the event then they organized a big group of people to protest in riot or\nIn fact to try to shut that speaker down there not tolerant of other viewpoints you and I are\nYou and I are we don't agree with those viewpoints but we understand in a free society we must tolerate opposing viewpoint you and I understand that people on the left don't get that they really really don't understand that [noise]\n\nThey would suspend me they'd ban me in a nanosecond and I'd probably

A. G.

is left wing [noise]\nI thought it was at a sea pac convention [noise] all that and more\nNow before the for Kavanaugh hearings where for Nader accusations and Kevin responded sixty nine percent of Republicans supported Kavanaugh's nomination to the court thirty two percent of the general public supported it\nNow [noise]\nWhen Ford testify but before Kevin I'll respond to listen to this panel headed up by Clinton apple is people are watching\nThis all across the country has this began I had a a text my friends saying she looks like every woman you know to a scene and dean does uh she is just someone\nTo keep in mind this panel is before Kevin all testified but after four did\nCompletely recognizable to everybody in the country ah we we know women just like her and uh and she's certainly doesn't seem to be somebody was an agenda as she is putting herself in this very difficult position\nI it's a very hot here right now and ah the difference between the Democrats and Republicans has been very striking that her persona I think has come off as so far as highly credible\nI've examined hundreds of witnesses on the witness than she is extremely credible she's extremely detail oriented they're a little things about what she has said like the fact that she has\nTwo front doors he can't make that stuff up it is so unusual that sort of detail it makes her testimony extremely credible and also that she said I Am terrified to be here I don't want to be here but I feel that this is\nMy civic duty I I found her to be one of the most credible witness is I think I've seen\nIt in Georgia have to say it is unmistakable here how how clunky it is the transition between the Republicans on this committee to the Democrats you talked about Rachel Mitchell there who's been brought in by the Republican so that they would not have to question Dr Christine Blasey Ford or a\nBread capital when he appears 'em\nBefore us here later today [noise] um but that transition back and forth has been um bumpy if you will but what has not been bumpy as sort of the temperature in tone in that room from the woman who was answering the questions Dr Christine Blasey Ford obviously up to the American people at home to make up their own minds about the veracity of what she's\nSaying but she has been very consistent George\nAgain that's an ABC panel led by George ... after Dr Christine forward testified before Brett Kavanaugh did meanwhile on CNN Simone Sanders said this about Kevin\nWhat I don't believe that cat and I'll tell you the entire to it and yet the part that he noted about the yearbook entry but we call the young woman that ran that are run out of your ... because she was one of that\nShe didn't know that I just thought it was unbelievable I think he he he told not to buy you lied about things I don't think he needed to lie about that perhaps he thought that that he could not do any ground\nUm because he didn't want to be found a couple of anything I must I can think of that anger I understand if you have been if you believe you have not done something wrong and you at that and you angry but the way he portrays himself at the on outside of the hearing today um he looked on hands\nOn hands so based upon that reaction based upon the reaction by the ABC panel one would think that even Republicans might have gotten wobbly on Brett Kavanaugh\nContrary known for I mentioned that before the Ford Kevin hearings sixty nine percent of Republicans supported his nomination to the Supreme Court after the Ford Kavanaugh hearing the figure\nClose to Seventy five percent meanwhile forty six percent of Republicans said they will be angry as opposed to be disappointed if Kavanaugh is rejected\nNow as far as the public at large is concerned before the Fort Kavanaugh hearings as I mentioned thirty two percent of voters favorite Kavanaugh's nomination now thirty seven thirty seven percent favorite now in thirty percent opposed it now thirty seven percent of post\nSo it's appeared to sour the general public on Kavanaugh but not on Republicans Republicans have anything to again Lindsey Graham has warned that if this was the new norm watch out for your nominees guys\nThe polygraph and they didn't tell us until September twenty six and deal with this what's in front of a Republican I haven't got a guy who adamantly dies if everybody who actually knows him in a real way say this is not the guy I Know I got Dr Ford\nWho can't tell me the time in the place and we'll see what happens to be something that I I\nDon't know for some Republicans not so much to my Republican\nColleagues [laughter] if this becomes the new standards for you have an accusation for weeks and drop it right before the hearing you withhold from the committee a chance\nTo do this in a a professional timely fashion me one day publically say\nThat their goal is to lay the get the Senate back in twenty eight teams to make sure he can't fill the\nSeat they're publicly saying that I don't want to reward that kind of behavior I think we've been very fair and to my Republican colleagues if you can ignore everything in this record looking at allegation is thirty five years old\nThis uncertain time place\nDate and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans cost this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends\nIf this is the new norm [noise] you'd better watch out for your nominates and Hawaii\nSenator Ronald said women should not going to listen to they should be believed to she told me to shut up and do the right thing for a change to that Lindsey Graham said this sort of regret\nThank you I Know I'm a a single white male from South Carolina and I told I should shut up but I Will not shut up if that's okay because I got here the same way everybody else did\nThe faith on South Carolina voted for me and Senator Scott to be their voice men and women and I'm not trying to be their voice today and uh maybe not just for South Carolina but a little bit about what I think is going on here\n[noise]\nJoy bay her over at the view in mid season form\nDo not want to
