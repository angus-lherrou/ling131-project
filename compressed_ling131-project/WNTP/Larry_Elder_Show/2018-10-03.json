right now with what Brett Kavanaugh is going through it's the double standard\nIt's the double standard that's sort of anger assess because deep down you and I know the truth we do and even if Democrats in the last I don't want to admit it it's the truth you and I know the truth\n... if Kavanaugh world what role if you were on the left if he worried left is charge\nA ... if he weren't going to be left is a member of the Supreme Court if a Democrat president nominated Brett Kavanaugh and everything that's come out and bought Brett Kavanaugh or came out about Brett Kavanaugh he's he wore a leftist Democrat judge you and I know\nWe know the media would not be trying to take him down like the media is trying to take Brett Kavanaugh down and you and I know that that's what makes us angry that's why that's why we're fighting so hard to get this guy nominate to get this guy on the Supreme Court\nLook there's no news to report on Brett Kavanaugh\nExcept the FBI could be done tonight\nReport out today that the FBI could be done as soon as tonight or tomorrow morning with their investigation\nAnd you've got Democrats and Republicans all trying to you know are biased the jury and and and and put out their own slant again\nMy advice to you yesterday still holds today ignore everything until the FBI's out in the FBI may come out tomorrow ... as late as tomorrow morning\nI'm but we may never know the other piece of news today is we may never know what the FBI puts out it's going to go to the White House and Senate are today said that it's not going to be public\nDoesn't matter that matter I have a friend he's a a he's a man on the left he's a Democrat\nAnd he asked me last night Joe I don't get it why\nWhy are you guys like hanging with this guy capping all why ah\nWhy you're trying so hard to get him on the Supreme Court why didn't you just send him\nAnd er nominate that uh that that female charge or get another good conservative but\nThis guy cabinet Scott problems man he was a drinker and high school and a drink or in college he got aggressive he got belligerent man uh there there is like a case against it and show why are you conservatives\nFighting so hard for this guy\nThat's what my liberal friend asked me last night\nAnd you know what I said to him\nI said to him it's because of the double standard that's why that's why we're fighting for better or for for for Brett Kavanaugh\nIt's because the hypocrisy of the media the double standard this is what's made us angry for so long\nBecause we know we know we know that CNN and ABC and NBC and CBS and all of them the Washington Post the New York times the LA Times love them if this for a Democrat judge a nominated by a Democrat president would not be a story or sick at that\nCNN and all the rest are only going after Kavanaugh because he's a conservative judge nominated by Republican presidents\nWhy right there I told them and I didn't raise my voice like I'm raising now but right there that's why we're fighting for this guy it's not fair\n\nWe've had to live with this double standard for years it's not fair that's why we're not getting a lead Brett Kavanaugh go down\nBecause we know I told my friend last night we know his cabinet all were in Democrat he'd already be on the Supreme Court but CNN and all the rest because he's a conservative they declared war on you\nKnow what we got an example right in front of us we've got an example right in front of us how many are you know who is congressman Beto O'Rourke democratic congressmen bay or war he is the Democrat\nRunning for the United States Senate down in Texas against Ted Cruz and he is a Democrat Beto O'Rourke is he is a progressive I mean he's really out there on the left\n\nAnd did you know that it ... it it came out a within the last month that when the war crew was like what is ...\nForties right now early mid forties when Beto O'Rourke a was twenty six years old he got drunk\nGot behind the wheel of a car and rammed into another car and according to the police report when he was twenty six a right drinking and driving ... he\nTried to flee the scene he tried to flee the scene of the crime according to the police report back when he was twenty six years old he tried to flee\nHe tried to escape and the only reason I bring this up is because the national media has ignored that story again I'm not I'm not\nTelling you that that is something that should be looked at or not right I'm explaining all the un every Democrat and leftist who's listening to me right now\nYou want to know why us conservatives are so angry and are not going to let Brett Kavanaugh go down it's because of this\nThe national media has pretty much ignored the ... or ... story\nTwenty six years old get strong he's driving crashes into another car tries to leave the scene tries to get away according to police report he's twenty six years old the national media\nHas barely mentions that story in in in Texas local media\nNot much of a story why because he's a Democrat Beto O'Rourke why because he's a progressive Democrat why because he's running against Ted Cruz media hates Ted Cruz\nI I mean I mean I mean just flip it around imagine just mad Jim Wright miss you get you want to get outside our heads you want to understand why we are fighting so hard for Brett Kavanaugh those of us on the right because just imagine\nImagine that story came out about Ted Cruz that when he was twenty six years old he got a DUI crashed into another car and tried to leave the scene I'll tell you what if that happened to Ted Cruz if Ted Cruz did that\nWhen he was twenty six years old ain't no way Ted Cruz gets reelected\nABC and CBS and CNN they'd be all over that story it would be one of the biggest stories in the country\nIt would be right up there with Brett Kavanaugh it would be right up there with the Russia investigation I'm telling you CNN ABC CBS all the rest if that were Ted Cruz getting the DUI at twenty six getting into an accident trying to leave the scene the national media\nWould declare war on Ted Cruz\nAnd would do everything they can do to make sure Ted Cruz loses but because that happened to bathe or Rourke because ... or Rourke who's a Democrat a lefty did it\nIt's not much of a story and here we got Brett Kavanaugh who what\nExcuse me he drank a lot of beer in high school that's a big story he drank a lot of beer in college that is a story\nNo no it's a story because he's a Republican it's a story because he's a conservative\nThat's why it's a story\nThat I'm not getting down into the weeds here\nI'm not talking about you know the particulars of the event of thirty five years ago I'm not even getting into the weeds about how much he drank in high school or college I'm just telling you this I'm just put this in front of you right now if Iraq Obama nominated Brett Kavanaugh and Brett Kavanaugh wore a Democrat judge\nThis would not be a story\nAnd it's that double standard that those of us on the right to\n\nRefuse to accept and that is why I told my friend last night we are fighting so hard for Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\n\n\n\n\nBut you look at what\nThe media has done outside of that allegedly incident thirty five years ago you look at what the media has done to try to destroy this man\nLooking into every aspect of his life when he was sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen years old\nI said to you the media wouldn't do that if if Brett Kavanaugh or some leftist judge they wouldn't do it\nHey Jim you're on with your ... type job\nSean thank you um [noise] my question actually first of all I completely agree with the media five I think that's completely out of it and [noise] what I was curious about as you're progressive Friday after you discussed which I'm told him the ... people are like you feel at me feel that strong lights\nBecause you get it was he able to get it 'cause it's been a while since I've been able to have it in college\n[laughter] Russia he actually Jim it's a good question he actually said oh I kind of see that now we didn't totally agree with me on the bias but he understood where my anger was coming from [noise]\nOkay well that's a star so that was a gym that was the start\nHe didn't just shrugged his shoulders he kind a God\nThat this is what those of us on the right have had to live with the public arena\nTime to check the more freedom voicemail when you're saying about yo\nYo of his wondering\nWhen we're going to be done on a smaller investigation is just burning up ... million

go choo walls freedom dot com slash pod cast I'm I I'm just so fed up with a double standard\nWhat bothers me more than anything is the double standard what infuriates me more than anything is the double standard Brett Kavanaugh or nominated by a Republican president\n[noise]\nHe's a Republican a lifelong Republican Brett Kavanaugh as he's a conservative\nIn today's terms he's been a conservative judge he would be a conservative justice to the Supreme Court\nAnd because of that because of that\n... and ... and only that Brett Kavanaugh a conservative Republican only because of that the media is trying to take him down the double standard if Brett Kavanaugh were nominated by a Democrat president it Brett Kavanaugh Kevin all were a Democrat\nNominee and and was more of a left is going on the Supreme Court the media would not come after him like they are now it's that double standard\nThat our side\n\nHas been bothered by forever and simply cannot abide by will not take\nSo when people in the middle and people on the left get mad at Trump for calling out the media this is what we feel we've been calling out the media weight before Trump\n\nThis double standard and you know to really see the double standard in real clarity\nAll you need to do\nIs look at the example of\nBeta O'Rourke you know who ... Rourke is don't you he's the Democratic congressman who's running for the United States Senate down in Texas against Ted Cruz\nAnd I don't know for sure that you know but I'm going to make sure you know\nThey know Rourke who now is in his mid forties again just to show you the double standard beta Rourke when he was twenty six years old got a DUI\n\nDrunk driving and in the police report\nThe police report at the time twenty some odd years ago the police report says that twenty six year old ... or tried to flee the scene of the cry\nAfter he hit another car\nWhile under the influence\n[noise]\nNow fatal Rourke is a Democrat in fact he's a a he's a progressive he's a far left Democrat now on this issue\nBagel roar back when he was twenty six a DUI hit another car and then he tried to flee the scene\nA\nDebate or war court Ted Cruz if this came out about Ted Cruz\n\nTed Cruz did the same damn thing when he was twenty six DUI tried to flee the scene of the accident\n\nTed Cruz would be done [noise] Ted Cruz would not get reelected the national media ABC\nAnd CBS and NBC and\nCNN would declare would have declared war on Ted Cruz and they would make it one of the biggest national political stories in the country in fact\n\nThey were to put it right up there with Brett Kavanaugh of able to put it right up there with the Russia investigation if that had been Ted Cruz\n\nWho when he was twenty six years old got a DUI and tried to flee\nThe scene it would be a huge story and for all intents and purposes Ted Cruz's um reelection bid would be over\nBut because bagel Rourke as a Democrat a progressive Democrat the media generally has kinda ignored it barely made a mention of it\nI'm Talking about the national media\nYou know in Texas again you've got different newspapers in Texas some of made an issue out of it some habit habit but I'm Talking about the national media\nBrett Kavanaugh nominee or to the Supreme Court ah drank too much in high school and college they say oh my word [noise] stop the presses we got to do something about\n\nHere's Beto O'Rourke a United States Senate candidate down in Texas\n\nObviously drinking too much when he's twenty six years old that's not high school that's not college\nAnd it's barely covered\nEight is the double standard that sends us over the edge it is the double standard that\nOur side must never ever stop railing about\nAs long as I've got this microphone I'm\nGoing to continue to talk about it and more seen it up close and personal with Brett Kavanaugh right here I Know you know everybody knows that what we call you know the Democrat media\nCNN and ABC and CBS and NBC and MSNBC and CNBC and PBS\nAll of them Washington Post New York times all of them you know the biggest networks\nOutside of Fox the biggest cable networks the biggest newspapers in the country the way that they have been covering this Brett Kavanaugh case they would not cover it this way they would not even come close to covering it this way if\nKavanaugh were nominated by say Brock Obama\nAnd for those Democrats and left these listening to me right now\n\nYou can disagree with me if you'd like I'm explaining to you\nThe feeling that my side conservatives in this country have had forever\nI mean a long time before Donald Trump Trump is just the first Republican candidate for president and then Republican president who has said I'm not going to ignore the double standard I'm not going to ignore the bias\nI'm going to call it out I'm going to call it out\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six hundred\n\nFeet so fundamentally wrong and as long as this double standard exists\nWe conservatives we libertarians\nAre will match sapphire attacks on [noise]\n[noise] you're\nIt's time that he's getting his\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six Andrea you would be stunned\nUm\nYou you really would be stunned if you knew how many Americans\nAre\n\nReally did hold that\nThat that are all these women have to be believed\n\nI mean my word my lord if we ever get to a point in this country where\n\nJust an accusation an allegation\nCan put somebody away where just an allegation an accusation a determines kill\n\nI don't care what skin color you are and and I don't care what race you are and I don't care what ... are\nUh\nWe we can't get there we should never be there\nAnd I want to believe that uh most Americans regardless of race or sex\nAgree with that understand that because if we set that precedent here if we do away with that basic fundamental we over use that word but that fundamental\nPrinciple of American Justice presumed innocent not not innocent until proven guilty not innocent until proven guilty presumed innocent\nThere's big difference there but if we do away with that\nIf we toss Brett Kavanaugh aside no matter what\nYou think of Brett Kavanaugh no matter where you are politically\n\nIf you let that go here presumed innocent until proven guilty if you let that go here you are not getting it back\n\nAnd and you on the left in Democrats you're going to be bit okay there's going to come a time there's going to come a point\nIn the not too distant future where five for one of you will get tossed to the side of the road [noise] SUV the guilty just based on ...

they fell off\nNow you've got to say athletes they might have been drinking but if they were intent on taking her clothes off why is it not one of them was able to grab her aggressor armor and to read from before she could get out\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and I've heard nothing asked about that\nAll excellent questions Hillary even says that ah Christine forest testimony she cannot say with a hundred percent truthful\nI Want to ask you a question about Dr for for a minute there are a lot of Democrats who are in a lot of other people who are absolutely certain hundred percent her her recollection is the absolute truth I'm asking this as a lawyer do you feel a hundred percent certain that the events that she described um ah are true and are therefore disqualify\nLook I I watch as much of protests money as I could I found her very credible you have to ask yourself why would anybody put themselves through this if they\nDid you ask a question about when he to Broderick\nDid not

exchange between ... between Chris Cuomo and Rick Santorum hormone keeps saying that Kevin testified that he was pure that he was so we're we're no you didn't\nIf he's lying about anything in this context short of his actions toward the women who are making the accusations do you think that that is not disqualifying record\nWell look I first off I don't know how you're going to prove that he's caught lying about something that I mean this this is what he's he said that he drank he said that he drank to access at times that he was drunk at times they hit ... to that the only thing he did not admit to his\nWas blacking out and not recalling things and he has you know he has his his college roommate basically you know saying you know I live with this guy for three years I never saw him in his position for the next thing that ever for selling on\n... ah did also said they never saw him blackout I don't know that the blackout standard is the sole criteria and I know and you're\nSaying

I guess it was a a sort of assumptions that you could you know talk this kind of inside baseball for ... I mean I was very very uncomfortable with what a what a lot of\nThe promises that went into this whole uh you know interaction I mean there was an assumption that of course you want to get rid of the blacks and that this young Harvard educated\nNow what was that but it's going to come up with a great solution had accomplished that it was awful\nAnd it was humorous planned the one that you just outlined about relocating them on the basis of these are going to be refurbished and then they get right at first refusal they wouldn't be able to do a forward to pay for it and voila they would be gone with Schumer outlining this plan right and that's\nIt yeah and they were selling them to say look what a genius he came up with a strategy would have thought of this is a massive stroke\nMhm now this plant never gotten implement it or do you know why not\nWell they do get it for months and then that they do they're refurbishing but ah they underestimated the capacity of the people to move back they they were able to raise the father came back\nMost of them and there's pretty much the neighborhood is the same as always been except that uh the blacks ended up with with better housing which was up to the good but that was not the U.S has\nWhat is your father think of this plan\nWell my father was not really that political figure and uh and I didn't really discuss it with him I was a teenager and to me it was is revolting mhm [noise] so\nUm why did you take so long before writing about this she was sixteen years old but you didn't write about it as a kid\nAt the time but that but that's really what got me motivated to politics at all the years as I was getting engaged and as a writer I used to ride for the Jewish magazines that eventually a broad and into the Washington DC magazines and I was working my way up\nThe ladder so to speak I always wanted to tell my story and in fact in Nineteen Ninety six\nI was a there was a fellow named Robert L Virgo who's running against ... for Congress and I actually went to apply to become his campaign manager and like you know who you are like where did you come from I don't understand I this man is is\nA you know evil personified I if I could do I think to bring him down I was so so of course uh the local Republicans I never heard of me at the time and I and I didn't get the job but [noise] but uh so just to show you how passionate I was about that and I was also particularly offensive because\nHe was the congressman for a very orthodox Jewish section in New York [noise] uh he would go around and and pans it to them or talk a little year this stuff like that mhm and then he would take their votes\nThese is that we're really holy wonderful people and he would use their votes for all the evil society they might as well it couldn't show was the most reliable vote for Bush is anything any type of thing that that involves\nA you know undermining right traditional society is the most reliable vote and his power came from Los ... sweet people who who is ... ... what is what\nWe're putting ... article one Larry on the dot com race to the top by Jay Honda Jay thank you very much for coming on maybe this time somebody will finally asked Chuck Schumer about this Jay thanks for coming on actually\nThe and I really appreciate it always a plus you\nGot it and now Schumer is blasting Kevin off for lacking the appropriate demeanor of a judge what kind of demeanor did you show when you were pushing that raises plan to get rid of blacks sir\nIf you say well maybe he's telling the truth and maybe he's not he doesn't belong on the Supreme Court\nAnd I think most Americans are saying that again even if you want to discount that some people do what happens when he was Fifteen in high school and Eighteen in college\nAnd how were you when you propose that racist scheme that Jay on that just spoke about [noise]\nYou cannot to camp where he is saying and protesting at age fifty three\nHey if you were a racist in Nineteen Seventy four you're probably a racism twenty Eighteen right\nWhen it flies in the face being truthful unbelievable that's the key question here there and demeanor you shorten show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing there is partisanship he brought out\nThe most raw form of partisanship so under coming of someone on the district court federal appeals court let alone the Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd he did not show\nAny semblance to always being a hundred per cent honest than truthful which is what we need and the Supreme Court justice\nNow this week that the FBI
