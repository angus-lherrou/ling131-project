{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "Or the Mueller pro and here we are dealing with judge Kavanaugh but meanwhile there are real\nSerious issues that affect us on a daily basis I mean think about it for just a moment how 'bout kids in foster care\nAre you ready to stand in the gap for kids in foster care\nWell Dr Sharon for joins us now issues with focus in the family nationally recognized child welfare workers a welfare consultant and the retired manager for a permanent sea services for the Colorado Department of Human Services in the division of child welfare services used the former president\nOf the national association of state adoption programs and the association of administrators for the interstate compact\nOn adoption of medical assistance Dr Ford welcome to bill Martinez live our him\nOh thank you I'm Glad to be with you today\nWell great to have you here as I said in the intro I'm it's easy for us to get distracted with so much hyperbole and emotions flying around our country right now but we we've got kids in foster care that need help doing not\nWe do actually there's over four hundred thousand children across the nation that are in foster care and many of those children are right there in the backyard of the our listeners\nExactly what you think about what these kids are going through I'm fairly miserable young lives these kids in foster care and not all but most\nOf some with the biological parents who were you know in jail on drugs or abusive [noise] um you know it's rare that they get a a a happy or a joyous memory is it not\n[noise] you know there are so many challenges that kids have faced as they entered the foster care system and you've said it their parents have gotten addicted to drugs or alcohol they have fallen on really hard time saying that struggled\nAnd children and I had been abandoned they've been neglected and some of them yes even abused\nAnd so No Child should have to be living through that and this day and age\nExactly what kind of fair shot to they have it live if this is the way they were raised in and their parents are dealing with this and you know what are the chances of that they ended up like their parents\nYou know the fair shot is this that government and their narrow scope of work it's supposed to protect the children so when they remove them from their challenged homes it's the government's responsibility to recruit families to care for them because government\nCan't shouldn't raise children and so who are those families courageous who are sitting in the few that let's say yes to\nGod and become foster parents so that the children could be nurtured and loved on provided structure and guidance 'em and had an opportunity to heal while their parents are getting the help that they need\nSometimes Dr forward people are unrealistic about the reach of government and this is what gets government in trouble is that we all have a link to play in solving this problem in a lame to be and then this is what I Am seeing more and more\nAnd when government gets outside of its lame like any of us can do it anytime 'cause we see something as good observation wrong conclusion kind of thing\nAnd uh we meddle into things and sometimes we give the government too much credit and when that happens and we think that the government is going to be your daddy a boy that just opens up all kinds of problems does it not\nThat slide government's role is to actually set a narrow lane it's about safety and protection and recruiting families to care for children um until the government can stay in its Elaine and the church and the community would step up\nAnd play the critical role that they can play it makes all the difference in the world and the life of a child\nOr doctor for the church has been discouraged to play a role as you know because uh all under the guise of separation of church and state\nUh you know the government can't be perceived as supporting a ... you know any kind of face or you know anything that has to do with religion but this is the big live it's been perpetrated on our culture and meanwhile is ah our kids are our future for tomorrow's is all\nBeing compromised all because of the bogeyman of religion\n[laughter] you you you you tell the truth there that um sometimes government struggles to realize that there are rich pockets of families and all over their community who could make a difference in the lives of these children if government would open the door and say you know what let's focus on the children these\nChildren need to be nurtured and ... my family's come through the process\nTo become foster parents so that they cannot only live on that child but help love on that first family who is struggling and going through their treatment needs so maybe\nIt's because we know a God that is a redeeming or exactly maybe\nThose children could go back home to their birth families um\nAt the church would step up and as they as you said they tried and if government would say yes yes we want to access these rich pockets of families who can love on kids love on those birth families and so that they were being many more children maybe having the opportunity to go home\n[noise] are you going to tell me doctor I Know you're not going to tell me this maybe it's more rhetorical this question but as\nA people or people of a secular rise mindset are more equipped to teach morale would be then people who have face\nI think that that's an interesting question and I I Can't tell you that I've ever studied it what\nI can tell you is that um people who share values about children all along\nFamilies and then that they respect that um\nThat children deserve structure that children need to know who they are um and who they are that children need an opportunity to have an education that\nThe um is rich with all kinds of opportunities for how the experiences that I'm\nChallenge their minds and and helped to shape and grow them in the image of who they you know should be that as long as we have a level playing field than children will do better um then then by folks might want to skew with that picture should look like\nWell I think people need to appreciate the with God you don't have a level playing field it's to your advantage I Will say that I have two points real clear in terms of empirical evidence let's take a look at the school system in the sixties we decided the ten commandments was irrelevant we need to get it out of their\nUh we've got it on to their look what happened in our school system has been absolutely decimate is is there any correlation with the uh you know since we took God out of schools is there any correlation to the effectiveness of the education system today\nI think our school system has\nUm has gotten off track their teaching things in school today that they would have never taught in the sixties seventies and eighties\nOr nineties for that matter [noise] um and because our kids are taking down bunny trails and I think that really aren't relevant about them being able to um reading writing and arithmetic and not knowing how to eat the social and I'm the kind to one another that needs to go\nBack to being a values based\nUm educational system that we can grow and learn I'm taking the commandments out of the school or what not so much now shall not kill no show not steal on of your mother and father\nWell that's\nWrong with those basic structures that helped shape a school we are as people\nWill because when you take that out of the uh\nOut of the marketplace and and the area of debate then you have what's on display in our country today to just member meant a of individuals\nThe disrespect of individuals and of course we're not going to talk about sixty million aborted babies are in terms of a lack of respect for life and you have women today because of their claim that it's their body\nUm another big lie this being thrust upon women but to many women understand that ah it's more than just their body especially if they're married\nOr you know that's a whole nother conversation but Dr Ford I you know imagine for just a moment focus of the focus on the family with all the great work that they do and support and everything\nIs focused on the family was secular rise to what would that organization look like\nWe wouldn't be the organization we are today\nYou know without all on so many levels on so many levels the ideas that are in Dr Daley at all and you know the team come up with a you know the support system everything is just so wonderful and I'm sure\nThe gym daily would tell you I'm the guy gets all the glory that it is God and but for God focus on the family would not be in existence\nWe wouldn't you know we stand for biblical principles\nAnd writes is right we can agree to disagree but we agree on this principle that God is God and there is none other and when his principles say that really I'm walking love our ministry walks in love with God's\nWe have had a lot of listeners who are anxious to get some good scary programming and so we have been listening\nYeah we haven't back
