Walsh freedom dot com hey they're coming again\nRight now as we speak their due to arrive at our southern border in mid November and their group is expanding right now you've got a few thousand migrants\nHonduran migrants' rights same old story their march and they're marching up to our southern border marching through Guatemala them they'll march through Mexico and then they'll come knocking on\nOur door the caravan is due to arrive mid November and if this story sounds familiar it's because this happened earlier again this year you had a couple of thousand migrants I Believe then from Guatemala who came to our southern border they marched up took him about a month or two\nThey got to our board of the TV cameras were there to CNN and ABC man they loved it these poor children these poor refugees we've got to give him asylum\nIn the media in this country did their dance they did their song and dance and they're going to do it again\nThat thankfully President Trump came out today and said ah I\nI'm Sorry uh we've informed the government of Honduras that if the large caravan of people heading to the U.S is not stopped and bought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective immediately that's what President Trump tweeted this morning\nTrying to stop this caravan of what are we talking about people trying to come into the country illegally\nThen you look at the difference here right\nBetween what Trump says and what Obama said when this kind of thing went down when Obama was president\nI mean my God we remember the days of Obama we were like advertising down in Mexico and Central America we were advertising down there about how wonderfully general risk the government benefits are appear under Obama we're doing that down there we were advertising down there\nTo get these refugees and migrants to come into this country Trump today making clear again that he's not Obama trying to stop\nThis march now because he knows Trump knows what's gonna happen because it happened before when those almost two thousand migrants showed up at our border back in may again the pictures were heart wrenching and CNN and all the rest they played up the story how can we deny\nAsylum to these poor migrants these refugees how can we denies an entrance into this country\nBut what a lot of Americans don't know and don't realize is that most of those migrants back then\nThey were in fact allowed to come into this country when the cameras went away and when the Trump Administration stop talking about him we let most of them in and that's what will happen again\nThey're not stupid these people and the people who put them on these marches they know if they can just get up\nTo our southern border there will be TV cameras there and the pictures will be so devastating that the Trump Administration like they did before is going to have to back down and let them and now I'm Glad that President Trump\nMade very clear today to what is all ready almost three thousand\nFlorence marching up right now right now to our southern border they're due to arrive in mid November and Trump right now smartly lie so he's trying to stop them in their tracks\nIt should be so simple\nIt shouldn't even be up for a debate\nNobody has a right to just march from anywhere and march into this country no matter how things are back in your country nobody has a right to be here\nYou and I know that here's my fear though my fear is they're going to get to our border\nAnd even though you and I know that even though the Trump Administration right now is publicly saying that just like in may if these illegals if these migrants get to our border the pressure to let them come in is going to be too great it happened before it will happen again\nYou can't let them cannot let him\nWe are a country of laws we are a country rules we are a sovereign nation we have a border that border much being forced to keep that borders not enforced tell we're not even a country\nLet's hope the Trump Administration stays from because these folks are on their way I'm Joe Walsh\nSteve so perfect because they never talk about those things do they\n\nDo where do they go yeah you know Steve you write the ... ... ... I'll tell you what they come into this country ... [laughter] it's just such\nA frustrating issue because most people don't realize that right now we're practicing catch and release right now as we speak\nSo we detain them Steve at the border we detain them for twenty four hours and then we give him a court date a three four months down the road and we just let them go into our country and in most of them we never hear from again\nThey disappear into our country they find family they find friends they find communities\nAnd before you know it right there getting public ... they're getting welfare they're getting Obamacare they're getting all of that\nIt should be so simple it just don't let them\nAnd let me quickly go to will I Will\nSay July ... I'm good man\nAnd got us up at your uh uh uh George Soros or care to big big cash that that the air that ah [laughter]\nI wouldn't doubt if he's probably got it but\nI I think as far as the man goes a joke Trump's gotta you gotta you gotta talk up artist chance really chai Detroit laws that are\nNo no I\nDidn't know he can do whatever the hell we watch I'm a singer and we'll it's a great question but no the president of the United states can do what ever key lots on our border\nHe can do what ever she wants to defend this country he has wide latitude and let's hope let's hope that he if if these folks get here mid November let's hope that he\nExercises the authority he has um ...

on the line stay there I'll get to you in a second good news out of Atlanta good ... good news by the way\nA for everybody who believes in freedom and religious freedom good news for the alliance defending freedom the city of Atlanta has reached a one point two million dollar settlement\nWith X fire chief Kevin Cochrane\nWho was fired\nThe Atlanta fire chief who was fired back in twenty Fifteen because he started a men's Bible study and he wrote a book in which she um expressed his Christian views on sex and marriage\nThis happened back in twenty Fifteen and because a\nFire chief Kevin Cochran did that\nWrote a one hundred and sixty two page a devotional entitled who told you that you were naked and it it it it expresses his Christian view is the biblical perspective on sexual ethics and morality\nBecause he wrote that book and gave copies of that book\nTo some of his fellow firefighters\nThe city of Atlanta suspended him\nA forced him to undergo a thirty day sensitivity training without pay a and she was ultimately fired\nAtlanta fire chief Kevin Cochrane was because of his Christian faith\nFast forward what almost three years\nAnd ah X. fire chief Kevin Cochran\nHas settled with or the city of Atlanta has settled with Kevin Cochran to the tune of one point two million dollars because the city of\nUh Atlanta understood that they had no grounds for what they did step being all over this man's face\nAnd stepping all over this mantra religious freedom I mean think about it you're the fire chief of Atlanta\nYou start a men's a Bible study you write a book that talks about your Christian faith\nAnd you get copies of that book to your fellow fire men and fire women and because you do that the city of Atlanta suspend Shia forces you to undergo sensitivity training and eventually fires you why because you are a Christian\nNow for the life of me I don't know why Republicans are afraid to say what I just said Trump talks tough on this issue he backed down last time I we should continue to talk tough\nAnd then I Hope he doesn't back down and I I I Wish the Republicans would join him but they're generally afraid of this issue let me go to Tom tom\nHey Joe ... thanks so you know I think we all have a lot of empathy for these refugees right I mean I I think everybody can kind of agree to that but you know I I don't necessarily agree with the with an earlier caller that there you know about the wealth of the nation right the last I Know we're in a deficit right yeah I mean I'm thinking about it every dollar we spend\nTo provide aid to pay the people that are processing them as a dollar we got to borrow\nRight and if you put it into that kind of perspective do we really want to borrow a dollar\nNo ... ... ... a look man you're right you're you're right what our [laughter] we\nHave to borrow money take care of these people\nAnd it's not a dollar that you and I are going to spend but it's a dollar that our kids are going to have to spend yeah right and you multiply that by thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars yes you know it's it it just gets ridiculous and I think it's you know we got to wrap it up into some sort of perspective right that\nYeah logical sense that people can kind of just you know understand\nIt's got to stop it's got to stop\nAnd and by the way you don't need to say that we're\nWe're a a a big hearted people and and nobody who thinks like I Do needs to be defensive on this issue I think I'm a big hearted guy but doggone it I Want a secure border I don't want people in my country illegally I'm a nice guy I'm a fun guy I'm a loving guy I'm a God fearing Christian but I don't want anybody in my country illegally\nAnd they don't have to apologize for that hey Dennis give you the final word

other day about Trump's instability eighty percent of Charleston to really have you peel the onion ... ability is brought about by people who are tacky em and attacking our ah approach\nTo dealing with these issues the other thing and lastly hang up and listen\nAnd by the wing is Dennis hold your final one 'cause I'll give you the final word but let me push back against that one look I'll use a lot of words to describe Trump and I knew who he was when I voted for him civil is not a word I use to describe him he's a disruptor look Trump entered the\nScene punching everybody in the face man figuratively that's how he became the front runner I'm I'm just not gonna complain when people try to punch him back he punches ... peeled hundred lobby tall ape punches people when they punch him cars but uh\nI think he punched his first two and I think he punched first when he came on the scene but give me your fire and I went\nI did say eighty percent of the final thought let's go find me a cage let's get ...\nAnd I use nine nine and a car and let\nThem deal with this because if if they're so social and open it let them go up their\nTime with you there man Dennis I'm with you there

engine\nThat will be censored by the Chinese government Mugele wants to show badly get into the China market that they're willing to let the government censor their search engine\nI guess this hasn't even set well with most Google employees who are pretty left of center I I think this is kind of problematic it's sparked a real internal debate of Google it should spark a real debate around the world\nYou're going to sell your soul like that Google\nYou're going to sell your soul to the Chinese government just to make some money\nTo to let the Chinese government censor your search engine\nI

Street and listen to me [noise]\nGo to Wall Street um dot com slash listen if he misses show catch the podcast Walsh freedom dot com\nSlash pod cast a eight five five six for two fifty six\nHundred um the biggest issue of the campaign\nOr if you look at most reports in most studies or appears to be health care [noise]\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are acknowledging\nHealth care\nUh is is the number one issue on the minds of voters this fall\nOr in fact uh I've seen poll after poll after poll after poll\nAnd every single poll after poll after poll after poll I've seen has\nHas said that to me\nThat health care is number one number one issue usually followed by economy the jobs and on down the line\nBut it's health care health care and what's interesting is when I got elected in two thousand and ten\nHealth care was the issue that an specifically was Obamacare and in two\nThousand and ten when I ran in two thousand and twelve and then really two thousand and fourteen as well\nRepublicans were the ones talking about health care [noise] Democrats\nDidn't want to mention that because Obamacare was really unpopular\nUm\nSend to Iran and twenty ten and a bunch of Republican draining twenty ten and we promised to repeal Obamacare you remember all that you remember\nOf that don't you ride just give us control of of the house and Senate and baby we Republicans will repeal Obamacare route ten branch I think we set\nRoute and branch\nRight [noise] well funny thing happened and oh by the way just so we're clear\nWhen in fact\nYou voters you the voters\nWhen in fact you did in fact give Republicans the keys to Washington DC a couple of years ago I remember you gave Republicans the house and the Senate and the White House\nYou remember they didn't repeal Obamacare did not we'd been screaming for it and cry and for for eight years\nComing back when I was in Congress when I got elected Republicans only controlled the house Harry Reid and the Democrats controlled the Senate Obama was in the White House\nThe very first vote\nMade in the house was to repeal Obamacare\nBut we knew it wouldn't go anywhere we knew it wouldn't go anywhere easy is vote any Republican ever made repeal Obamacare knowing it\nWould pass the house and the Senate Harry Reid and the Democrats would never take it up and if Harry Reid and the Democrats for some bizarro reason took it out\nOf Iraq Obama would most certainly veto it [noise] so for a couple of years they're Republicans kept repeating voting to repeal Obamacare knowing that it wouldn't go anywhere because it was easy\nAnd their voters wanted to hear it and\nThen in twenty fourteen when you gave the Republicans the United States Senate as well\n\nThe Senate never voted on repealing Obamacare and then in twenty sixteen when the Republicans hit the trifecta control of\nControl of the Senate Donald Trump a Republican in the White House\nWell\nNo more excuses right Republicans they had no more excuses\n\nFor eight years they've been scream and just please give us control\nPlease give us control and will repeal it all\nBooths poops dog catch his car now what will now it's not an easy vote\nSo makes you wonder and in fact you know that Republicans some time awhile ago stopped really wanting to repeal Obamacare\nIt was all just a game it was all just an act\nOr to get you the voters riled up you'd\nVoters did your job in twenty sixteen you gave him the whole town he gave in Washington D. C. and once they were in complete control they didn't repeal Obamacare\n\nAnd don't just blame John McCain for ...\nYou know putting this dumb down the Republicans in the Senate or glad McCain voted against that the Republicans in the house we're glad McCain voted against it\nThe truth is the Republican Party by about twenty fourteen or Fifteen or understood that they they weren't going to repeal Obamacare and they stopped wanting to repeal Obamacare than they only said they were going to repeal it because they knew he wanted to hear [noise]\nAnd so we had that exercise back in twenty Seventeen last year Republicans back and forth back and forth back and forth and they just can't repeal it\nSo they ... around with a revised it edited it tried to make it a little better here a little worse there that's out what we needed a\nWas one of those rare Republicans who back in the day screened about repealing the whole thing that I\nStill feel that way and if I were still in the house I wouldn't have voted to repeal all of it but I understood that I was in the minority in my own party\nSo a funny thing than happened a couple of years ago\nRepublicans started excuse me stopped talking about health care Republicans kinda sorta weasels away from talk of Obamacare\nAnd all of a sudden last year\nIt was the Democrats that made\nHealthcare they're issue eight years ago Obamacare\nQuite literally cost Democrats control of Congress\n\nForward eight years of their talk about health care and Obamacare\nDamn well might put them back in control of Congress what happened what changed\nWhy was this such a bad issue\nFor Democrats eight years ago\nAnd why is it such a good issue now and why we're\nThe only ones talking about Obamacare and healthcare eight years ago\nAnd now it's Democrats doing all the talking about health care\nIt's a big change will get into the why here in a minute but it's a big change and when you look at all these campaign ads around the country these days right now\nA big chunk of them\nAre centered around have to do with health care\nJak Democrats aren't even afraid to say the word Obamacare I mean when I was in Congress [noise] eight years ago Democrats\nThey were afraid to say the gosh darn word\nSwear to God not any more [noise]\nAh things have changed eight five five six for two fifty six hundred it's not a good thing but things have changed\nAnd [noise]\n[noise] see we we\nI wasn't alone but we knew this would happen you\nGive the American people something and that's what Obama was\n\nEventually the American people are going to get used to that something\nThen eventually the American people are going to like being given something\nAnd then you'll never be able to get rid of it is something you just gave the American people\nWelfare health care\nAny any ... any benefit from the government\n\nWhat did Ronald Reagan say right what Reagan say the most difficult thing in the world to get rid of is is a government program\nWindow when have we ever gotten rid of of a government program\nI mean hell I went to Congress in twenty ten\nThinking that we would get rid of this program or get rid of that program would cut spending baloney\nRepublicans had no interest in doing any of that\n[noise]\nSo yeah\nAnd you gave the American people something than Obamacare and now the American people have grown used to it and daylight and getting things they like getting free stuff\nAnd so now Obamacare is popular\nThe Democrats notice\nSo Democrats are talking about Obamacare Republicans notice you see like a\nA candidate for governor in Michigan\nRepublican bill shoot 'em he's trying to he's trying to paint himself as a champion of a government health care in the state of Michigan\nBack in twenty ten
