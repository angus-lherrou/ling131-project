the way back to the original Bush with a funny socks on what's this love affair with the royal family who has no problem\nA telling women can't drive running the country with an iron fist in fact it's one of the only countries where slavery is wide open and accepted and it's just part of the culture\nI don't understand why we have this ideology where Saddam Hussein was a bad guy okay I get it well he looked like an altar boy compared to the royal family\nAnd what the thing with the royal family what do we know about these people all of a sudden we liked this guy why do we like he's going to let women drive that seems okay he locked up his cousin and he seems to shave off whatever money you want\nTo run the country like at that spot\nBut now they're our favorite because they buy weapons from us\nOr do we stand on principle here is the only thing I've got a call is already and I love it when we get callers on the line by the way if you want to participate you know the number\nIs it about that they purchased weapons from us or is it that we use Saudi Arabia to fight a proxy wars in the middle east which one is it because sometimes there are a friend but when you look at who they give money to\nHow are they are friends they give money to a lot of our enemies they give money to Syria they give money to Afghanistan they give money to Nigeria they give money to Egypt they give money to China right we all have China they give money to Jordan\nTo Tanzania they give money to virtually all the places where radical Islam seems to be stoked seems to be popping up so it was Saudi Arabia ... these are our guys now listen\nI agree with a lot of the callers on the line well there's this other guy we don't know much about him no we don't we know he was an American a naturalized citizen we know he lived in Virginia right we know that he see what else is in Virginia\nLangley it's right CIA in probably coincidence probably a coincidence you kind of went\nUh came and went as ... as he wanted to um had a lot of access seems to have known a lot of the CIA guys to 'em and then he disappeared and and I understand he was killed in a horrific way that it really has no bearing on on my problem with it\nI have a hard time being spoon fed propaganda whether it's economic propaganda or whether it's Saudi propaganda and one thing that seems to be a common denominator in a lot of our problems in the middle east Saudi Arabia\nAnd work to believe the royal family that practices all kinds of atrocities in fact if you look at what's been going on in Yemen for over two years now it would make Sherman blush\nThe fact that we just had a school but they they just said a school bus or a month and a half ago forty kids four hundred thousand homes blown up\nAnd all with American weapons and we know why you think it has to do with oil transport through the through the streets I bet it does [laughter]\nWhy are we picking winners and losers not only that why are we not recognizing this country is funding\nForeign aid to our enemies yet we're fighting for them because they buy weapons from us I'd like to know if you really broke it down or we'll only on the money to buy the weapons from a school that's my favorite ... what's our foreign policy to Saudi Arabia solid I'll tell you what we're going to go to a line\nTo me if they were going to Kansas where you live

break it up and that's\nHow I have an actor I'm having a hard time okay my gripe is that all that happened with that I thought he guy oh we get in the sky\nThat a Saudi guy he's an American guy out he said the diet and turkey now I'm not by the way he landed\nThe chorus line we get this course mine oh you have to do that you know this way you know the president has to do that in my opinion Muslim Brotherhood on you know\n... it seems very coordinated so and and I really don't care what happened to him by about ... look at how they treat their people why don't we worry about\nThat oh wait a minute we who look how who\nTreats people\nI'm Talking about the middle east\nThe Saudis see because you're getting another chorus line and you're not talking about\nTurkey or non look like I'm a journalist in jail and we're worried about one guy\nWell I'll I'm obviously I I tend to kind of agree with that basic point but if that's if you and I agree on that why do we also agree that we should give Saudi Arabia a country that is known that is known to be ruthless to have sleep our own country why are they are ...\n[noise] I Know why there are pounds under Trump Trump is against the Muslim Brotherhood X Y and their doctors alliance\nSo the alliances the Muslim Brotherhood is good the theocracy right because that's what you say I was actually the accuracy is bad but instead we're going to accept the pretend royals the inbred rabbit dish wrap wrapped in a tape of course these guys are our friends by the way the guys who torturing kill as many people as they want without question\nThe guys who right now you really think that he was locked down the street you can't drive down the street and Saudi Arabia\nI don't think they eat with our fundamental English done and what I knew who Trump you want to know what I Want to do tennis\nI Want to break them economically because here's the other thing they're threatening Trump I don't know if you if you're caught that\nWas on a it was all over the news CNN as we're uh I saw the article printed it was also in blue ... Bloomberg they threatened him with four hundred dollar oil see this is the other thing we made Saudi Arabia what uh what it is today we did our Sherman anti trust that with the with the center Rockefeller and all the other oil companies to the middle east\nWe have discovered since then oceans of oil under our own country we don't need to buy an ounce of it from anybody\nWe that's how we could break the middle east\nBut for some reason we don't do that\nFor some reason we let Saudi Arabia dictate the oil price\nFor some reason we sit idly by and they decide how much to pump went to pump it what the price should be that's a price fixing and whose price fixing it the guys who are really our enemies\nWho tend to tell us they're our friends and and no one investigated all of the people that attacked us on September eleventh had the habits of common denominator there they're all Saudis\nBut I Know there are friends it's crazy to me give me a tough\nTopic is so much for calling the Joe Walsh program we only got a couple of minutes so give me\nHit me I'll Try to be quick a reason for my call is this during the campaign Donald growth basically campaign ran in one and two grand that this one was the Mexican wall\nAnd one was the Muslim the Muslim the Muslim okay now I find it very interesting that he's taken office and all of a sudden we got the trouble with the Saudis which is a there's a relationship that goes back here\nWhich is why I'm not blaming trial the IRS why I'm not blaming Trump I'm really not\nThis goes back like you said for fifty years for Fifteen Years they've been undermining us for fifty years they smile at our face and stab us in the back for Fifteen Years we lose the money that we pretend they buy our products from so this is beyond from\nThis is an issue of our policy and who knows how to fit it keeps these wars going you know I'm going to have a guest on uh at five thirty five and I'm going to ask a window supporting your ally transfer over to a proxy war because the ... yeah go ahead\nIs what my ... like it's very complicated is a lot of moving parts but the notion for my call was all the quote unquote Trump's Thursday voted for him two years ago now are totally in bed because the quote unquote arms sales because the oil yeah God says it's a good thing that the reason\nFor what I'll tell you what I think you're a little biased because you're an anti I get it I don't like a lot of his policies but this is my new sat in his shoe which if you listen to how Trump brand he ran right he wanted to get us out of there all of a sudden he wins we're not going anywhere not only that we're fighting proxy wars but it is bigger than a president\nThis was a policy that controls will solve this is a policy that is steeped in corruption steeped in collusion this the biggest game of the modern day my name is Shawn confident for Joe Walsh we'll be back after this\n\n\n[noise]\n\nFrom Afghanistan to China to everybody in between they in fact they threatened Trump today or for the prince by four hundred dollar a barrel oil by saying that they will colluding with Iran who is supposedly they're sworn enemy\nThe point is to recognize that this ideology itself is our enemy and to break the middle east by becoming completely energy independent which we could do overnight\nAnd we refuse to do with why because there is a money flow to politicians from the Saudis there's money flow from the old ... countries there was money flow from the European Union it's about enriching the politicians who pretend to be representative when they're not the represent themselves\nBy can be a gym we got one last call acquainted up before Jim thank you so much for calling to show how are you shocked thank you that's how\nI spend a little time in the middle east mostly in Saudi Arabia\nBacking forty five eighty six\nI was there\nBy vice president Bush for a visit to the Saudis he was doing all they're\nDoing all the ... is one of their their their minds are garden all the classified material ... pretty nice powers and this is gold everywhere sure\nOK slaves it's about four or five days after the whole thing that weren't slaves all the secret service guys when the guys don't travel with him yeah based on what's called the wheels up parties oh\nSo they're all standing around his party and now you know Saudi Arabia's dry unless you're on\nThe compound she had like Atlantic sit on your end up to ...

of the matter is I probably won't be able to get within the same room as you and then there's another twelve months so I'm going to take this opportunity to pick your brain and good let me ask you the question is way Saudi Arabia I have never been fooled by them I have seen them using us to price protect oil\nTo militarily protect their country as they run pretty much\nA certain kind of despotism that is only handed down through a phony blue blood inbred bloodline and I noticed that they keep giving money to a lot of people that don't like us\nThey keep giving money to ah Afghanistan they keep giving money to China they even give money to North Korea and I don't believe that they're a relationship with Iran is is I see as the as the press wants us to believe am I wrong now I realize this is a Muslim Brotherhood guy that they chopped up and to tell you the truth I don't like them either\nBut my point is I Want America to be energy efficient I think we could economically bankrupt them well benefiting the world through very low oil prices 'cause we are sitting on the oceans of it\nAnd I think we allow them to do this because we want to fight proxy wars am I wrong\nWell I I agree with you as far as that it would be better for the United states to become energy and and then especially with the fracking revolution a witch routed to the enormous potential that represents for ... you know basically breaking ourselves free from the ... like Saudi Arabia and others\nAre I totally agree with that here's the thing but in the meanwhile\nThe United states is bound up in\nAn alliance structure in the middle east we have our friends there and we have our enemies and\nFor a number of reasons and I think they're good ones that serious on Saudi Arabia as trouble sometimes they are as as lonesome and a despotic as they are and use that and as as a\nMischievous as they can be nevertheless there are friends in the region or among their friends the other ones include Israel Jordan

now take this number down just call one eight hundred six nine one eighty nine Seventy nine or\nAnd not everything is just fine do what pet wants us to do and just trust the politicians\nAnd as I I think about the people who are whether it's Trump or Obama or Bush we mean trust the politician trusting the politician\nIs not only exactly what he what he wants you to do but it gets you into positions where we know lie about debt we're okay we pretend it's twenty two trillion and we're all phony outrage when you really factor in what we're obligated for is ten times that\nWhen we pretend that we have some sort of a property rights or free markets when at every turn you are you're turning around your pain astronomical gas taxes astronomical property taxes that we're talking about income tax without focusing on the part that's less than fifty percent of all the taxes you pay as a citizen\nThat how do you have property rights when the law is used to control you in Obamacare which is what Republicans now run out\nIs free nonsense health care free college that socialism has now become so interwoven with our society conservatives run to protected\nThat as you we as you watch it creep into society that's metastasized to where even good people are now fighting for bad ideas and this is what happens when you lose your fundamentals when you lose your principles when you pretend elected officials who was virtually say two different things to two different groups of people that you trust them\nIn fact the only restraints in this country should beyond that none of us the idea that they sit in these in these pretend a positions and a mess tens of millions without working a day and we call them honorable\nThis is what happens when you have a stupid fight citizen\nWhen you when you chance for control when you turn to your abuser so how do you get it back if we pretend enemies of our country that are giving money to to people who are declared themselves forever enemies like Saudi Arabia they're our friends and we stick up for them you don't have to pick between two bad you can wash your hands with 'em all\nAlright she's been waiting a long time and I want to thank her for waiting Megan thank you so much for all the not how are you\nTrying I'm Glad shine I Love your a particular brand of libertarian commentary it's really refreshing\nVery much I didn't even know what it was but I keep getting called different think I'll take 'em all\nOkay fine and the bad when I'm lying five I'll take that one too but go ahead [laughter]\nThose are the most fun okay um I don't trust or believe politicians either I mean at all\nBut I think there's more I think that what is the point your guest was making was that we have other considerations in this region decides oil I mean as as a world power I mean I'm not trying to see her in any shape or form but we have a responsibility to protect those smaller than a week\nWell Meghan you know how naive I Am not at the cost of one American Boy not at the cost of want America here's the thing not at the cost of another foreigner by by selling them weapons that they're using that you know they're attacking civilians what's happening in Yemen Megan is a war crime\nThey blew up a bus a month and a half but when you were talking about a forty kids for a school kids they're blowing up hospitals are blown up they're targeting residential area and you know what they're targeting them with\nUS military bombs what's going on here Megan talk about stand up for somebody you know we're supposed to do we're supposed to stand up for all people that want liberty\nBut not through military force but not through selling weapons to people who are using it against them but we're supposed to do that on principle we're supposed to demand liberty and freedom for the individual you know when you look back at what the country is it's not the uh dirt it's not it's not mileage it's\nNot a north and south latitude and longitude it's the ideal of freedom for the person that every human being has ... right that's what it is and\nThe ideal world around Seventeen years we've lost thousands of kids that nobody can tell us why or what it's going to stop nobody Afghanistan we just lost three guys in Afghanistan to Mays ago he just had a shooting they tried to kill a a colonel in Afghanistan again this morning what's going on\nAnd they brought two towers down in New York City\nAnd it's happened here here's here's you know I had a friend of mine we're debating this is my ... oh brought him down where where those guys from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia\nSo come on to stand for something because we are being led around like we've got a ring in our nose and it's because of we trust them around look at this guy\nOr just relies admittedly Steve ... look at him grown man dies his hair\nPitch black you look toward tickets for God's sake Democrat third generation Baker you're the guy got a trust by the way for all you people out there were two twenty Eighteen oh I could talk on my phone and see my kids face the whole night or stop where to pay that die in your hair for God's sakes you look ridiculous All right let's go to\nFrance thank you so much for calling the show how are you get I quit both see what's going on oh we lost ...\nAre you do at the ... rich called back ... hit me with Pat Pat thank you so much for calling the show\nTo yes I Know there was ... I don't know okay something about Trump come you don't have training like that I don't know\nWhat you said is we should trust the advisors around Trump than you said you\nKnow what I what I ... we trust we should trust her advisors as what I was saying I got cut advisors and I think I\nCan call you once you get any what's named the vitamins instead of say a blanket statement pellets name all\nYou want to trust Wilbur Ross who made his money\nWho made his money through buying a defunct companies and selling the product back to the government should we trust Wilbur Ross who made billions of dollars through his political connections and through his lobbying firm in the steel business and all their various industries in which you could control government do purchases and tariffs against us now is trying\nTo make it far says ... that we we do do you know we knew dealings with China and even\nThough they don't treat their people right over there are two and we don't stop dealing with the column that we in fact you say aren't\nWe do we deal with them because they are treating people better that through and he and I asked what do you mean it's an economic boom town just just look at what's happening in China China how do you measure if he will do well how do you know\nI Know because I watch the news how do I know I mean it's it's like having an argument with my Boston Terrier for God's sake or I go to Vince will you please jeeze\nBitch shot do much work on the show buddy Yeah Richard\nTrying to listen to it but one of the go ahead and happens to everybody you know the I think here's your spouse or a A R B up sort of lecturing I mean I Know you don't want to trucks Republicans either but you want to trust the Democrats\nAbsolutely not really what guns are the only way to spend the money\nI'm telling you that as you said earlier up your your abs so I'm just saying it because it's a fact and and the fact that we're complacent and we buy this much talking points that what's the last election I Am telling you that until we demand that they do we want them to do it's going to be slow loss you want to lose it all\nBut there are there are stuck with this government shutdown I shut the government and I are under her have it they're going to go or go on the lecture that they shut it down\nAnd I are on the same page that's right Vince shut down because you know what happened\nWhat started out on the Republicans are going to get to\nKnow I'm going to tell you something a traitor to my beliefs is worse than an opponent because you said you were on my team and you're stab me in the back and I'm Talking specifically to the Paul Ryan Republican or the John ... Republican you scoundrel that you know a lot of people pretend you're on your on your capital thrown out he's a lobbyist\nThere's a lobbyist K Street is John painter campaign or walk right under Clinton you know it'd be now they go to war to real money as it is yeah now they go to work real money is there a lobbyist why be the pinpoint you could be I mean why it would be the ... they go from\nFrom politicians a lobbyist and they make ten times the money and the other thing is nobody talks about the money they make now why do they all\nPosition themselves in stock stock markets there all have bigger portfolios and the best trainers on Wall street everybody hates Wall Street oh to Wall Street's bad and listen I don't like bail out Wall Street either\nBut why don't you hate the politician that is a mess some incredible amounts of money either through extortion to holding back laws and regulations or throughout right using the information to enrich themselves\nThis is a position where we're pretending there's there's different sides of it that there is a good side versus the bad side when you have had Republicans in the house the actual house to spend that money for eight consecutive years and that that has doubled\nStruggled under Republicans so the argument to Vince is I prefer an opponent to a traitor throw the trade routes or he's never going to have the right way\nAnd then when it gets terrible and ... and the socialist implodes everything the way it should be when they can't hide the lie anymore then we come back in and do things the right way because the pretend you're winning when you're really losing just makes it look stupid\nI'm Sean tops in in for Joe Walsh three one two six for two fifty six hundred I Am so excited about the gas I have coming up because Jonathan honing actually got to ask Peter Navarro appointed question and guess what Peter Navarro their kid gets what he did in there\nHe ran like a little girl because he had no answers because he's a Republican who's been controlling and deceiving the American people I Want to be up but I Want to be for a reason\nWhen for principles for lose and pretend you got shots house it in for Joe wants we'll be back after the\nNot only that we're going to make sure that there's no real restrictions and variances in different things other people have to do because we are going to make sure you come here because we want you to create jobs\nBut when you do the math what you have to get that Illinois has subsidize any pretend growth there is no real growth there is only the illusion the the a Potemkin growth that Illinois pretended has because of its fail you failed policies\nPeople who can do and they leave\nThe other people are tethered here through love and affection and family obligations and they can't leave but how does Illinois it proceed\nAnd fake the the the the pretend the illusion that it's a it's a state that's running okay they give money to targeting industries and people that's why if you're an independent taxpayer you\nWant to get your taxes lowered teasing called the right call\nCall up the right call go to a bar or go to Mike mad to get hired their law firm and you can get it done and that's the thing to remember is that failed socialism is the most corrupt of all governments because it what it does is it takes those politicians and it makes them gods and that's why they sell it\nWhen you say you can't be that all these politicians can't recognize this oh no no no no they recognize it and they like it\nThey recognize it and they want to put Mussarat it they love it because it makes them gods and it makes you slaves that's why if you read one book in your life and make it the road to serfdom by Hajek because what he warned about Seventy five years ago it was what you wake up to in the morning\nHe ... he warns you do not cook food with socialism for it is a cancer that metastasize as of which no host can survive knowing\nThat the Soviet Union not Venezuela not Chicago 'cause that's the other thing recognized we pretend there's an election going on oh really is there an election they're Seventeen version for the same free Seventeen versions of the same nonsense and then spread it out to the state you got seven foot stupid Laurel and hardy of failure\nYou got router and Pritzker ooh what's the big difference\nI the one's got a wife that's very involved the other one seems like she doesn't say much I'll go with the quiet wife\nBecause it's the same policies that same bend inspired to borrow that same nonsense not accountability and it's the same collusion and corruption because if you're sick a Democrat lobbyist than ... go take a look Nancy Kimmy is\nFive foot two or three hundred pounds of corruption all wrapped in a trench coat that's what you get because it is the most corrupt system you've ever seen because that's the only way it survives is it fake success it gives tip agreements it gives a low interest loans to special targeted\nIt here in Illinois junk bond status failure as far as the eye can see\nWhat you're doing you're choosing failure life I'm Shawn Johnson him for Joe

you fix it now here's the beauty of it it can be fixed over night overnight through really doing what threw implementing were built the country\nAnd this is just going to be a tirade rant about capitalism it's going to be a tirade rant about what his freedom and how to use ... correct it and the first thing is you recognize the failure now here in Illinois we have a particular failure\nAnd that particular failure is the astronomical spending and failure of the government\nIllinois is the is the truly the petri dish of corrupt wait till you play music so talk show for God's sakes I'm of corrupt\nPolitics because it feeds on itself and we pretended isn't there and when we send people to correct it they do with the Trojan Horse of failure Bruce Rauner did which is pretty much implement their agenda and keep the party train of corruption going and as we know when we turn on the television or the radio were inundated with commercials\nAbout how they're running as if there is the first type forget what the fifties been there for four years and what did you really do what is your main accomplishment\nAnd when you look at what they mean accomplishment as its failure\nHis may accomplishment is fair so we have a choice to make a as Illinois and now some of us can do with the smart people doing that for either move or make plans to move but other of us can't\nBecause it ironically the very policies even implemented have destroyed the biggest asset we as citizens accumulate for the most of us that's our home\nBecause they they have now a policy in Illinois where it's almost refreshing that they admit you were being taxed not on the value of your property but on how bad the state is wrong\nI mean it's it's it's absolutely mind boggling that we have candidates come on and on and we interview 'em and they say well we're gonna we're going to attach a tax increases to inflation well wait a minute you're admitting that you're going to make it grow\nYou were admitting that I Will no longer be pack on the value of my property\nBecause this is the system in place the it is twenty eight team we not only can spot hair pieces in bed day jobs that men we have the access to information that can give us per minute the price of our real estate\nThat there is no need for a bureaucracy in the middle called the ... office none zero does it need to exit\nIs that it provides with you for you options and value and the son of a guns are determined to not only take it away but to profit from your choices\nAnd pretend it's government six that's see that's the thing because Trump's tweet of tariffs money is flowing into the treasury that taxes paid by some of the people who can least afford the camp\nAnd Peter Navarro could not or really would not answer your question\nAnd it it it's hot and you know we're already seeing it and and if people say oh come on now\nIt's funny that you have to only battled Democrat because Democrats was always just said oh come on it's an extra one or two percent knew could afford that not a Republican public didn't come on it's just a little bit more you could afford that you're absolutely right it those who can least afford it\nUh the extra taxes or is or trying to pay for it and you know sure we're already seeing it in something like washing machines you know that was one of the earliest Arabs that the president goes on and poured washing machine\nI says there are up you know between Fifteen and twenty percent\nYou're talking about ... four hundred five hundred dollar I\nSaid look I your money and that's a lot of money\nLet's do the Jesse Livermore and step back and take that one example that you just pick so the washing machine goes up all who who goes to laundromat is what the poorest the people behind us around us so now when the laundry machine goes up what is the laundromat do\nIt raises its price so your literally pass through in an increase to people who are struggling minute to minute\nNot only that you may be preventing somebody who's poor from getting that new item now you force them into a laundromat\nSo just that one single item what I hate about people who are at least people around us that are telling a story this is a good policy they're ignoring the ramifications of these terrible we all know the free dissent Nineteen Thirteen anymore we know what's gonna happen yeah\nYeah I mean the end and you don't need to go to black history and Shawn let me just go back to cheat thousand to get\nYou know President Bush tried bits tried as an import tariffs then or ill and aluminum and what was what he found was that unemployment decrease unemployment slow for a period of time but they didn't stop at all and in fact there was tremendous job\nLoss and all those other ancillary a ... industries as you said and it\nIt it it comes to any like any intervention into free people's lives are there the hurting and making costs is more expensive to keep out stay out keep a free people free and stop manipulating with what we buy and and where we shop\nAnd you know what's funny is you pick that example what was Wilbur Ross doing during that time Wilbur Ross was the guy who had the aluminum had the steel he's the guy that was guaranteed profits through his connections to Bush\nRight so there's a corporate ... there was a diabolical thing nature to this this isn't patriotism to me this is a diabolical corporate ... this is where the true\nSpecial interests love these policies\nIt's American Steel what's the first thing they did after Trump or is this there are implemented terrorists they raise their prices in fact they get afford to shoot commercials now for God's sakes are you watching this Jonathan and and and why aren't the American people\nYou realize when we're talking like this you have any idea you know I'm In a tough position filling in for Joe Walsh she tells me don't run the show I got people call me up what are you so down for\nUsed or buy him a good job\nTo me when you lose your principles your ear off your addressed in a sea of deception and this is to me what's happening when good people who were conservative you're on Fox Business for God's sakes for the most part uh the guy who's show you around he supports these Sarah Varney loves these things\nYeah I mean I think there's a lack of basic knowledge on basic economics you know I mean it showing your ear or background of the financial services is that you know and they used to say oh well this song has\nLittle lo o lo o lo was that just means the right\nConditions so tariffs has kind of a nice way of of saying taxing you know it's it's it's Husted insured because she said there is so much to cheer about I mean it's a company like baseball click waiter like\nNetflix

down just call one eight hundred six nine one eighty nine Seventy nine or\nListening to the Joe Walsh program my name is Shawn Thompson filling in for Joe Walsh on a rare rare day off\nNow a lot happened if you've listened to a Joe Walsh and I filled in and one of the main things that that has happened is that Eric the red the want to be biking\nThe kid who uh I Would spring from time to time who I'm convinced Joe used the chain up in a little box when he wasn't here just judging by ... you know he was like a scared dog when you'd walk past so I Would spring him and I are I'd like to think I was in trickle in the hiring of one\nMistake Callahan slash Betty rubber I don't know if they're true or not but for Tonight Show it will be because I called her my girl and then right away Joe you know he's very competitive and all of a sudden you were his girl and it was back and forth well tonight you're my girl and I was wrong you from the Eric the red cage\nAnd I brought in misty Callahan\nFor um the syndicated our for the Joe Walsh program which is a big deal at first thing we do is they have technical difficulties not\nFor everyone like it'll come to yourself oh my\nGod all due to the ghettos and I own a shirt and the other room doesn't hit the right by well who knows how to fight with a few more times you know if he told me one minute or is it a different side I'm All right\nWell you know the only thing\nThat Sean times in my helmet park finally finally yachts and that means nothing to the people listening but the way that it started the way that I got here for those of you who are not listening as I Would pastor Joe Walsh and some people in the morning I Would call up from my car 'cause I'm a very opinionated capitalist\nAnd I'm a very frustrated um citizen of America who believes that liberty should be the foremost not party affiliation I've been rejecting tribalism really since ... after Reagan since I was told that the Bush senior was doing the right thing when I recognized him with his compassionate conservative\nFraud that he was I never liked any of his policies I never liked any of the Saudi Arabia\nNonsense which I Believe those chickens are coming home to roost as we speak I didn't like the collusion with some different Middle Eastern affiliates against certain other Middle Eastern uh fleets not that I was picking winners or losers but I didn't like his whole agenda foreign policy I didn't like his economic corporate to some\nBig bank friendly and look at what's happened so I Would say either ahead of my time or I'm just crazy enough to be right it's all how you look at it [laughter] um so I befriended a couple I I worked at a job where I never listen to radio never wants to listen to talk radio\nI was tired from that changed careers you know five and I started listening to talk radio and um\nI call up at the time Joe Walsh was not even a in in the news at the time he was like myself are frustrated citizen just before he became a congressman\nCall up some talk radio here in the Chicago land area and I would argue with the host\nAnd now here I Am filling in for that for the and here you are it's like a marriage every once in a while a well placed argument can really spicy things up a little bit amen to that and that's what\nThis is not the main reason that dumb hosts kind of took my calls is because I wasn't just arguing and rage in just a a things I wanted to happen I was trained as a as we all do is to base our opinion in fundamentals and I think that is what's crucially important important now my other career\nWas that was a commodity trader mhm and it wasn't I was I don't know if it's three after my name or of Vienna one I'm not a blue blood like Pritzker who runs I didn't come from any money at lived on top of a garage I'd just like to make money I started out as a runner and I had to learn what made markets move\nSo when people used to tell me what college did you go I said well I went to the Chicago mercantile exchange that was the greatest college in the world and I'm like the colleges of today you got paid to be there and the better you were the more you got paid\nSo uh I liked the idea that you know capitalism and the I ... it really ties in to American liberty\nAnd steeped in property rights and its steeped in the fact that you as an as a citizen or not bound by legacy of who you're born to but you're bound by your own principles your own fundamentals your own ideology and I think this is crucially Americanism\nAnd um that's how I base my opinions\nOn things and um one thing when you have that fundamental belief of liberty and capitalism and property rights you tend to reject with allies that politicians sell you because if it's one thing we can all agree on whether you consider yourself a Democrat or Republican Trump being whatever you consider yourself\nYou can agree that even when you like them they're lying to you\nAnd it is through this that I'm hoping we can have a common ground to do with America is supposed to be which is to put the restraints on politicians\nInstead of allowing politicians to put restraints on citizens now whether they do they do this through taxes they do this through a there are protesting virtue of a social engineering program or they do this for weaponized law\nAnd regulations which are hidden laws are giving bureaucrats the power to seize our property I think it is important that we as citizens recognize this discuss these talking points dissect them and reject them\nAnd then to that and that's the moral of the story and to prove my point\nI give you today's Republican and today's Republican Nazi it's me and I'll tell you missed the one we're talking primarily to Republicans yeah but there's one thing you can't hide from and that's the reality of our history and if you go back through history and you look at who explodes our national debt\nWhich is the most pervasive undermining current against freedom there ever was it's Republicans whether it's the Obama Republicans who complained about how much money Obama we're spending but we gave them the house ... which is the Congress two years after we won\nSo in two thousand and ten we central Walsh there are very proud of that right Tea Party people from around the country we got up and we sent guys like Joe Walsh we're speaking about freedom and restraint on government of capitalism we said you go do your job you're a citizen governor we want you to be part of the government and we sent them there and all but a handful\nStabbed us in the back and it's undeniable when you look at the explosion of spending after two thousand and ten to the present day these are the Republicans at that\nAnd it's absolutely disgusting\nSo I like see here's the thing I like some of the Trump stuff mhm put I reject the part where it's government spending or hit in government spending now one thing I like about him is he'll he cut bureaucracy mhm let's give this guy credit\nWhere credit's even during something about like eight hundred somebody regulations he's a congressman and then the ...\nAnd and for that would have been great Mm but I call them two steps forward army two steps backward in one step forward because that's great when you do that stuff but when you add a tariff Mm\nThe greater regulation in the world\nBecause it it is it is steering the American people you're preventing them from opportunity in value and the problem is we tell ... politicians your leaders and I think they're not supposed to be\nSeeing the way if you read the founding documents they're supposed to be followers they're not supposed to be leaders how did this happen to me where is the jujitsu of my freedom\nBecause the reality is they're supposed to be represented ... we live in a republic or when you hear these people it's a democracy no no no because I'm guaranteed I Will not be a victim of the tyranny of the majority\nThat the smallest minority is what this country's built around the individual mhm and in order for that to be honored it has to be we have to be a republic\nSo sometimes a politician said when's the last time this happened this is a great question for I okay I don't know if I'll ever get to talk to a politician gonna have to show when is the last time a politician wanted\nTo vote one way for his own opinion but for the betterment of his citizens\nOf the person he supposed to represent he voted it another way one of the last time that happened\nAnd I don't know when they can ... who can you think uh one politician that said that I Can't\nThink of one however I can think of probably several that would say that they vote in the interests of the uh the greater majority like the interest of the people and they're you know\nAnd their constituents but really they\nDon't you know when they when they said it is is now election I just wanted to frauds combat\nFather's girlfriend in Washington all the bar tabs go down in Washington they come home they rekindle with their old lady that they abandoned back in their home states and they uh they come back and tell us how\nYou know they just they try their best they fought for us I Know they didn't do what we want them to do what they really really try and we go through this cycle of pretend conservatism every two years and all but a small minority are actually those people that govern the way they run out\nAnd one thing that I've noticed in this change and we'll get back to this after the break one thing I've noticed in the changes that Republicans have now sees upon the\nI'm going to make sure you have affordable health care the biggest joke of tyranny the biggest success of the tyrant is Obamacare socialized medicine which affects each and every one of us from cradle to grave they got us and the reality is they're not letting us go\nAnd what you're seeing is you're seeing a paradox or a dime shift where Republicans now are are chanting against freedom in choice of healthcare they're guaranteeing we're going to make sure that it's just like Obamacare which you can call it something else and what happens when that happens is that you and me lose\nAnd I don't see are hard pressed to pay attention ladies and gentlemen in your own home states pay attention to the to the commercials they're running on the same thing Obama\nPreached when he pass Obamacare and that's when we all his shots confident for Joe Walsh we'll be back after these must [noise]\n\nI Lived in a community called models parking lot mhm and Lois Park Illinois was was one of the first towns where I'm at that time illegal\nAliens Mexicans in particular case there was a small community of Mexicans and they were welcome there and we welcome them there for the most part and they came but one of the things that we saw happen was that all of our documents started to have to be printed\nIn Spanish mhm and it was a tremendous cost of this little community and we saw all of the things exploding the cost of schools the cost of healthcare but one of the things I recognized as a young kid\nIs well that shouldn't exist anyway so I don't want to use immigration as an excuse to protect American failed socialism there shouldn't be public school\nI'm Sorry can I Do a lot of people out there benefit but it shouldn't exist your neighbors shouldn't pay for your kid to go to school and if you believe in freedom any believing liberty you would have rejected it at a premise because it's also hard to argue while your neighbor shouldn't pay for your health care we should pay for your kid's school\nAnd I would just interject by thing especially these days you know going back to what you're saying earlier about socialism being taught\nWhere do you think these kids are getting these ideas are getting tight like that you know capitalism is right there was just a recent article coming out from teen vogue magazine talking about the end world poverty you need to Andy capitalism stuff is being taught\nIn school which is ... and you know in these teen magazines apparently now I'm so when if I ever have kids do I want to send them to a public school where they're just going to be indoctrinated with basically socialism nonsense\nSo let me tell you why do we have kids I have two teenagers ... my wife and I was I'm a regular guy real estate broker type of food on the table I own a little cigars are but I Am a real estate but was hurt some types of sometimes I'm leaning most we have never never taken our kids and put them in a public system of an ... we pay that extra money you wonder if some I complain about\nAn average it some it when they went to grade school was like seven thousand a year and a lot of money yeah but you want to know something to public school waste twice that\nBecause they don't waste their money waste our money it's always easier to spend somebody else's money than yourself if you have kids I got news for you out there you have an obligation to that kid said you're old neighbor already raised his case he has nothing to your kid but let's not use laws a weapon to extort them\nUm and that's the problem so when you argue about immigration do it on an intelligent level where you're not arguing to protect American failed socialism your argument on principles that when you really dissect\nIt should be a principled American my name is Shawn Johnson in ...\n[noise]\nAre you\nReady to throw up free to Joe Walsh program Congressman Joe ...
