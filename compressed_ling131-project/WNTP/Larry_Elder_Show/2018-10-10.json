fundamentally that was the most important reason why I voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton I Can't stand Hilary clinton I think she's dishonest I think she's one of the most corrupt politicians in modern times\nBut Republicans and conservatives are like apoplectic today about something Hillary Clinton said in an interview she was over at\nOxford in England she sat down with Christiana I'm\nI'm

keep Hillary Clinton out there but I\nI I Need to differ with my Republican and conservative colleagues\nWho think that Hillary Clinton went really over the line with something she said in this interview this morning she was talking about the Republican Party both parties are both parties don't get along how divided we are\nHow on civil we our with each other and then Hillary Clinton said this uh Devon give me Clinton number one\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the Senate that twin civility can start again\nYou cannot be civil with a political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for Hillary this morning you can't be civil man with the Republicans they're trying to destroy us she says it can't be civil man nope just got a pound of just got to go to war can't be civil camping nice can't be respectful\nAnd even the media class\nWent for a horrible thing to say what a horrible thing to say and so many Republicans and conservatives today\nA gas that what she said funded by what she said there's Hillary Clinton basically saying you know what a it's open warfare with the other party don't even try to be civil\nI gotta tell ya I gotta tell ya I find that pretty comical nice to hear me out guys hear me out I don't like Hillary but when I hear people on our side when I hear Republicans\nAnd conservatives can mean Hillary Clinton for ... and really what it would include Hillary Clinton just recommend Democrats do there are banned in civility that's what she said\nA band in all civility all he who enter hear\n\nRepublicans and conservatives are offended by that they took her to task for that today\n\nCome on now seriously seriously you're going to get on Hillary Clinton\n\nFor telling Democrats not to be civil\n\nWhen you've got Donald Trump in the White House\nWho let's be real if you want to be honest are you ready to be honest or not\nWrite a Trump's got a lot of strength she's got a lot of flaws baby but a\nCivility is not something he leads us how 'bout that I'm trying to be diplomatic writes Donald Trump did not make a name for himself being civil Donald Trump did not get elected president he didn't win that Dan gum or\nA nomination and then when the general election bean civil\n\nDonald Trump doesn't believe in civility\nSo all you ... if there is any real if there's any Trump supporter who's offended that Hillary Clinton says no more no mosque baby can we be civil and and you support Trump\nAnd if you're honest and I know it's hard to be honest but you know Trump's not a civil guy that's not what he does that's not what he leads with man he leads within solves he leads with punching upside the head Donald Trump has no interest in civility\nAnd most of us most Trump supporters have been just fine with it\nIn fact I'd argue it's a key to his success\nI just don't want you complaining about Hillary saying the same thing there's plenty to get angry about with Hillary\n\nNot this let me go to Rick K Rick\nHey Joe how are you not me I Love it when she was on radio and TV I Love every single breath she take ap huddle along with it now says our president gotta like ah almost\nTwo years eight and twenty miles say\nOkay well for those who are learning Spanish today's word of the day is nacho it's twenty four months and she still nacho president every every time she opens her mouth it just gets it it lets us know what they're doing and what they're really all about\nI'm with you all the way my friend I'm Rick I'm with you all the way I agree whole heartedly\nLet me go to Mike Hey Mike\nJoel number one fan body listen here's the deal\nTrump is a slap in the back of the head not in the face of the American people troubled everybody up at the look what's going on around you\nBut that being said it will agree on a lot of things just read something that like your ... ... feet the part that gets saying Democrats are lying\nAt any time someone gets to the corner that life is going to spend anything they got but say back on you and there'll be their fault but they're in that argument or in the first place\nA lame at and I'll hang up or it might be great call thank you brother I got nothing to say I agree with everything you just said I agree with everything you just said I Want to say this though Hillary Clinton's getting a lot of crap today for saying that we need to get rid of civility\nIn our politics I'm Sorry I got no problem with that that's what Trump is done for two years if you got a problem with it then you should have a problem with Trump that being civil I got no problem with anybody being not civil we are a divided nation we are a nation at war\nOr we are in an ideological war here we are having a fight over the very\nEssence of what it means to be America okay things are going to get ugly things are going to get violent things are going to get messy\nWe're not going to be civil for probably some time\nI don't want it to sound like I'm defending Hillary I'm not I'm Glad she's speaking I think he can rip her for a lot like when she talks about how Republicans went after her when she defended or has been a rapist right that that's all good that's all fine\nWith this one is not that was silly hey I'm Joe Walsh don't going\nAll\nWell hey Jason you make a great point and I agree with a lot of that it's kind of what we wanted we wanted and on civil jerk doesn't it make sense Jason but doesn't make sense that the Democrats like Hillary saw that\nAnd now they're saying you know what to beat Trump weren't going to need another civil SOB is well doesn't that kind of make what\nSoda ... I I never looked at it like that before that's interesting\nMaybe maybe they learn Jason I really appreciate man could call call again I I look at this and I think the Democrats are just learning from Trump\nLook guys don't don't life is too short just be honest\nDonald Trump is in uncivil SOB you know that even dose of you out there that worship him you know that\nWell he's been pretty damn successful so you did that's all Hillary said you're the Democrats what's what is she saying what is she telling her fellow Democrats you know what done or done being nice the only way Democrats can win is if we have our own on civil SOB\nThat's all she said I got no problem with it I don't like Hillary spaghetti with that\nAnd and you shouldn't either\nBut don't tell anybody that I kinda sorta complimented Hillary 'cause I don't think I did [noise] I don't think I did I'm Joe Walsh them go [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt's time to check the mosh freedom voicemail when you're saying about you

conclusion and make a recommendation which they're not supposed to do\nBut remember Comey did that with the electorate that she was going to go with her conclusion and the recommendation\nSo that same thing is probably what they have up there ... or ... especially ... like the guy who got appointed for the Russian investigation if he was an anti Trump ... they can an anti Trump guy they know that

tired of me you're tired of me already aren't ya there's a blue wave calming wake up Republicans\nI've been on this kick a pretty much ever since the president got elected\nOn this kick because I Do not want us to lose the house or the Senate this November that's why I'm On this kick that's why for the past year and a half\nI've been talking about the blue wave that's why for the past year and a half I've been talking about how angry pissed off and fired up Democrats are\nBecause I'm trying in my own little way that's all I'm doing in my own\nWay I'm trying to wake up our ... period that's all I'm doing\nI voted for this president I'm Glad he won a I I I I wanted the disruption I wanted a lot of what he's brought\n'em but I've watched that ever since Donald Trump raised his right hand and was sworn in and became the Ford or the president United States [noise] I've seen [noise]\nOn the other side [noise] something pretty dramatic happening I've seen the other side fired up [noise]\nSeen our side since two thousand and ten right when our side was angry and fired up because Obama was president and they shoved Obamacare down our throats\nAnd that kind of anger that kind of fired up nests or help get guys like me elected in gave a the Republicans the house of representatives [noise]\nAnd I've watched over the course of the last year and a half in every single special election or the Democrat vote way way way up the Republican vote just kind of hand\nAnd then I've noticed in all of the primaries the Democrat vote is up over Ninety percent\nFrom the last ... turn twenty fourteen Republican boat up about twenty percent Democrat vote up over Ninety percent this primary season\nAnd I'm thinking to myself I Know\nBecause I recognize that there's something going on I'm thinking to myself look I get it the other side's angry they're out of power I get it right our guys in the White House they're angry we know what that feels like don't we right\nWhen I went when their guy was in the White House when Obama was in the White House remember how angry we were remember how angry you were when Obama was in the White House rights member that anger that angers an incredible thing do you remember what that anger caused you to do\nRight that anger you go back to two thousand and ten you go back to after Obama got elected two thousand and ten two thousand and fourteen we pay take back the Senate you remember what that anger caused our side do we made great strides\nWe made great gains and in fact I Would argue that anger with where America's that man that that came out\nJust enough barely enough but it came out in twenty sixteen and it helped get Trump elected\n\nSo by a fellow Republicans and conservatives\nDon't pooh pooh anger don't dismiss anger anger worked for us anger against Obama works for us anger against the elites the system works for us in twenty sixteen\nAnd what I'm trying to impress upon everybody on my side is our side is\nThe other side has that anger now plain and simple\nThe other side has that anger now and and that's a fact okay that's just a fact what's gonna come of it well the Democrats are going to make gains in the house especially is probably not who knows\nWhat to say that the Democrats are going to pick up seats in the house is the anger enough to give them the house don't know\nBut then this goes to why I talk about the blue wave so much\nBecause if our side doesn't rise up to meet the anger the Democrats anger will then yes most certainly the Democrats will take back the house of representatives\nOf that I have no doubt\n[noise] that's why my siren that's why I might call every week or two\nThe Democrats are coming the Democrats are\nComing to wake up grab your friends grab your family get out

didn't have to hear about it I Wish I didn't have to remind us all about it I get it I get that do most of you are sick and tired of hearing about the blue wave I Do believe most viewed deep deep down no there's something to what\n\nI Believe that deep down you sort of know\nThat the other side has that been gift this year that gift of anger\nAnd it's got you're concerned and ... it's got you're worried to a degree and you should be and\nI Would just say that they don't the anger is not exclusive to them they don't have to be the only ones who are angry the Democrats\nMean angers are great motivation I I think if if Brett Kavanaugh had gone down if he had the pool his nomination or he was voted down\nBelieve that would have let the anger fuse in most of us\n\nThat would have been okay All right now\nYeah\nMy worry is and I'm so glad Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court\nYou know that\nWhat my worry is okay [laughter] just the latest example of we won\nWe won that battle we got our guy on the Supreme Court so then the day or two or three later the Democrats they lost that battle\nAnd they're really angry about it [laughter] [noise] and it's added to the anger they already had\nIn our side why get angry we won Kevin all one\n[noise]\nAh\nYou know rejoicing celebrating is not celebration is not the same motivation that anger is [noise] and angers behind this blue wave don't ever\nThat [noise] you're\nAnd it's not even close so I look at that\nAnd I look at the Democrats who are out there working pounding the pavement knocking on doors and making phone calls I see a lot of that all over the country and it reminds me of what we did in twenty ten\nWhen people on our side the Tea Party we were knocking on doors and making phone fault calls for candidates and we've

[noise]\nSurely to wake our side uh\nWe we got\nWe got real concerns and if our side doesn't wake up that we're going to be in trouble in twenty eight days if we don't wake up\nSo you are listening to me the the answer simple wake up and tell your friends to wake up until your family members to wake up\nFor\nAnd get people out there pounding the pavement get people out there knocking on doors get people out there writing checks again doesn't have to be big ... can be small checks [noise] this is what the Democrats are doing that she was brilliant\nOr the Senate and house candidates are being

in this in this country the voters though they know that that's that's a non nothing burger and so I'm going to continue going forward just speaking the truth uh but I'm not going to be derailed by these fake controversies now here's an article by ...\nMatthew Chapman don't know who he is headlined GOP candidate wrote a book arguing the founding fathers were right not to abolish slavery\nAnd he's talking about Rhonda Santa's around a standard wrote a book called dreams from our founding fathers first principles in the age of Obama and that's a take off from Obama's book brings for my father\nQuote one of the most disturbing claims he made in the book was that Thurgood Marshall the first African American Supreme Court justice was wrong to suggest the founding fathers failure to abolish slavery in the constitution was a fundamental flaw\nIf the standard is simply left it at tolerating slavery was a central to get the southern states on board she might have had a point but the claim that the constitution somehow pre ordained at the end of slavery F written is pure whitewashing given that it took a bloody civil war\nTo do so\nAnd he talks about the three this deal that was made between the north and the south\nHow reprehensible that deal was another person who appears to be pretty ignorant about history here's an article by Walter Williams called slavery quote\nAt the time of the Seventeen eighty seven\nConstitutional convention slaves were about forty percent of the population of some southern colonies he talks about how the southerners want it to ... count each late as one person in order to increase their representation in the north because they want it to limit the power of a slave holding ... states\nWanted them not to count them at all so they agreed on telling them three this as a compromise\nQuote many criticize writes Walter Williams this compromise as proof of racism which is what this guy said about rounded Sanders [noise] my\nQuestion to these grossly uninformed critics is whether they would have found it more preferable for slaves to be counted as whole person's slave candidates whole person would have given slave holding southern states much more political power or which critics of the founders prefer that the northern delegates not compromise and\nNot allow slaves to be counted at all if they did it is likely that the constitution would not have been ratified that's the question emerges whether blacks would have been better off with northern states haven't gone there a way in southern states haven't gone there's resulting in no U.S Constitution and no union\nAnd then walked Williams quote Patrick Henry who set of this brief is compromise quote as much as I deplore slavery I see that prudent forbids its abolition into quote\nOne of the delegates Jane will streams Wilson said this about the compromise they laid the foundation for vanishing slavery out of this country and of quote\nThere's also a website maintained by the federal government call constitution Centre dot org\nAnd talks about the three fifty you quote in truth it was a political deal that many delicate felt was essential to preserving the union told\nMadison was a slave owner he felt deeply conflicted about slavery\nBut he was a strong advocate of the constitution so we felt\nObligated to defend even the three this rule close quote what this guy criticizing Rhonda status is saying is that the Sanders was wrong when you said that freaks us compromise was essential a and that the states have been set for the eventual abolition of slavery\nThis guy is not true and therefore Rhonda status must apparently be racist oh my goodness\nRhonda status has called out the double standard all these anti Semite that are surrounding his uh
