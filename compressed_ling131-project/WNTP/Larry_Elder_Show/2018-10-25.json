can down what happened today\nI've got to believe I Want to believe that Republican Democrat conservative liberal independent whatever the heck you are\nI've got to believe that we all condemn this

Eric Holder and did not get to Maxine Waters that's that's the good news\n\nBut you talk about an act of evil you talk about an act of political chair and that's what this was today don't hide don't hide behind that and don't call it anything else what happened today this looks to be like a coordinate coordinated act of domestic political terrorism\n\n[noise] that I Want to believe as we get into this this evening and as we talk about what happened\nToday\nAgain I'm going to want to believe that we all\nWill condemn what happened today\nBefore we go back into our political corners Thirteen Days from the mid term election\n\nAgain this is one of this was one of those days where everything just stopped\n\nEverything just stopped and paused in one after another ...\nNews came in\nA homemade bomb sent to the upstate New York home bill and Hillary\nClinton and then Obama to\nA homemade bomb sent to the Washington addressed to the Washington DC home of Iraq and Michelle Obama\n\nAnd then in another within another twenty twenty five minutes a whole may or the entire Time Warner building in New York City was evacuated the exact same home made explosive device found in the offices of CNN\nAddressed to former CIA director John Brennan by the way these three a homemade explosive devices mailed it to these three individuals are all in one day after the exact\nSame home made device explosive device was sent to the home of George Soros\nAnd then reports some other ... suspicious packages and then report solve the same homemade explosive device sent to Eric Holder and then a report of the exact same\nA homemade explosive device sent to the office of the congressional office of\nCongresswoman Maxine Waters\nAnd as we come on the air this evening the authorities have made clear\nThat all of the devices were identical the one cent to Soros in Hillary and Obama and CNN appear to be sent by the same individual or individuals\nCount Eric Holder's a is Eric Holder\nIn that as well authorities said the exact same device that were sent to everybody else was sent to Eric Holder a Maxine Waters as well authorities also reporting that are these were rather sophisticated uh explosive devices\nMay not have been mailed or sent in the most a sophisticated fashion but the devices themselves the authorities are saying we're sophisticated in nature not done by some amateur\nAnd we'll talk about this whole night this crap Scott to end this violence has got to end but it won't it won't on both sides it won't\nAnd we'll talk this evening about the reaction right to this who's to blame right I mean in a nanosecond immediately ... without any facts you immediately at people out in the right saying Hey Joe false flag operation\nAnd this was done by Democrats and liberals to make it look like somebody on the right did it and ... in a nanosecond you had people on the left blaming Trump specifically laying the blame for homemade pipe bombs at the feet of Donald Trump\nBefore anybody knew anything before any facts were out there you had disgusting idiots on both sides trying to score they're cheap political points so maybe I Am naive\nTo when I think that the country writ large the country all of us at least on this we can agree\nIt's wrong for George Soros to get a bomb in his mail\nIt's wrong for it's it's just plain wrong for Bill and Hillary Clinton to get a whole made bomb a pipe bomb in their mailbox\nThat's just wrong it's wrong for somebody to send a live homemade bomb into the CNN mail room that's just wrong\nGuy hope and before Tonight Show is over I Hope that I can believe and know\nAnd realize that at least on that we're unified that what happened today is wrong this growing political violence\nThat we've seen now for a few years that has gotten worse the last couple of years uh\nIt's wrong on both sides it's wrong\n[noise] I'm not saying it's going to end because I don't think it is [noise] but it's [noise]\n\n\nAnd tell us all the lower the temperature tell us all look guys I Know we're Thirteen Days from a big important election and we're all into it and we're all trying to rally our sides and get our voters out\nBut what

we're better than this\n\nGod Bless America I I just think the country would be much better served\nIf instead of going to Wisconsin in a big old arena and getting all political and wound up like he does not tonight\n\nThe president of the whole country tonight what happened today wasn't good uh and it could have been a lot worse and I'm going to believe in imagine that there are Americans out

choose only the other side\nOf having whack jobs ... only the other side would have somebody Joe who would do something like this I'm Sorry I didn't know it was those rules aren't any where\nPeople on the right and people on the left are fully capable of doing what was done today and they've done before what was done today people on the right and on the left are perfectly capable of committing violence what I\nMean almost weekly examples in front of us August or a man was arrested for a threatening or ... or the life of Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy the Republican House leaders\nAre just last week some nut job on the right was arrested for threatening senators who voted against Brett Kavanaugh in April somebody was arrested for threatening to kill Maxine Waters\n... what a month ago

I'm picking a few of 'em but this has been\nPretty much in unison a song on the left today\nWe are not saying Trump causes bomb threats we are saying that his rhetoric is unlike any of his

that\nUm\nI think about three years ago maybe for\nA and I immediately went on Twitter and I immediately went on the radio when those five Dallas cops were killed by a black lives matter cop hate or and I immediately went on Twitter and I went on and on Facebook and probably on the radio and I blamed Obama\nI said I said President Obama you've got blood on your hands\nFor for six years you have not stood by our cops for six years you said cops are to blame for six years you said cops are the problem for six years uh uh you you said cops need to be trained for six years you've said capture racist\nYou've got blood on your hands that somebody was listening to you and they went out and they shot and killed five Dallas police officers\nThat got in trouble for that\nUh and I got a bunch of threats for that and I went into hiding for a little bit but I'm thinking about what I said\nA few years ago\nWhen I placed blame for the deaths of police officers at the feed a Brock Obama I Believe that and I believe now Brock Obama is no friend of our men and women and blue I still believe that\nI believed then and I believe now ... do it with our cops whenever there was a cop shooting he always blamed the cop and I believe that and I believe now that Iraq Obama contributed to a climate\nThat enabled Haiti nine cops but I said a few years ago that Iraq Obama had blood on his hands and he had some responsibility for the deaths of those five Dallas police officers and I'm thinking to myself that I I ... that I I don't believe that's true\nThat's probably one I'd like back\nBecause if I'm consistent right like like broccoli Obama a spoke harshly about our cops and then somebody in Dallas goes out and shoots a and kills five cops if I'm going to blame Obama for that well you got Donald Trump\nOr calling CNN the enemy of the people and hitting on CNN if somebody goes out and shoot somebody who works at CNN some journalists because Donald Trump says the media is the enemy of the people if I'm consistent\nThen don't I have to blame Trump if if it turns out that some madman here went after all of these people who some madman who's a Trump supporter\nAnd he went after all these people who are Trump critics if I'm consistent\nJust like I blamed by Obama for the cap shootings well then I Would have to blame Trump partly for what happened today but I don't because I Believe at the end of the day the person to blame for what happened today is the person behind these homemade bombs and yeah\nI Will criticize until the cows come home or Obama's rhetoric about our cops but I was wrong when I blamed literally blamed Obama for that and guys shooting those Dallas cops the guy to blame for shooting those Dallas cops is the guy who pulled the trigger\nI Can't blame yet does Donald Trump need the coolest rhetoric yeah\nDonald Trump need to clean up his vocabulary little bit yeah does Donald Trump need to dial down the temperature a little bit yeah does Donald Trump need to try to do just a little bit better job trying to unify us a little bit yeah sure but it's Donald Trump it all the blame for what some mad man did today\nHell no hell no we got to be really careful about this just like we got to be careful about our language\nAnd the public arena and we all do myself included the members of the media we got to be careful blaming politicians and people in the media and you know that guy that shot up the uh the baseball the Republican baseball players last year he was being burned\nSanders fan you know why that mad man shot ... and the others last year because he thought Republicans favor the rich he was a big crazy Bernie's fan\nYou're going to blame Bernie Sanders for what the heck I did on that baseball field of course not\nOf course not if you do if you blame Obama for that Mad Men shooting the cops a few years ago if you blame Trump for what this bomber did today if you blame Bernie Sanders for what that Bernie fan did on the baseball field last year\nWell oh my gosh you got problems in a free country in a free society because Bernie Sanders has a right generally to say what he believes Donald Trump has a right to say what he believes Brock Obama has a right to say what he believes\nYou can't rule blaming these people for the asks the evil acts the sick acts that individuals do\nTo me that's a step you can't take I took a few years ago with Obama and I went too far you can blame Trump\nFor contributing to an environment where\nMan we are like politically man we're we're in each other's face yeah you can blame Trump for some of that you can blame me for some of that you can blame blame Nancy Pelosi for some of that sure sure sure I get all of that sure we we live in an ugly political climate right now sure\nBut then some mad crazy man does something steps over the edge and kill somebody you can't blame pillows seawall shirt Trump's for that\nWho's to blame for what happened today I'm Joe Walsh\nFalls\nYou know it's going to make you think that all of them or something would well fed [laughter] [noise] [noise] well they do the Democrats in the media that cause a lot of the problems or you know I'm sure ... corrupt as angry\nOr you know but I'm everything goes through or two years now or a little longer\nI don't blame them one bit\nAnd Dave thanks um\nThe ...\nThe bomb that was at CNN it was reported to be a alive device it did not go off it could\nIt's gone off um the other devices\nIs the one got to George Soros his residence\nOr the again the the the one to Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and Brock Obama may\nYou know they they don't Brock Obama doesn't go out and get his mail every day uh they they they go somewhere else where they're screened a first and that's where these devices were found\nOr just to kind of be technical on that point\nUm look we live in a divided country right now the rhetoric is heated right now I think it's going to get more heated right now um and I think this is just the road we're on a I think it's imperative that we all condemn violence or as much as we can\nI'm Joe Walsh\n\n[noise] it's time to check the more freedom voicemail when you're saying

com slash\nListen eight five five six for two fifty six hundred that's our number eight five five six for two fifty six\nHundred um we are\nThirteen Days out now Thirteen Days out from the midterms\nThirteen Days out from these elections and the people who are experts do care about the people who are experts [laughter] well the experts say uh\nThe Republicans will hold the United States Senate and the experts believe that the Democrats will uh just barely take control of the Illinois house excuse me the Illinois\nHouse to the house of representatives the United States House so that's kind of the expert out of the the expert opinion out there Republicans hold the Senate Democrats take the house\n\nI I Know you don't pull over these things you should and you have a life thank God you have a wife dog gunner you have a wife I'm Glad for you you have\nA life a book but part of my job is to pour over this stuff [noise] fan as I have pored over this stuff the last few weeks I think yeah I I\nThink it's almost impossible nothing's impossible but it's almost impossible for the Democrats to take the Senate\nUm it's the worst map for Democrats in the Hundred Years' war do I mean by that I mean that\n\nMost of the seats up for a reelection are all Democrats seats many more Democrats are running this year than Republicans in the Senate and the vast majority of those Democrats are running in red states\nStates that Trump won Montana North Dakota Indiana West Virginia\nOr even Florida um show the battle in the Senate is being fought on Republican turf so barring Texas barring a\n... a blue ... right I mean\nThe charts Democrat here\nWe ain't never seen barring that\nI\nI think it's pretty safe to say the Republicans will keep the Senate they might even pick up her seat or two\nThe house of representatives that's a different story it's a whole different story\nAnd it's being played on a different battle field\n'em you you've got you've got most of these house seats means fought in suburbs suburban areas or where Trump's numbers are not as strong\nA member of the Democrats only need a net what twenty three seats there are sixty some seats that are up for grabs\n\nA I often say that when I got elected in twenty ten and the Republicans took control of the house\nWe one sixty two seats in that Tea Party red wave viewer of twenty ten\nWe one sixty two seats\nAre that's going to happen this year [noise] [laughter] ... even if there is the biggest blues tsunami wave ever the [noise] the map the congressional map is much more gerrymandered\nAnd and Republicans\nThese past eight years controlled\nMany more governorships and many more state legislatures\nThey've drawn favorable maps right you know every ten years we do the census and then we draw the new districts well when we did that in a in the twenty tan\nGoing into effect in twenty twelve um Republicans do some really nice district so the the map is more gerrymandered than it was for Republicans nationwide than it was in twenty\nTen and by the way\nI'm a I'm a I'm a ... I'm a conservative I'm a Tea Party conservative or the way that we gerrymandered these districts sucks [noise]\nRepublican Democrat in control doesn't matter\nThe way that we draw these districts who's horrible [noise]\nUm partisans in charge like I come from the state of Illinois\nThe Democrats run the state of Illinois\nShow the Democrats get to draw you know I may get to draw the districts to eight years ago they drew the districts and they pretty much true me out of a district\nIn other states that Republicans control they got the pen they get to draw these districts\nLike any of that I don't believe in any of that either I don't think that\nPoliticians I don't think that it should be left up to politicians\n\nTo draw these districts [noise]\nAnd I know most of you agree with me even if you're a partisan Republican or a person Democrat I Know most you believe ... agree with me because the polling shows most to the American people\nOr that this redistricting nonsense these ugly convoluted gerrymandered districts uh this gerrymandering that goes on we gotta we gotta stop it there's got to be a better way we got to get this process on their hands politicians\nSome sort of non partisan or bipartisan process now there are some states like Iowa or that and do it different and they've got like a commission or\nA bipartisan commission that draws the districts or\nA nonpartisan commission\nAre ways you can do it but there are ways you can do it you can use a computer I mean other states are exploring other ways of drawing these districts the point is the way we're doing it now\n[noise]\nLeaving it up to politicians to decide who your congressman is gonna be cool your\nState representative is going to be because remember they draw the state legislative districts as well\nThey draw the federal and they draw the state every year and in most states it is politicians doing this map drawn\n\nTo state by state thing there are movements within each state to take this power away from the politicians\n[noise]\nWith a long time coming now\nAnd I don't expect great changes eight five five six for two fifty six hundred but be that as it may ah\nThere were many more states back in twenty ten or who were under Republican control and our under Republican control right now so those Republican\nGovernors and Republican lawmakers or drew some pretty damn safe Republican districts there by making it much more difficult\nFor say the Democrats to flip like sixty two seats remembered though the Democrats only need to flip twenty three twenty three seats met twenty three\nTo take back control of the house\nMost experts believe they're on their way to doing that not\nYou know maybe they'll net thirty seats maybe a building that thirty five seats most of the estimates I've seen are right in there anywhere from thirty to thirty seven seats\nBut either way it's control [noise] not a done deal not for sure thing but it's looking like [noise]\nYou're\nThey make enough gains to take over the house that is on certain\nThey got a lot of stars lined up to help him\nBut it ain't a done deal yet it's not a done deal by any means a lot of seats that the Democrats have to win\nAre right now seats held by Republicans are in many in like suburban districts and these Republicans are putting up really good strong fights\nAnd these races are like\nA lot of 'em are within the margin of error [noise]\nSo you see it I mean it's really it's really really close final point though on control I'll get to that right now um\nIf the Democrats take over the house life's gonna change pretty dramatically\nYou're giving power to the Democrats\nYou're giving subpoena power to the Democrats\nThe Democrats will try to investigate President Trump out of existence\n\nDon't know you know for sure whether they'll move to impeach him\nBut they will most certainly try to investigate\nInch of him and that's what the next two years will turn out to be\nYou know putting aside just putting aside the fact that the Democrats\nWill stop\nTrump's agenda\nOr ... ... many pieces of which are our agenda building the wall getting tough on the border tax cuts for Americans\nOr the Democrats will stop all of that\nBut they don't want to stop there they're really intent on see when you control the house you control everything\nYou control every committee you have subpoena power you control Benny bill that's going to be brought to the floor to be voted on that sure that the party in charge controls that\nEight five five six for two fifty six
