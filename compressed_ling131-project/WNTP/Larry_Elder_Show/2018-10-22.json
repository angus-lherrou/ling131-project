this is our American story and we love to talk about movies on this show and then this next door you're about to a year from two guys who loved a movie so much when they were kids\nThat they recreate the movie in their own backyard and on an epic level IRS Jesse with the story\nIt all started in Nineteen eighty one was Steven Spielberg's raiders of the Lost Ark the first of the Indiana Jones series starring Harrison\nFord was that your top grossing film and one of the biggest box office earners of all time upwards of three hundred and Ninety million dollars in sales but for whatever reason very following year\nSmall town of ocean springs Mississippi [noise] eleven year old Kris ... twelve year old Eric ...\nSet out to recreate raiders of the Lost Ark on video\nScene for scene [noise]\nEvery line of dialogue [noise] the entire film\nUsing the original screenplay score by John Williams\nNot only did they pull it off [noise]\nThey pretty much nailed it\nShooting for this ethic fan film it began in Nineteen eighty two and continued over the next seven summers on a shoestring budget five thousand dollars\nWhite possibly one of the best found films I remain [noise]\nThey have screenings for this thing over the world and everybody in Hollywood knows about it\nNow the idea to remake the film scene machine was hatched by then eleven year old Kris ... but it was twelve year old Eric ... who had all of the experience\nYeah I did a class in sixth grade which of course saw we wrote on the bus to elementary school together and and he as a result mistakenly thought I knew something about [noise]\nFilm so when he got the sweat the idea to remake raiders Lost Ark shot for shot 'em that and the fact that I borrowed is raise last comic book on the bus is what led him to give me a call and say hey\nI'm remaking ready to start do you want to help\nAnd I thought all the sets were built every one of those cats I just sort of walk on 'em help so that I Know the only thing that Chris then at that point was by the publisher screenplay and producer will do casts himself in the city and the shows\nSo weird and Chris get the idea to remake what was that a major blockbuster released in the early eighties he says it was all just about kids having fun the whole\nSort of originating idea was really bored out of more of a role playing than it was a it was a fantasy it was yeah creative project ensued and in a in a\nLife long collaboration in the suit but I don't think it was ever like [noise]\nI don't ever sick an editor minds you know like we sat down and thought okay well we're about to put a hole in the next several years of our allies and to create a project what else do you want to work on you know what other what other things that this is what we're doing and we're kind of going for it and [noise] and we had no longer no idea how long it was going to take us\nSo we sort of dove and and did it so I don't I don't know if we had that spectrum of creative thinking yet I think it was just like hey this is that this is what we're doing and what did the exciting if we just sort of went after it with that\nChild like energy how did these kids in southern Mississippi back in the early eighties pull it off [noise] Eric explains that wasn't really\nAs a ah eleven and twelve year old respect like growing up in Mississippi in the eighties pre Internet\nYou know how do you make a twenty six million dollar movie on your allowing us you know we knew nothing about it and for the first year so we kind of\nFiguratively speaking corrupt right in the darkness as far as cigarette out how you do that you know I wrote a six hundred page shot and then it got to the end and realized was worthless you know close up and he walks\nIn the room I mean what are you going to do with that and and then figure it out OK no story boards that's how the professional Stewart yeah yeah and it was sort of by us most of the filmmaking on the sly\nFilmmaking on the fly can sometimes get a little dangerous especially when kids are in charge one day there was a fire on the ...\nMost of the terrorists we shot in my mom's basement shut the big rambling basement multiple room [noise] so uh\nWe would we'd only shoot in the summertime um you know it's like summer camp you know we we do production pre production during the school year but during the summer that was our time so I'm\nThink a hundred and twenty percent humidity typical Mississippi summer day um start early and um [noise]\nAnd ah and I was on her down to the basement where [noise]\nYou know made up like a Nepalese saloon my dad's old wine bottles lining the [noise] lining the or the shelves and and Jason are cameramen as wiring up squid go off in the wall um [noise]\nWe have a you know the\nThe Nepalese saloon nearly burned down down\nOur moms and shut us down in the previous summer because well they fought a shower I mean my back on fire and some reason I have a problem with that so they let us continue with the two words adult chaperone and found an adult even less responsible than we were [noise]\nHelped us a guy to when you know there wasn't a fire in a certain edges was framed you know more or gasoline over there so when we didn't bring house down don't try this at home catch\nWhen making a film be it in Hollywood or Mississippi there are several stages of production there's pre production shooting and post production here again is Eric on the pre production\nJust to build this monumental tribute shown\nFirst summer was entirely nothing but reproduction drunk story board scouting locations casting costumes props year too we finally shot and kept none of it because again we didn't know anything about so many [noise]\nUm so there's very few shots there that we actually kept from that first year but there are certain things that we just would shoot over and over and over again\nThrough a trial and error we slowly picked up things about learning about composition lighting blocking acting and bit by bit we got better and only when we're satisfied with the quality of a shot and other scene when we move onto the next\nYou know these kids are obviously determined to get the film made but there was another major hurdle that they have to overcome back in the early eighties and that was just simply having access to the film that they were trying to recreate\nWe only actually saw the movie a few times you know a\nA N worked\nPretty much from memory for the first handful of years and so some actually came out on laser disc ... and so we cobbled together [noise]\nAbsolutely everything that we could in terms of you know raiders paraphernalia you know a story books and magazines and and bubblegum cards and and all that stuff the comic book and a screen play an end to the best of our memory sat down and and Eric\nChiseled out well over six hundred individuals story boards that we've been used as a blueprint but we you know we went back to the theater as much as we could\nYou know for those of us who remember the eighties there were there in video stores were really in there and to see that you couldn't really go down and read whatever you want it you know um there wasn't a veil ability issue you know and and that was a movie when they could have re release things so when the movie was released in the theater we went back and\nWatched it you know again as much as our you know allows would allow\nFor the boys ended up finishing their seen by scene remake of regions of the Lost Ark with their big premier add an auditory the local Coca Cola bottling plant in Gulfport, Mississippi and August twelfth [noise] Nineteen eighty nine\nBullets Erin de la and Jason lamb just finished an eight year re creation\nTrio we mirrored their version of the even the ... the raiders and the last time\nI have an agent film and TV [noise] it's the hardest thing I've ever done so far\nWe've been following this story up in the past three years it got the scene by turning back the hands of time I think one heck why [noise]\nIt was shut out of sequence of due to its long filming period many actors randomly appear at different ages throughout the course of the film they completed every scene in the film except for one of the few complicated and expensive for the kids to convincingly pull off\nThe scene from raiders were Indiana Jones isn't a fist fight with the big ball Nazi next to an airplane with rotating propellers at the last moment when India is getting his ass kicked the Nazi gets hit by the plane propeller and shredded into a million buddy pieces that splattered all over the side of the airplane\nIs a pretty good ethical shuttering it's only seeing the\nKids couldn't match after setting mom's basement on fire it was probably a good idea to nix the death by propeller seen\nThe boys went their separate ways going off to college in the film was largely forgotten till two thousand three when the film producer got his hands on the copy in the remake\nHere's critic some film getting discovered all those years later\nI didn't even tell my wife has an Indiana Jones has so she had no idea that I hadn't even done this raiders thing and so when it got discovered in two thousand and three and like exploded you know and got us into Vanity Fair and we're all sudden touring\nAround the United states and going to Germany and Australia and you know my wife has like um so what's your raiders thing you know I mean can you like let me see it you know like a it's like this thing that I did and you know I still have that like [noise]\nThat reaction and she said this is cool this is great\nAnd an apple said All right we'll fix it so instead of just having like two rounds circles there's now to round circles that looked like a bagel with there's cream cheese on it okay it's just a plain bagel\nMean I Am expecting a formal complaint from the cinnamon raised in bagel counsel at least within the next seven today in days don't you think so yes and you say ladies and gentlemen boys and girls just an example of all the fun that we have here a week after week as we talk about\nLiving the bats digital lifestyle ever we talked about all those gadgets and gizmos and making money and saving money and now the nation's largest weekend show broadcast over four hundred top stations from coast to coast and you can hear us around the globe on American forces network radio that's a hundred and Seventy seven different countries\nAnd every ship at sea against the game commando show and it's called the game commando show because after all I'm America's ... digital gotta came commando here with you once again\nOnly really funny and the phone\nLines are open I'm sure you have at least a few questions about something digital I can lend a hand to that number's one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us\nOnce again that number's one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four and as your calling in and let's get this party started already with our global tech news of the week up day we put this together for you every single wage for that this way you're in the know about all things digital and we're going to start\nThis week news with the oh my gosh a little item from those busy little hacker department that's right word out of the dark Web ... is our busy this election season\nA massive disclosure of voter records is estimated to exceed get the thirty five million across Nineteen states crazy stuff\nOr the voter records include personal information vote during histories and this means that your full name your phone number your physical address another voter data is basically out there on the dark Web for sale\nSo altogether thirty million people in Nineteen states and some marketing genius actually pulled it altogether and selling it in math because the state's hadn't been hacked to this information is publicly available online somebody just put it all together now this is why I bring\nIt up there was a recent case where four men women were indicted in Texas and they were paid to target elderly voters in a scheme to generate large numbers of mail ballot sending harvest those ballots for a specific candidate so I'll be on the lookout\nOh by the way the true story I saw this on the Internet this past week there\nWas a sign of it on the door of an Internet hacker and you know what the signs had\nGone fishing get it gone fishing [noise]\nAlright anyone who has ever been to New York city you know it's a tough town there's the crowds the traffic the noise best and the crime welfare not here to to to take a bite at a crime that of the big apple\nAre you ready or the robot sets right there now patrolling the streets and they can see\nWhat you're doing and they can even talk to you need to robot has five cameras\nFor which helped a little things the different things the other is to get thermal imaging data so the robots watch people walking on the sidewalks and record license plate numbers they can detect heat and objects they can see which cell phones serial number\nIs within a designated patrolling area\nNight scope or the makers of the road but they say that the data secure and it's only seen by the security controlling the robot\nThey're able to stop it and tell us what to look for but nice gave that they can't follow a specific person [laughter] yeah right okay the company says it costs between six dollars and twelve dollars an hour for the new robot to hit the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I give us thirty minutes before someone knocks it over and then just stripped down for parts [noise]\nOr when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers now have a drone accessible to them that's right and twenty six Tina\nDrone came within two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX\nBut what does that collusion has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of Dayton research Institute impact physics division and he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer that he arrived at isn't very reassuring is group is able to launch things that high rates of speed so it was able to simulate a crash using the right wing of a loony em twenty plane and then a drone\nWith a DJ I've fandom to ... to point one pounds and then he had the biggest their cat in his lab could actually handle so the banter wasn't certain does forty foot cannon released to edit speed up two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour it hit point zero three seconds later\nAnd although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object and that's key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like a spoof through chocolate moose than if you're a kids club member and you're watching the video can actually see\nThe drone go into the aircrafts wing explains that the drone traveled deep enough into the wing to damage in\nMaine weight bearing bar in other words the aircraft would crash\nAnd let's now turn to something even more frightening yes Facebook that's right I told you last week about\nThe new Facebook video camera and microphone it looks like like a mini tablet it's a a home assistant they say it's got to compete against Google Home apple home pot and Amazon blacks and Facebook called their hardware the poor\nDo it why would anyone trust Facebook enough to put a Facebook powered microphone and video camera in their living room or kitchen I mean you just look at Facebook's history of lack of privacy they don't care anything about our security\nSo the Web site Recode actually wrote that on their site I'm going to read it to you\nKnow data collected through portal even called log dead or apt to use the data like the fact that you listen to this bottle fi will be used to target users with ads on Facebook a year right\nOkay they say they wrote that because that's what they were told by Facebook executives are you ready here's a shocker the data about who you call the data about which apps you use what you'd do on this portal will be used to target you with ads\nOn Facebook and other Facebook own property so yeah baseball gets another data stream or its advertising targeting business which is where you again or the product you buy the and as I like to say you really are a ... bird [noise]\nAlright Christmas is ride around the corner and some of the hottest selling items this year for gifts or we're talking about smart speakers\nAnd of course you've got smart watches specifically the apple watch for they started about four hundred dollars depending upon storage weather works on
