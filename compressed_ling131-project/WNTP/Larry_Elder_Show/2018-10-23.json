southern border we have\nA suit non me a disaster coming up to our border going to knock on our door in two to three weeks and this is something in this country needs to talk about needs to address it needs to stop right now because nobody has a right to\nBe here let's be clear nobody's got a right to be here and let's be clear about something else as these migrants march up to our southern border both sides are playing politics\nThe Democrats CNN in the media and they're all on doing their thing spinning this like oh my God America's so\nMean these people are seeking asylum the best of America is we open up our arms or that Donald Trump needs Republicans they're so dang me\n[laughter] they're playing politics looked in did you know that in what Fifteen days we have a really important election you need to remember that you need to keep that right front and center\nIn fact how about a new rule right it's been this way for a while but I understand that everything Donald Trump says right now is all about the midterms for the next fourteen days anything that any politician says\nIt's all political\nWhatever they say about taxes or whatever they say about the border whatever they say about Saudi Arabia or whatever they say about this caravan everything that every politician says for the next Fifteen days it's\nAll political it's all\nDesigned to position their side for the midterms I'm including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer I'm including every Democrat running for office I'm including President Trump and every Republican running for office come on now open your eyes\nEvery word they order these next Fifteen days it's all about control of the house and control of the Senate and look you know where I stand on this okay\nShut the border to build the wall shut that build that wall lock the door shut our border nobody can come in this country illegally end of story there's no it's like I look at this and I'm I'm Wondering like what's the debate what\nIs the issue no seriously I look at this caravan of seven to fourteen thousand people from\nHonduras Guatemala and Mexico I I look at them walking up to our southern border to ring the doorbell they're not going to ring the doorbell they're just going to try to walk through the door I'm looking at this and I'm I'm I'm trying to honestly figure out what is the debate\nWhat's the discussion nobody can just come in\nWhat are we talking about nobody can come into the country illegally I don't care if you got ten people marching up or ten thousand people marching up\nThese Americans these arms our citizens\nI mean my God you know that in Chicago this afternoon six people were shot leaving a funeral\nOutside of a church leaving a funeral six Americans were shot this afternoon way to go to Chicago hey everybody can give it to Chicago or hand write Democrat Ron gun control rules Chicago\nThat's our problem that's all of our problem to violence on the south side of the city\nI I don't understand is why the these are a bunch of ... look I I don't know these people I I'm sure most of them these Hondurans and Guatemalans I'm sure most of them are good people who are just trying to do whatever they can do I mean this to get a better life\nBut what what what's what's the issue\nThat's not our problem\nDon't call me mean spirited don't call me cold hearted it's not our problem now look I Know politics is politics so you got a caravan of ten eleven twelve thousand people marching up to our border it's a political issue I get it but to sit in our\nProblem to sit in our problem\nI mean think about it in two to three weeks fourteen thousand people are going to hang out outside your house our house\nExcuse me excuse me call the police I mean if if if\nTwo hundred people hung out outside your front door what would you do you call the police right in about two or three weeks we're going to have ten fourteen Fifteen thousand people hanging out outside of our border right on our border where do we do\nThis is why we have a military this is why we have a border patrol\n\nVisiting our problem this is an issue\n\nNo body can just walk into this country no body can invade this country\n\nThis is going to grow weirdly politically\nBoth sides want this caravan issue to grow politically\nThe Republicans think they got a winner\nTrump and the Republicans think they got a winner it's all about the border and national security and by the way Republicans you haven't started to build a wall right what have you done Democrats think they have a winner\nRight the all the [laughter] most of the American people are humane and compassionate and they're going to see these women and children at our border in two to three weeks and man that's going to move their votes and this is going to grow as a political issue\n\nBut just give me the facts just give me the facts\nWe have anywhere from ten to fourteen thousand people\nRight now as you listen to me right now\nThis number has grown it was seven thousand people this morning estimates now are somewhere between ten and fourteen thousand people don't you tell me that there's not some coordination going on don't you tell\nMe that there's that some organization behind a lot of is don't even do that man\nAnd you've got a lot of people just died and jumping in like this is a big parade you got people you have people in Guatemala you got people in Mexico just jumping out to be part of this caravan coming up to markets coming up to America\n\nIt'll probably grow some more\n\nBut the facts declare facts\nJust because you have ten\nOr eleven or twelve thousand people from Honduras who are looking for a better life okay I hear ya I get it I feel for you but that does not mean you have a right to come into our country illegally\n[laughter] it doesn't mean you have a right to come into America period\nI mean my God what's the number right how many billions around the world right now I Would love to be in America right for a better life that's not our deal\n\nCould President Trump is warning threatening to cut off financial aid Honduras Guatemala and Mexico if they don't stop this caravan\n\nAgain I don't know [noise] you know full disclosure I don't believe anything the president says but that's a good idea especially Mexico we ought to come down like a ton of bricks I'm Mexico right now stop these people\n\nSince he think about this\nThat are being cameras in front of these folks right because the media loves this the media wants these people here\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's only going to grow the closer they get to our border but most everybody when the cameras put in front of their face they all say the same thing they're looking for a job they're looking to improve their financial situation they won a better life economically excuse me\n\nThat's not a reason to seek asylum that's not a reason to be approved for a piece for asylum\n\nPresident Trump rightly talking about engaging the military I Want to tell you something if two three weeks from now we got ten eleven twelve thousand people pounding on our door at the southern border damn straight we ought to the military down their\n\nDamn straight we oughta we cannot make the same mistake we made five months ago when we let a smaller group of migrants just come into this country we cannot do that again I'm Joe Walsh show going\n[noise]\n\nRight you wanna you wanna walk through my front door you want to walk through our front door you want to walk on my front lawn and you're waving your

been doing it for years it's become a real threat over the last few years ago we know this\nYou we know for certain to you and I know for certain that among these tend to fourteen thousand people

effort it's a very organized effort to get fourteen thousand or\nNon Americans into this country illegally that's the end game that's the end game you've got fourteen thousand people here who they say are seeking asylum baloney these are fourteen thousand people who just want to be in America\nPeriod and with CNN's help the Democrats are going to do whatever they can to get these people in here\nIt's not you know what is that can be easy but it's got to be stopped uh and and I I have no doubt that Trump will generally say what he needs to say but remember we been here before we were here in April and may and win a thousand of them got to our border right of eventually or\nThe cameras man the pictures became too tough and and most of those thousand got into America because even the Trump Administration did not want the bad P.

D humanizing thank you\nTrans gender Americans transgender activists slam US government plan to define gender male and female and an actual headlines said horrible\nThe Trump Administration wants to define gender as biological sex at birth that's horrible\nTrans genders could be defined out of existence under Trump trends genders will be erased under Trump\nAnd on and on and on a wet all because of a memo from the U.S department of health and Human Services that argues that\nFed or are you sitting down because this is like monumental this memo from H H ass argues that\nFederal agencies need a definition of sex and gender that is defined are you ready on a biological basis that it's clear and grounded in science and objective\nAnd administrative all the Trump Administration announced that they are moving forward with efforts\nTo define gender on the basis of biological sex [laughter] and all hell broke loose on the left ... now you need to know ... again what the Trump Administration is announcing that they are intending to do\nThat's got the left all of Twitter and Democrats are all a Twitter and the L G BP Q W X Y Z community all a Twitter is to say that that section gender is based on biology\nNow that may seem pretty obvious to most of us but this\nDecision by the Trump Administration will reverse or the Obama administration which said that which allowed individuals to choose their own sex for federal government purposes for programs\nAnd education and set aside\nThe Obama administration announced that anybody can just be whatever sex or gender they want to be a for the sake of any federal government program\nAnd the new Trump Administration memo making clear no no can't do that can't do that uh we got to base it on like um um science like biology and by the way he's in his are always the damn this thing that you and me\nAnd those of us who are not like a\nCrazy about climate change they accuse us of being anti science but damn when it down when it comes to gender insects or it it it is the last\nThat just doesn't believe in basic things like a biology this is a big deal by the way it's a good thing it's a very good thing with the Trump Administration is doing because it will impact\nOr because of what the Obama administration had done under title nine of the ... section of the Nineteen Seventy two law that bars sex based discrimination in federally funded education institutions in federal programs\nUm [noise] the Trump Administration now making clear\nThat these decisions on sex and gender are going to be based on biology the left his outraged I'm a ... they they they think that\nUh the words man and woman are are are much more nuanced and not quite as clear as you and me think like you're either born a male or you're born a female you're born with male equipment or you're born with female equipment that's kind of how we always used to do things\nBut the Obama administration expanded tanks and told everybody around the country are made it a according to ... for federal government program purposes or anybody can just choose their gender\nAnd be their gender\nAnd not have to prove they were born a certain gender now\nI I Need a stay at the outset here as well that this doesn't mean that if you identify out there is a transgender or says gender or whatever that can that second a defined you out of existence you can still call your you can still call yourself whatever you want to call yourself\nYou can label yourself whatever you want to label yourself what the Trump Administration will who will do this new memo this new edict reversing\nThe Obama administration what we'll do is it will allow the government to have an objective standard male female when implementing federal programs long overdue long time coming this is good Trump reverse scene [laughter]\nThe crazy upside down world we've lived in\nThese last six seven eight nine ten years\nThat affected college athletics right where men could identify as women had an unfair advantage or it impacted set aside or quota programs right\nBy the way it's set aside for a two to benefit real women and men could identify as women to take advantage of those set aside and quota programs\nIf government contracts for choir say that a certain number of sub contractors on some sort of project or have to be women run businesses well there needs to be a definition of what

there will be clear objective definition of\nWhat man is and what woman is and it will be based on biology and it will be based on science it it it just leaves me how the left in show many Democrats
