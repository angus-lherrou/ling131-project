[noise]\nLeft you with the following the whole question do you believe Mexico will stop the\nHere's\nThe problem [noise] this is the problem in in this is the problem that\nAre those of us in today's political lingo jargon you know you call yourself conservative you're a Tea Party or you're a you're a Republican you're on the right in today's political world here's our problem\nThose of you who think like I Do and in today's political jargon I'm a conservative here's our problem the other side gets to create the narratives the other side has\nA monopoly on the media the left does\nThe other side the laugh they've got a monopoly on academia they've got a monopoly on popular culture they've got a monopoly in Hollywood they've got a monopoly and when it comes to late night comedians all of that all of popular culture in the media\nIs pretty much all of its social media Facebook and Twitter and all the rest it's owned by the left\nIt's run by people on the left\nAnd they get to create the narrative they get to tell the country well here's what happened and this is what it means\nAnd see the problem is one side typically traditionally one side in America gets to create that narrative not my side and I'm not whining and I'm not complaining conservatives zone talk radio conservatives have Fox News in a number of other outlets\nAnd I get that in the year twenty Eighteen right\nMan we got we got to ... in different websites and podcast and there's alternative media I get all of that but still\nThe main line the mainstream media the legacy media all the newspapers all of network TV all of the major news stations all of the comedians all of Hollywood all of academia all of the writers they're all on the left\nAnd they get to tell the country seemingly all the time\nHere's what happened and here's what it means and you and I have to fight back against it so you look at what happened last week you look at that bad terrible horrible week\nThat ended with that bad horrible terrible evil shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and you know what happened we talked last night about what happened I'm not going to revisit the what happened part of this what does it mean what does it mean well if you've been paying attention to what the media\nHas been saying these last couple of days if you've been paying attention at all to what popular culture has been saying about what that synagogues shooting and the pipe bomber and that guy in Louisville, Kentucky what it all means is\nThe narrative out there now thanks to the last things to people on the left the narrative is that people on the right hates and people on the right to kill\nAnd it's only on the right it's only on the right eye or\nYou don't have to do this because you got to life thank God you have a life you've got a family got job you you you pay attention as best as you cat my appreciate that and I respect that\nBut as part of part of my job here I got to pay attention to all of it\nAnd I can tell you that ever since that synagogues shooting a narrative that narrative created is there's a bunch of hate in this country and it's fostered by the right and it faster is on the right and it is the sold the meaning of the right\nOnly on the right do another right wing hater another right wing\nAnti Semitic see all of this hate on the right it's all they'd been talking about for two days\nIt's all they talked about after the shooting that's all they talked about yesterday Sunday it's all they talked about Monday and they're still talking about it today as President Trump and millennia visit Pittsburgh there are protestors out there protesting the president's visit to Pittsburgh but the last few days\n\nI look I push back against it the other people and talk radio push back against that Fox News push back the conservative media\nPushes back against it but my friends right most of America doesn't get their news from Fox News most of America doesn't listen to the Joe Walsh show most of America is still getting their news from sources on the left\nThe BCS the NBC's The CNN's EMS and B c's all of the newspapers that comedians\n\nAnd they're all chime in in together to say we have a problem\nThis country there's too much hate and it's all on the right and I think\nThis Tuesday it is so freaking\nIncumbent upon us to push back against this narrative I feel like so much of a big part of what I Do on this radio show is push back against all these leftist narratives\nAny time something happens\nAnd then the left because they got the big megaphone they got the biggest megaphone and they explained to the country what it means what it means like like guns are bad we got to get rid of guns easing comment upon us to push back against these narratives as hard and as strongly as we can\n\nDon Lemon a he's a a a live he's a lefty on CNN last night he epitomize this\nCreation of the narrative there's something different about people on the right there at yeah you know what maybe there's hey I guess with everybody but only people on the right to kill people or something different about the right this narrative\nDon Lemon actually pushed this last night Don Lemon actually said last night and make the\nMade the point last night that well it's only Republicans who killed people it's only right wing or to kill people Democrats don't kill people hey dad gimme lemon number three\nFish guys are right wing or who kill the people in the synagogue very I'm very right wing or sent 'em bombs to CNN and to Democrats [noise] I don't see Democrats killing people\nNow um\nThat's just kind of stupid and and that's a stupid thing to say like right now\nAnd and a to point out how stupid that is in fact Devon I loved that can you give me that again a limited number three from last night\nThis guy has a right wing or who killed the people in a synagogue\nVery I'm very right wing or sent 'em bombs so CNN and to Democrats [noise] I don't see Democrats\nKilling people I don't see Democrats killing people\nDown limit on CNN or ... and he's not alone you need to know that most of what I've heard the last few days since that synagogue Killeen ... was pretty much this variations of this it's\nOnly the people on the right that are killing people\nNow if you are scratching your\nHead right now if you're rubbing your eyes right now if you're about to pull off the road right now because Don Lemon said that last night\nUh\nUh ... not even a year after\nA ... a Democrat or hard core lefty a took a gun a firearm to a Republican\nCongressional baseball practice and proceeded to try to\nKill kill a bunch of Republican members of Congress that just stop for a minute now I\nI don't know Don Lemon I've been on a show a few times I don't know if he's a real dummy that Saddam's stupid thing to say you you'd think before ... said something like that\nYou'd think as he's like halfway through making that point I don't see Democrats killing people I don't see Democrats feeling people you'd think somebody already is getting a whisper into his\nHis earpiece excuse me Mr ... congressmen Steve ...\nOh yeah congressmen Steve school lease who's lucky to be alive he was shot by a Democrat\nHe was shot by a leftist an angry left is\n\nAnd there's a list beyond that but to say something like that in a year after\nYou got what happened on that congressional baseball field and to say that I don't see Democrats killing people\n[noise]\nPresident Trump radical as more\nPeople than an ISIS yes and and you just look at this point that this ... this political op\nUh agenda uh it it just it it's absolutely it's just soaking in the end and you know I I just I just pray that that that conservatives Republicans whatever you want to call your stuff you get out and you and your vote is just the most important leak and\nThe most important mid term of our of our life and and we have a president that his ... promises and we need to support this right agenda\nHey mark a well set all good call man do it again you ought to call again I'm there said on the right in the last why is that so hard to say\nWhy is that so difficult to say\nOur problem is those of us on the right every day we're bombarded by the the left this narrative that day there's only on the right we got to push back\nAgainst this [noise]\nAll the time to check the freedom of voicemail when you're saying about John Wayne\nShows is is it down [noise] um\nYou know that police had my own I Want to finish telling you the place had my phone and they were talking to

would that affect how about everybody just be ahead of broccoli\nEvery kid should be broccoli for Halloween I'm trying to think of who that might offend\n\nMm and vegetables\nI don't think she could be fruit because that might offend certain people because the word fruit still has negative connotations when you talk about certain folks in the world today so I again I don't know that you can go
