{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "Aligning with God the father son unholy goes to um hey look at embrace those divine appointments and uh and embrace the words that the Holy Spirit deposit send us that we're just share with others to enlarge them and to make their day some\nUh it can we talk Halloween for just a moment here we go to any word it was a Danny of course a good friend of the shows with focus on the family he is the vice president of parenting or because of we need vice presidents of parenting I tell you [laughter]\nThat's hilarious bill hey thanks for having me on the show ... percent\nAnd good to have you're talking about Halloween but when we get into a some of the stuff I mean when did you make and I was curious to get your read on this\nIs that you got some cities are in the country you know banning Thirteen year olds for trick or treating on Halloween I mean ah all this stuff is just a it's like whoa you know maybe we're better off just doing trunk or treat huh\n[laughter] trucker so that's why sometimes just simplifying Halloween would be would be really nice back in the\nBack ... ... maybe a decade or two decades ago we didn't have some of the the deviant issues that go along with Halloween and a lot of rules around that it was just a time for for funds for many families and it\nCertainly was with media social media or movies some of the the darkness around Halloween horror movies ... or has taken it to a different level but we\nDon't have to go there's Christians we can we can go our own direction with the opportunity to pretend and imagine\nYou know exactly and there's nothing wrong with that but it's when it's gone overboard as you say a and were reflecting a meals with music that's put out into the culture of movies\nUh decentralization of our young people I mean you know some of these things that I mean I'm sure when when you see some of these kids walking around and even going to school and the way they're dressed up and you think oh my God you know what what what is going on here\nYes you know I've I've a Thirteen year old daughter and a Fifteen year old son as many of you know and ah my son has had a lot of his friends binge watching horror movies and not close friends but just run school people are knows that\nAre around this time they're saying hey we're going to go watch this this hormone as a group do you want to calm or or we're gonna we're in and watch hours and hours of\nOr movies and and then some of the music that that comes out with that group it does it does create some great conversations with your hands on you know what it means to have your mind and renewing your mind what what it means for on the on the Halloween when it interacts with their mind what what does that mean and\nUh it's a great conversation my son about guarding your heart and your mind and horror movies are made to to scare and\nI think there's a lot of demonic stuff was it really\nWell and that's the thing and and why you know Christians have been\nEspecially a protective over this and not wanting their kids to participate you know churches have responded as I mentioned with the events you know fall festivals trunk or trade you know where there's candy give out and you know that kind of deal and so the kids can\nHave it and uh you know the the uh the costumes that we see at churches are not before we're seeing on this [laughter] ... cities are because some of those are really you know just bizarre\nAnd uh I'm I'm like you Danny I'm all for you know imagination I'm all for the creativity\nUm in fact we used to have a dear friend of ours I mean she was she was gifted it was like God designed for Halloween you she would she would come up and she would constrict and her kids always one you know the best costumes in school and stuff like that she was just so creative and how she put these costumes together and\nI remember with beauty and the beast when ah you know that was a hit movie I mean she dressed up these kids and you think oh my gosh that they came up a Hollywood back [laughter] you know it\nWas a terrific you know\nThere's some there's some great costumes out there I think a lot of churches have\nBecome very creative and and it creates some some wonderful opportunity for kids to express their imagination about the Bible dressing up as the Bible character getting to talk about that character is and why they dressed up as a character and some youth groups will do\nA like an escape rumor mystery thing where they go together and and have a time of a fun and an enjoyment together and some snacks and\nYou know we were were were created we don't have to go out and dressed up as ... and all kinds of things to have a good time on Halloween you can uh it it there's super heroes and talking about that we're you know I for me and my family we've\nHad to use this opportunity to talk about our new identity and Christ that we have\nThe opportunity where and caution cautious three Paul says we're as Christians were giving given a new identity putting on the new cells but\nIn reality if we look at where kids are out today there's a lot of pretending that goes on throughout the year just to get love and imagine if in Halloween you talked about what does it mean to be an authentic real person\nAnd and talking about that identity that that we haven't Christ and living that out the rest of the time in Halloween is the only day that we pretend to be someone else instead of the entire year\nYou know exactly well and I think what would you bring up here Danny as the Christians have ... kind of incense got caught off balance here with Halloween\nBecause it it it kind of morphed into a um you know something that was so I'm a confronted and in contrast to ah to our Christian faith and it's just seems like it's gotten worse than so ah Christians have kind of falling back on their heels as opposed to saying okay\nHow can we take back this holiday and you know bring the family fun back into Halloween\n[noise] [noise] yeah I agree actually paying for it is a good place to go I'm thinking I was thinking about things that are true and what are what our mind can do but ... and the creativity of our mind and and talking about that that scripture alone Philippines for a is a is a great way to look at\nHalloween what are some truth thinks about at one truth thing is we can be creative God has created us to have an imagination we can have fun and we can play together as a family that part is very healthy\nSo let's do it that way we don't have to participate in those the the other things that are very dark about Halloween and I think it shows that contrast of good and evil Halloween brain certainly brings that out\nIn a very clear way and I think this is great preparation for the best Thanksgiving season and Christmas season when you when we\n... we began our time as a family with fun and and imagination take this time that maybe maybe maybe it's the beginning of of some movie a weekend so throughout the time all the way up till Christmas as a family and picking those out maybe it's a time of\nA celebrating a superhero times and what what\nSuperpowers God has given us through prayer and through the Holy Spirit maybe it's just a plain brand some games out every year around this time you your brand game out and then and you play that same game around Halloween this you can still create some great to traditions around us and it doesn't have to be dark\nWell didn't you know what you said here and I and I hope people caught this is that you this is a perfect time to engage the kids\nYou know and have and get them involved in the conversation you don't ... you know you don't have to have the answers you talk to them and just say hey you know what does it mean to you you know what I'm you know what do you think about Halloween men and uh you know get their\nYou know and you'd be surprised the answers they come up with and in fact one of my buddies he asked his kids because that will get just for a moment pretend you're ... you're you're dead\nAnd you have children how would you know how would you want to celebrate you know a Halloween ... what would you what would you tell and I mean it was amazing the answer I mean the kids get it they're really\nThey're really sharp and you sit there you go gosh here I Am I I was so worried about how to approach and what to say to him and stuff like that and they actually brought more of the table than I had you know\n[laughter] the other day the family were were sitting around and we\nDo this with with some of the families council and that's pretending to be someone else in the family so everyone takes on someone else for all right then you take on an issue like pretend that you're late somewhere or something like that and then you pretend to be that person\nIs it gives each other early and it gave each uh each of us a lot of insight into how we handle stress\nHow we handle conversations and we had a great laugh that's another thing you can do and and as parents hate dress up have fun with this um ah they pretend to be someone at the end and then explain this is why I Love to pretend to be this person\nUh I I Know that with our with our family we've had some themes together as a family it shows that unity we've had fun with it I wore wig I have a shaved head and my kids have completely enjoyed seeing me it was a big head of hair [laughter] uh and so we can have fun let's laugh at each other and\nAnd a greatly enjoy tonight be creative as a family or or actually this weekend I'm sure there's a lot at church parties and different things going on\nA and and let's let's bring some good nest and the light to where there's darkness in Halloween brings plenty of darkness\nSpring some light to it or he learned to show that as Christians we can still have fun we can still imagine we can still be creative and and helping our kids see that living out the Christian faith because about living out an identity that God has given us\nA ... to live out in and finding that out as a family and along the way thing that we do lots to pretend to be other people because we see a lot of good things in each other ... and that's part of being a body of try\nRight and and and what you say Danny is so important and that is that we're prepared sometimes we just get ... we react to the holiday and as Christians we should be prepared in and out of seasons so here's the opportunities saying okay the world is already moving in this direction is kind of like a little bit of\nWith literally one of the greatest radio shows ever broadcast\nOn escape you know ... was a terrific series of high adventure in mystery came to radio for seven seasons
