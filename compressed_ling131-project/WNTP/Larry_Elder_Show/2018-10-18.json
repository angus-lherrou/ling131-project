B. Pritzker Democrat candidate for governor and his campaign\nThat these ten to twelve black and Latino campaign workers were quote herded into race specific positions\nThey received less favorable treatment than their white counterparts are counterparts while also enduring over and envious racial discrimination\nThe female a campaign workers allege harassment again these tend to what is it ten or twelve\nThese it at least ten at least ten black and Latino campaign workers\nIt could be more\nAlleging\nShocking behavior\nOn the part of the Democrat candidate for governor ... campaign\nStaffers complain in this a lawsuit that they were discriminated against on the basis of their race that they were forced to perform racist tasks such as quote go round up forty black guys for an event\nThey were stationed in minority neighborhoods they say sometimes in unsafe areas ah they were denied resources given to white campaign workers stationed in white neighborhoods these campaign workers go onto a ledge\nOr that when they ask why J. B. Pritzker refused to make an appearance at the campaign office on Chicago's south side in a neighborhood that had seen a wave of violence they were told quote he'll visit when they stopped shooting\nThey're asking for seven point five million dollars in damages they're asking for personal recommendations for each staffer\nAnd they're demanding that the J. B.

B. Pritzker three weeks before the election\nIt's the Democrats who are tell us that\nEvery allegation needs to be heard and in fact it's the Democrats who typically tell us every allegation needs to be believed every allegation of harassment or discrimination right it's always the last and the Democrats who say you got to believe\nI mean my God why would think about this for a minute\nThree weeks from the election why would at least ten black and Latino campaign workers sued the campaign three weeks before the election\n... why would they do that\nAnd don't put this on the Republicans I don't know don't put this on governor Bruce Rauner in his campaign I don't know I mean boy I'll tell you what this should be incredible work if they were able to round up in the lineup lineup and round up a or at least ten Pritzker campaign workers\n\nThe Illinois GOP issued a statement\nThe lawsuit filed against Jamie ... campaign is simply the latest in a long line of incidents that prove that when it comes to the African American community Pritzker actions don't back up his words here we have his own staffers\nSeason political operatives alleging racial discrimination and harassment\nIt will be interesting\nTo see how big of a story this becomes\nAnd again to be careful of this was a lawsuit filed yesterday\nAlleging racial discrimination within the G ... campaign we're not talking about one two three or even for minority campaign workers we're talking about at least ten black and Latino campaign workers\nAlleging horrible and discriminatory work place practices alleging harassment staffers allege that they were hired to fill quotas and they were tasked with racist jobs\n[noise]\nYou know\nThe Democrats have a problem here not only again post Kavanaugh hearing right where you got to believe we got to believe every allegation I'm a\nEvery woman needs to bully it'd be believe these these a black female and black Latino campaign workers\nUm I I Know they're they've been telling us we got to believe right you got to believe the allegations Jamie ... I mean ... be ... been on record that when a woman comes forward man the woman's got to be our well then I I assume that these allegations then this lawsuit needs to be hurt\nI mean you you you're three weeks out from an election you got the Democratic candidate for governor in ...

time\nBut while she's Cochran prevailed if his firing could happen in the Bible belt of the south man it could happen to you where you live where you work and there will be more battles ahead according to alliance defending freedom senior counsel David court than\nI Do I see more challenges in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened\nIn the chiefs case and then all of these other cases you know we hear so much today about tolerance in a coup city it was the exact reason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing a chief and it's quite ironic to say that we're being inclusive intolerant I firing someone who disagrees with artificial views that that would actually have\nThat's why it's so urgent that you help us support alliance defending freedom\nIt is a Wednesday back with you I Hope you're doing well\nThank you for listening by the way again you've got three weeks until election day if you want to get out and knock on doors will not

so simple let me live my life leave me alone\nLet me live my life I'll let you live your life let me live my life let me keep my money let me on my guns let me start a business let me raise my family um let me by my health care let me do my saying\nLeave me alone government leave me alone leave me alone let me were shut my God let me say whatever the hell I Want to say let me hang out with\nWhoever I Want to hang out with um leave me alone\nLet me I've I've got basic free speech you've got basic free speech I don't give a damn if what you say offends me or insults me I don't care I generally believe in freedom more than anything\nThen when it comes to free speech boy I'll tell you what I did to me pretty much anything goes\nI I don't want [laughter] I Am so afraid of of the government\nAnd we're already seeing this play out in Europe or seeing the play out here in America the government trying to get in this speech the government trying to get into religious liberty I'm just so afraid of that I Believe generally people should be able to say whatever they want\nTo say whatever they want to say\nAnd I generally believe like on Twitter like I'm social media I ... if if Twitter war mine\nIf I were in charge of Twitter man I I ... my policy would be pretty much anything goes I generally let people tweet whatever they want to tweet\nI I don't want Twitter banning certain speech banning certain offensive tweets I don't want to go down that road I wouldn't if I were the king if I were the king of Twitter\nI wouldn't go down that road at all Louis Farrakhan he is an anti Semite Lewis Farrah Khan hates Jews\nLouis Farrakhan doesn't like white people he's a racist she hates white people he believes white people are inferior man that's racism he believes that Jews are the devil man that's anti Semitic\nBut in my world the fluids Farrah Khan wants to go up on the Twitter and post something hateful\nAnd defensive about Jews in my world the freedom if I were in charge of Twitter let him do it so when Louis Farrakhan yesterday sent out a tweet\nComparing Jews to termites ... if\nI if Twitter war mine he wouldn't violate any policy as long as ... I mean I look I Believe that is a that is offensive that's beyond offensive to believe that Jews are termites or but again if I were king of Twitter\nFarrah Khan has got a right to tweet that and in fact he did not the first time he did but yesterday Louis Farrakhan tweeted that Jews were termites compare Jews to rats and compare Jews to termites\nAnd Twitter announced that that tweet of Louis Farrakhan yesterday was not in violation of their quote de humanizing language policy\nAnd let me say for the record again if Twitter were mine there would be no de humanizing language\nPolicy but Twitter's got it they have a policy against the humanizing language now for the record to compare Jews to termites to say that Jews are termites\nI'm\n... pretty deep humanizing that right there that language right there ...\n\nAgain I don't believe in a ... policy a dehumanizing language policy but Jews are termites Jews rats yeah I I think if you tweet that ... humanizing but Twitter\nAnnounced this morning that that tweet of Louis Farrakhan ... did not violate their\nPolicy here's my problem and here's my problem with Twitter and here's my problem with Facebook and here's my problem with Instagram\nAnd here's my problem with CNN and here's my problem with NBC and all the rest you and I know I Know you and I know\nThat if I sent out a tweet and I said Muslims are termites Muslims are worse than termites\nYou and I know that if I sent out a tweet express seen the human I seen language against Muslims\nYou and I know that that would be flagged by Twitter you and I know that that tweet in mind if I went after Muslims if I insulted Muslims you and I know\nThat Twitter would strike down that tweet would ban that tweet and we'll probably suspending me from Twitter telling me that I violated Twitter's de humanizing language policy\n\nBecause you and I are aware of too damn many instances of people getting booted off of Facebook and booted off the Twitter when they go after

I'm hopping Alexandra but it it just ... your your quick take on the house control of the house um\nI I think the conventional wisdom still is the Democrats are the favored to assume control but that's no sure thing is it\nI don't think it's a sure thing and I kind of buy into that conventional wisdom for the most part but I Do think if you look at the enthusiasm gap I'll be going into a midterm election first term president\nThe momentum was very much on the Democratic side and I think it still is but to me I think that the whole cabinet confirmation fight than that it's on people's mind\nI think that at least has helped a little bit here out that enthusiasm gap and get more Republican a little bit more wrapped up and they might otherwise be especially if they're happy with that sort of President Trump status quo might be staying home I think you might need some more of those voters turning out and then maybe suburbs I'm In certain places that might end up chicken a couple of those races back that year pie\nI Know you ... and if it feels like a lifetime ago already the Kevin I'm hearing and I know you\nCovered it extensively I mean we're twenty days away from an election in maybe this is a stupid question if it is I Apologize when most people go to the polls in twenty days are they still going to have the whole cabinet mess on their minds to think\nI think that's I think that's the most important question right now honestly because it is if it is on their mind I think that'll be intensely motivating for Republican voters and to me\nIt's lost about what those voters are thinking once they get to them on your booth and much more about\nIs that if you're going to be important enough to drive them to the polls because again the status quo for Republicans right now probably happy with the economy and for the most part happy with the president out or at least a policy that we've gotten the last two years might not really feel or the emphasis to get out and vote but in the states like Indiana\nMissouri North Dakota places where there are a democratic incumbent\nPeople who voted against a Brett Kavanaugh I think voted Republican voters might be thinking to themselves hey look I Know something off it but I I don't want my democratic senator and there anymore and this is that bad I got to do something\nWhat ... what this this whole notion of this gender gap or there's this chasm between ... with women those opposed to to Trump and wanting to vote Democrat because they opposed Trump as as to those who support Republicans it's huge the gap is pretty big why is that\nI mean there's no question that that gap in there and it and I I think it's not I don't like the fact that oftentimes electrical treat women as a model is that right I think conservatives really need to take seriously the fact that that gap it's there and I think to me I my read on it is that the president has a a certain style and a certain kind of rhetoric that\nI think perhaps turns off women more than anything look at the other day I called story Daniels for say yesterday you had like five but uh things like that again it's not about the policies and conservative women I\nUsed to do this job and I know a GOP\nAnd the president but for a lot of women that kind of stuff is intensely alienating and understandably\nAnd and so again conventional wisdom tell me if you buy it or not because of that outside of conservative women all the other women in the country are the most people think that's gonna really impact a lot of these house races\nI think that's right and I ...

deficit\nFor this past fiscal year that just ended a September thirty I'm Donald Trump's\nFirst full fiscal year the budget deficit uh jumped up to Seventy seven hundred and eighty billion dollars a a Seventeen percent increase\nOver to prior year or the highest budget deficits since two thousand and twelfth [noise] um and\nI remember this story broke Monday the same day that everybody and their mother was talking about Elizabeth Warren and her DNA results saying how much of an Indian itchy and how much Indian blood does she have dinner\n\nAnd and this was the topic did you are on conservative talk radio on Fox News\nAnd I I I didn't have much interest in it that to me it's just a silly stupid story\nOr Elizabeth Warren getting a DNA test to prove she's Indian or not it's just silly and stupid\nAnd Trump responding to her calling her Pocahontas just silly and stupid the whole thing silly and stupid and so I didn't talk about it I didn't want to talk about it I got angry because people wanted me to talk about it and I said instead I said you know what matters\nThat this issue does it matter what the hell does this matter for why we talking about this this doesn't matter what matters what matters is the bankrupt in the future generations that's what matters\nThe\nBeauty of Monday was both of these stories have Elizabeth Warren's DNA results\nAnd the federal budget deficit and jumping to the highest it's been since twenty twelfth the think about that from that just think about that jocks the position they're\nTwo major stories hit on Monday\nAnd everybody covered the first\nCovered Elizabeth Warren's DNA results and every body except this show ignored the huge jump in the deficit\nThing\nWhat does that say about us as a country\n...\nWhat does that say about us as a people\n[noise] [noise] right [noise]\nIt says to me\nThat a country more interested in\nMuch of an Indian Native American Elizabeth Warren is a nation more interested in that then a
