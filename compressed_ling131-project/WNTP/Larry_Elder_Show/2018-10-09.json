I mean Trump in his administration they generally wait until the facts are known and you know what you know what they react\nThe way most fair minded Americans white black and brown should react whenever there's a police shooting okay are cops are doing the best they can write let's find out what happened right I'm going to give the ... the benefit of the doubt because they're out there on the front lines doing the best they can do and stuff you and I won't do\nThat's the tone that Trump has said that's the tone that\nJeff Sessions Trump's attorney general do you remember how critical Eric Holder was of our cops oh my\nGod and our cops knew that Jeff Sessions has been an absolute warrior for our men and women and blow this wasn't the first time today this was about to\nAuthor fifth time that Donald Trump spoke in front of an audience of cops today he was down in Orlando, Florida speaking to the international association of chiefs of police look there's a reason\nAnd and I understand there's politics and everything every move Trump makes his political every move Obama made was political every move George W I get that right everything's political\nBut Trump dictates this\n... and and Trump is ... the law down\nThat he wants the American people to know without a doubt that this administration his administration will stand with our cops and defend our cops and he said it all again today\nHe went out of his way to say things that Brock Obama would never say in fact you know what Brock Obama generally never stood in front of an audience of police chiefs or police officer so it wasn't his thing\nWasn't really comfortable with it and it was not a priority for him\nAnd you you can you can give me the reasoning or the rationale for Trump and his administration it is a priority down in Orlando today\nA\n... and when he speaks to like today at a an audience of police chiefs from around the country\nYou know again everything that every president says he's generally speaking to the American people as well so again it makes a difference listen to what the president said give me a truck number\nTwo this year we proudly celebrate the one hundred and twenty fifth anniversary of the international association of chiefs of police great group today I said before you as president of the United states to tell you that my administration will always honored cherish and support\nThe men and women in blue and we are proud to do\n[noise] simple words straightforward words but words I never heard Brock Obama\nAutor never give me ... number three\nWorking together we have received extraordinary progress in the fight against a violent crime we understand that reducing crime begins with his respecting law enforcement for too many years we ever watched politicians escalating political attacks\nOn our courageous ... police officers and I've never seen it more than over the last few years is disgraceful\nListened to that Trump today reducing crime begins with respecting police officers it begins with respecting cops again\nJust never\nOrder the eight years before Trump never ever\nIt was all you know what cops need to understand the community\nCops need to do a better job of relating to the community cops need to reform the way that they deal with the community on and on and on a it was like Obama always put the onus the burden right to burn Obama always put the bird and we got a problem in this country right in too many of our\nUrban areas we got a problem between folks on the street and cops and when Obama looked at that problem Obama always put the burden on the responsibility on the cops to improve that relationships the cops have got to improve they've got to change they've got a reformed they've got to get their act together to improve that relationship\nNo Trump comes out and says hey you want to improve the relationship between cops and the community well it starts by the community respecting cops\nThe onus on you and me\nThe onus on the American people respect cops start their respect cops you want to die I Want you want cops to better understand your community stark their respect cops

some deserted island somewhere\nI mean everybody gave their apologies though and enforce a hill high school or they apologized and and uh they apologize to Brookhaven the entire community Brookhaven can't believe we did it I I\nI I guess the explanation was\nA that the high school students in the band\nWere inspired by the movie John Chu a two thousand and two movies starring Denzel Washington in which a father holds staff at a hospital hostage to get a heart transplant for his dying son\nNot what in God's name that has to do with high school football I I don't know\nThe incident is being

killed\n\nThese were all young couples a local police said these were all young couples\nMost of whom had just got married and they had their whole lives ahead of them\n\nOne gentleman lost four daughters\nJust stay horrific scene and even a law enforcement and transportation officials who are familiar with crashed sites and scenes like this are said this was just terrific\nUh never ever have they seen a ... an automobile accident like this with so many people killed\n\nAnd then it turns out that the um\nThe limousine or\nWas not in the best of shape fillers to limousine had problems one of the passengers in limousine texted her friends moments before the crash and said this limo with Iraq\n\nThe limo failed inspection just last month the driver did not have the appropriate license it

this limousine company is going to be in a lot of heat a lot of hot water a\nMad appropriate paperwork not appropriate license that they didn't pass inspections Phyllis goes on\n\nBut I just keep thinking about how uh\nWe're what we're twenty eight twenty nine days away from the mid term election\nA big mid term election [noise]\nA midterm election that is going to decide how much of the direction this country's gonna head\nOr an emotional mid term election uh\nUh being fought right now in an extremely divided country I Would say in irrevocably divided country and I would say this

we are fighting over basic founding principles that's what we're doing\nBut all of us\nNeed to pause every now and then and I don't know about you I don't know what you did this weekend but when I saw that headline this weekend I went\nWhoa I went whoa stop\nTwenty people in a limo were killed in one accident twenty people in a limousine\nAnd that takes your breath away\nAnd then when you find out

[noise] I mean the NFL TV ratings are down a\nTicket sales are down ESPNs ratings are still down\nI think there are a lot of Americans who've decided\nThat they can spend their Sunday afternoons\nOr in a much more enjoyable fashion\nAnd look I I can tell you about me\nOr there was a day when I just loved football\nAs a kid I played football\nFlubbed football\nOr watch college football religiously
