forty two percent that's pretty good the actual number was thirty eight percent sixty two percent felt that ah Chris Cuomo was the more biased reporter imposed against President Trump here's one for tonight and I'll give you the results tomorrow\nPresident Trump's presidency is now almost two years old if you voted against Trump\n\nA couple of ways to approach these mid term elections if you're in the conservative media world right now\n\n[noise] something's going on\nOkay like everybody in this business knows that the Democrats are fired up\nEverybody on Fox News knows the Democrats are fired up and they've been fired up for a long\nTime every conservative talk radio person who you listen to they know that the Democrats have been fired up ever since Donald Trump got elected they're angry there fired up ready to go vote we all know that\nAll the data shows that all the evidence shows that\nSo we can either tell you that\n\nWe can ignore the the ... the blue wave because we know most to you don't want to hear about the blue wave I mean look I I've got everybody most conservative radio shows they've got people from across the political spectrum who listen\nSo I got Democrats I got independence I got liberals I got conservatives that got Republicans I've got everybody in between who is listening to me right now but most of the people listening to me right now are Trump supporters most of the people who listen to conservative talk radio they are\nRepublicans slash conservatives\nAnd if you're a conservative radio talk show host\nWell you've had to make a decision are you going to be straight with your listeners\nAre you going to tell them that if the evidence is clear that data is clear Democrats are fired up their voting at a much higher percentage than Republicans have been voting in every ... special election and in every primary election students since Donald Trump became president am I going to tell my listeners that\n\nOr am I going to ignore that and kind of jet Li lie to my listeners 'cause I Know they don't want to hear about the blue wave\n\nNow speaking for me it's it's easy\nIt's it's a it's a decision I never have to make because I just tell you what I think I ... that's the only way I Know how to do radio I tell you the honest to God truth as I see it which is why\nSo many view now that we're three to four weeks away from the mid term so many of you have grown very tired of me from the beginning\nTalking about the blue wave I didn't want to fool yeah I didn't want to deceive view\nOr so I started talking about the blue away from the very beginning because I saw the way from the very beginning by the way let me interject here everybody knows a blue wave is common\nThe question is how big is it going to be is it can be big enough to take back the Senate is it can be big enough to take back the house and it's not how many seats in the house is the blue wave going to produce everybody knows that a blue wave is come and the question is how big is it going to be\n\nBut see I've had another motive all of these days and all of these weeks talking about the blue wave I talk about it because I Believe it I see it I've seen that for the past Eighteen months\nBut I talk about the blue wave is well I talk about how fired up and angry the Democrats are as well because I Want most of you to get fired up\nI I Know that most people listening to me right now like me you're a conservative like me you don't want the Democrats to take back the house in the Senate\nSo I've been ringing the siren\nEvery day every week I've been Paul Revere\nEvery day every week the Democrats are common the Democrats are common because I Want you to rise up I Want I don't want this wave however big it's gonna be I don't want this wave to defeat us I Do not want the Democrats to take control of the house or the Senate\n\nAnd so I've been trying to wake people up\nTo the fact that the Democrat vote is up over Ninety four percent\nThis primary season over twenty fourteen the last ... terms the Republican vote is only up twenty percent that's a big difference Democrats are fired up and they'd been boating\nAnd if our side doesn't get fired up and come out and vote\nIn November six we will most certainly lose the house\nAnd struggle in the Senate\nSo look everybody else you listen to on TALK radio and everybody you watch on Fox News or they got their own reasons for doing what they do for telling you about how fired up Democrats are or for ignoring that\n'cause they know you don't want to hear it and feeding you the bull about the red wave the new that smoke about the red white and look\nI've even heard guys like Kennedy and I and other people and Fox News who had been poop pulling the blue wave up until about two weeks ago\nAnd now all of a sudden you've got Hannity talking about oh my God we got to get out there and all that at all yeah them out there is a ... common these Democrats man they're fired\nUp so even Hannity even got people on Fox News or who who have done their level best these last Eighteen months to ignore what spent in front of them because they don't want to turn you off\nNow even they're forced to acknowledge the reality that\nThe Democrats will be coming out in droves this November the only question is will\nRepublicans will conservatives again this is a\nThis is a really easy decision for me to make because radio is really easy for me to\nDo all I Do I got this this microphone and all I Do\nIs say exactly what I Believe every single night\nA writer ... every word I order through this microphone is what I Believe and when you just say what you believe it's really easy you don't have to think about what you're going to say right\nYou don't have to calculate you don't have to strategize oh my God what am I going to what am I going to say that my listeners today how am I going to present this no it's easy I just say what I Believe every single\nDay and I believe in my head and I believe in my heart that the Democrats are in fact\nA dirty for war and they're going to come out and vote this November in droves and the only question mark\nIs will Republicans will conservatives\n[noise] now I understand something um what Hillary Clinton said yesterday that the days of civility are over and a lot of people on our side got bothered by that or I'm going to\nPlay you a little bit of Eric Holder from the other day Eric Holder was at a campaign event in Georgia\nAnd he pretty much said the same thing and I'll play that for you in a minute Eric Holder told a room full of Democrats baby or when when uh when when when it's time for the Democrats to be like the Republicans it's time for the Democrats to kick\nA and steel and do whatever we have to do to win\n[laughter] no no no more this when they go ... low we go high business a thank you very much Michelle Obama Eric Holder told the Democrats when they go low we got to go lower I played that for you in a minute and Eric Holder\n\nIs sort of getting abuse from our side like Hillary Clinton got abuse or from our side yesterday when she said you can't be civil anymore\nI don't know what the big deal is this is just further evidence that the Democrats\nAre fighting back you understand that our side one\nIn twenty sixteen right our side we got our guy in the White House our side controls the house our side controls the Senate we just got to good conservatives on the United States Supreme court ah we've been fighting a and we'd been winning\nAnd the only thing that's going on right now is the Democrats are fighting back\nWhat's the big deal about that uh there should be nothing surprising about what Hillary Clinton said yesterday or or Eric Holder said last night the Democrats are fighting back as well a reminder of how\nFired up they are and the question is\nWill our side be fired up enough to defeat\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd I I Would just argue I put it in front of you again everybody\n\nThere is no better motivation in the world than anger\n\nAnd the Democrats have it\nBanned when Eric Holder said what he said and Hillary Clinton said what she said forget about what they said look at the reaction every Democrat said hell yeah\nWhen they go low man we kick them when they go low we punched him Democrats are fired up make a make no mistake about it let me go to Chris Chris [noise]\n[noise] well eight Joe first of all thanks for taking my call that her and I walked away from the Democrat Party and if any Democrat tries to kick me I happened to be going to take my conceal carry class this week and I say bring it on but in in regards to the store right being\nUpset about what Hillary and Mr holder said over the last couple of days yes it is what I'm gauging from this isn't so much that they're anybody's irate but they do take some ... with the fact that they're\nThat they're saying that uh\nThey they're somehow they previously somehow being classy about the situation which they clearly habit I've never seen anybody on the right encourage us to go out and ... people in public places are abused people which they've been doing for an extended period of time so all of a sudden they're saying oh we're going to do this right well\nYou know you haven't done it right up to this point so forgive me for not buying or be asked\nNo no and Chris I'm not saying that they've been saying just before this all I'm saying this Trump is no saint Trump is now of course now Trump's Trump's not a civil guy he is and that so be\nAnd why voted for exactly and all I'm saying is the Democrats have reached that realization that they really need and that so beat even try to compete with them and and and and\nAnd that's absolutely the truth but they when they tried to say that they've been there trying to pass themselves off as having previously been saints which clearly know that\nThere there are a crutch thanks there are no shame on either side [laughter] and let's be real guys\nVery little civility on either side this is what a divided country looks like [noise]\nRevolution\nHas been reloaded [noise] you're listening to the Joe Walsh

everybody who stepped up with the contribution but do you ever wonder why I Am so strongly urging you to help\nIt's because of alliance defending clients like Kelvin Cochran the Atlanta fire chief who lost his job for a starting a men's Bible study in his off duty hours in his voice you can literally here\nUm his strength of character\nI Would gladly lay down my life in service to save another life because that's what firefighters do the one thing we should not have to sacrifice is our God given freedoms the\nFreedom of speech and the freedom of religion these freedoms for which so many in our nation have sacrificed suffered in that we shouldn't be forced to surrender\nThat I Know you agree with chief Cochran or and alliance defending freedom is fighting on his behalf but alliance defending freedom is providing free legal support\nTo chief Cochran there defending him they're fighting for him for free and they do this with everybody who's religious beliefs are under attack\nAnd I will say this again I've said this a whole bunch\nBoth sides have their ... jobs both sides have their extremes on both sides have they're bad people\nBut there is a difference the left in this country generally gets more violent the less politically the left\nIn this country they riot they loop they harass they get violent much more than the right did I I'll tell you what those eight years that

restaurant that is also mob like behavior\n[noise] I don't know why this is even a debate but listen to this That's Matt Lewis saying you know look I'll call out my behavior on our side but when you were rash Ted Cruz and his wife inside of a restaurant that's mob\nBehavior\nAnd then Don Lemon said this\nIs why I Can't make it if you gave it interrupting me up but you know you're in you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you are giving a liberal moderator and the whole subject that you're giving my\nI'm saying is that I'm like look up the word mob and the dictionary\nDon Lemon then proceeded with is\nBy definition you're not the word mob and the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the concert I mean I never felt and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest yeah and it doesn't say where you can\nJoin the fans are evil will you please let\nUs [noise] and then finally Don Lemon\nAnd you can do whatever you want and you can leave the show if you want but let me finish I'm not well maybe my point okay well been shut up and let me do it\nAll right thank you very much in the constitution you can protest whenever and wherever you want it doesn't tell you that you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a football field [laughter]\nTo tell you that you can't do it on a cable news shows and you can do it wherever you wanted to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the pale\nThis is really important to understand\nAnd you need to understand this time limit on CNN he's a man of the far left and last night on his show he said that people have a right to harass other people in restaurants ... a\nA Don Lemon said that uh\nYou can chase people into a restaurant and you have a constitutional right to do that a Don Lemon said it is not illegal to protest in restaurants\nDon Lemon said the constitution doesn't say people cannot protest in restaurants\nAnd I want you to understand this because this is how they think they're wrong okay you can protest America is all about protests but you can't protest anywhere and everywhere\n... what I what I Want you to do here is understand their mindset and the left believes it's perfectly OK to walk into a private business to walk into a point even establishment a restaurant and protest\nThat's wrong and every body listening to me right now should know that that's wrong yes hello yes you have a right to protest in America but you do not have a right to walk into somebody's business\nAnd protest inside that this is you don't have that right oh you're breaking the law that's called trespassing you will get arrested and the fact that this on CNN Don Lemon does not understand that\nShould concern everybody the fact that Don Lemon doesn't understand that yeah you got a right to protest um but that restaurant owner has rights too\nAnd everybody eating dinner in his restaurant they've got rights to\n\nI Want to tell you something what Don Lemon said last night\n[laughter]\nThat it's perfectly okay\nA group of eight to nine and teeth a left is too\nWalk into a restaurant in Washington D. C. and harassed the customer the fact that Don Lemon believes they have a right to do that now that damn scary the fact that he believes that the fact that the left believes that\n\nIf you are a Democrat listening to me right\nNow I Hope you understand the difference\nI Hope you understand that you got a right to protest outside that restaurant but you don't have a right to walk into that restaurant and protest and if you do you're going to get arrested and you should get arrested you've broken the law your trust bats and\n\nThe people inside that restaurant have rights\nBut where we are right now that's the lesson today where we are the left either doesn't understand that or won't recognize that this is a guy who's got his own show on CNN\nAnd he doesn't understand the constitution and he doesn't understand the law\nAnd look you and I don't watch Don Lemon on CNN and generally conservatives don't watch Don Lemon on CNN but a bunch of lives do a bunch of left these do and they they they all ... their head they all heard last night that it's perfectly OK to follow a politician into a restaurant and to harass\nHim the constitution protects my rights to do that\nThat's the scary stuff\nFalls\n\nProblem Steve is nobody called the police and so crews and his wife left but yeah hey thank you brother yeah no need for a new law [laughter] there's a lot in the bucks\nYou know that I Know you know that Steve there's a lot in the ...\nIf I don't want a restaurant if I got a restaurant you know nobody can just come inside my restaurant and protests I'm calling the cops and you're getting your ass or said\n\nThe problem is we're not fighting back against this\nCrap\nAnd I would tell every business owner listening to me politician listening to me\nThey crossed that line\nThey crossed that free speech line they crossed that freedom of assembly line\nNail them call the police\nThis will continue to get increasingly dangerous\nWe got three to four weeks to go before the selection don't know what's going to happen this election and then there's going to be a rock is presidential election two years later this country's divided or we're not unite the baby were divided and we're going to get more divided by the day the week the month a year [noise]\nBetter ...
