goes against every report after goes against our intelligence goes against Turkish intelligence goes against the audio evidence ... and ... [laughter] I I\nHope you know this is there is there's audio of could show he's killing and its audio that we've seen\nIts audio that our secretary of state Mike Pompeo has listen to it's probably all the audio ... that President Trump is listening to its audio evidence that proves\nWithout a doubt that when the show he entered that consulate he was immediately grabbed by about six to seven Saudis they threw him in a room they tortured him\nThey cut off all of his fingers while he was alive they tortured him brutally and then they killed him brutally and then they be headed him and dismembered him all carried out by a team of Saudi agents\nLook does it matter what the Saudis said no\nOr will it change anything no ah the world will move on and the United states of America will move I\nI I have no doubt that when Mike Pompeo flew out there last week I Know ... it was a good guy is a tough guy I have no doubt that when palm pale met with the crown prince he said uh listen uh my my bud ... and my friend are you guys need to come up with something there\nNeeds to be an announcement or you need a story you need to tell the world what happened\nAnd you don't have a lot of time ... pay always shoot that threat earlier this week he told the Saudis you need to put something out we know the guy was killed we know you all killed them there needs to be a story you need to put\nSomething out\nAnd here we are at the end of the week with their story\n\nThey look if you're disappointed in palm pale and the Trump Administration for not being sufficiently outraged by what happened to this Washington Post reporter\nI\nA Trump\nDoing with Saudi Arabia\nBomb I did with Saudi Arabia what George W. Bush did with Saudi Arabia what Bill Clinton did were Saudi Arabia what George W. Bush Bush did with Saudi Arabia what Ronald Reagan did with Saudi Arabia here's the deal right we we ignore\n[laughter] and so many people don't realize how cruel and oppressive Saudi Arabia is\nYou know we think of like a Islamic foreign countries and Islamic state run countries and you know we we we all we think of ISIS and and and al ... these terrorist organizations we think of Iran we think of a marsh and Saudi Arabia is always overlooked and people don't realize how evil and brutal\nSaudi Arabia's but we do business with them and they're a business ally and so because of that and generally because we needed their oil that's the bottom line\nWe've desperately needed their oil we've let them do what they do we've overlooked lot we've overlook the fact that Fifteen\nThe Nineteen nine eleven terrorists were Saudis we overlook a lot\n\nWe we ... we purposely the United states does what Trump did the last couple of weeks that's not unusual that's what every American presidents done\n\nOverlook and not make a big deal about\nHow evil the Saudi royal family is we overlook that purposely to do business purposely for their oil we overlook\nPurposely the fact that Saudi Arabia is is basically one of these Muslim run countries that still living in the seventh century\nRight again and I know they don't they don't get the rap like Iran and everybody else does and all the all the Muslim terrorist organizations out there running around out there but you know you know that Saudi Arabia leads the world and beheadings every year\nNot even close Saudi Arabia be heads more people than any other country or terrorist organization in the world it was just this past year that Saudi Arabia or agreed to consider letting women drive and uh\nAnd walk on accompanied by a man in public you didn't know that you didn't know that in Saudi Arabia women have not been able to leave the house by themselves\n[noise]\nThere's a lot people don't know about Saudi Arabia\nSo look I think this issue will go away what happened to show be sadly is not surprising this is what Saudi Arabia does there an evil seventh century Muslim regime\nPlain and simple with a lot of money with a crap load of money\nBut people are killed people are knocked off people are brutalized and tortured in Saudi Arabia all the time you can't be a dissident Saudi Arabia you can't be could show geeks and criticized the royal family in Saudi Arabia or you're going to be dead\n\nAnd this explanation that the Saudis put out it'll be enough the United states will move on in the world will move
