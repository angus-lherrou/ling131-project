day I don't know that I've said it in a while so let me say it loud and proud as I start with you this evening CNN sucks\n\n[laughter] I mean here's the thing about it [noise] ... let me can I just sort of set the table for all of us and and I hope you've had a good day here we are a day after or two or three days after we're now we're up to ten or bombs that have been sent in packages\nOr to the ... the former vice president Joe Biden or today actor Robert Deniro got the exact same bomb so we're up to ten packages set and this story really broke yesterday right\n[noise] I don't want to tell you something or just so we're clear it may be you know something I don't know we don't know who's behind all these bombs right I Want to make sure we're on the same page nobody listening to me right now no issues behind all ten of these bombs\n\nAnd I know nobody at CNN knows I don't know\n[noise] so that's where we are okay that's where we are right now is I come on the air with you right now this Thursday uh again that's the latest more packages discovered this morning\nA but we ... and the FBI and the authorities and law enforcement the N. Y. P. D. they are all over they're investigating we're going to find out sometime pretty doggone soon who's behind all of this but we don't know now show so so that's where we are\nSo all of last night and all of today member we don't know who's who's done this yet we don't know who's behind this but all last night and all today\nCNN has display the cry on [noise]\nYou don't want to cry on is is that like ... it said headline at the bottom of the screen when you watch in like the news caster or you're watching the talking head\nAnd at the bottom of the screen they've got some wording that says something some sort of key point that they want to get across will all night last night and all day today\nCNN has had the same damn cry on\nUp the same damn headline up and it says the following word for word\nQuote Trump has no plans to claim any responsibility for inciting the serial bomber\nCNN has put those words out there on screen ever since this story hit Trump has no plans to claim any responsibility for inciting the serial bomber\nToo which I say why the hell surety why should the CNN you suck I mean think about this right now we don't know who did it CNN\nRight there with that headline they are implying no you know what forget that word implying there saying that Trump's behind Trump is responsible Trump is responsible for these ten bombs now these ten packages\nThat's what that headline is saying ... I mean Trump has no plans to claim responsibility why that\nClearly CNN\nDemanding that President Trump claimed responsibility for inciting the serial bomber\nStop a minute why should he said you don't have to be a fan of Trump to ask that question [laughter] you don't\nHave to be a fan of Donald Trump to wanna watch CNN upside the head right now why should Trump claim any responsibility for the serial bomber why should he\nWe don't know who did that we don't even know yet who did it\nWhy should President Trump claimed responsibility for something he knows nothing about he doesn't even know who the guy is none of us do I I mean we\nOh no we don't even know if this guy who did this is a Trump supporter we don't\n\nWe don't and I get mad at anybody right or left who says I Know who's behind this I Know it was a Trump supporter no you don't I Know Joe this was all false flag operation no you don't\nBut I don't want to get into that again I Want to hammer CNN upside the head they're demanding that Trump claimed responsibility for this we don't even know if the guy who did it's a Trump supporter\nWe don't know if the guy who did it is just some crazy whacked out dude who doesn't even know who Donald Trump is\nWe don't know Jack understand the point I'm trying to make here CNN is so damn biased\nThey're criticizing Trump before they even know who's responsible for this I mean I can see you know if it turns out that this guy was a rabbit Trump supporter\nAnd he he was glued to every single word he a Trump said and and he took Trump literally when a Trump said that uh uh uh Joe Biden's bad dude and John Brennan's bad dude and Eric Holder's bad dude we don't know any of that yet\nIt would be one thing if CNN waited\nBefore they demanded Trump's claim some responsibility we don't know yet if this guy is a Trump supporter we don't know yet if this guy is just a crazy whacked out dude and we fundamentally don't know if the guy who did this was actually incited\nBy Trump at all we don't know my God\nYou know I wrap Trump upside the head because you should never called the media the enemy the people but man you can say until the cows come home that CNN sucks in so many of these media outlets sucked and and I I Would love to and I know you wouldn't want to do this I'd love to\nI'd love to sit Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo and Jake Tapper and all of 'em down for like an hour and just show them this and just ask them the question why did you put that headline on your TV screen all night last night and all day today\nDemanding that Trump claimed responsibility when we don't even know who did it yet hey guys\nDon't do you understand why so many Americans no longer like or trust a damn words you say do you get it\nTo get it now\nBut there were plenty of examples last night and today plenty of examples of people in the media and people on the left\nAssigning blame the President Trump for what happened yesterday and today and for all we know there could be more bomb packages found tomorrow\nThis one here though stood out and I think it\nIt ... in in real stark terms the bias\nThe ugly biased the dangerous by the media and I want to tell everybody listening to me right now who doesn't even like Trump and you don't support Trump I Hope you can understand how unfair this is like again\nIf we find out every body that the person who did this was a big Trump supporter Andy did it because he was inspired\nBy Trump will then that's one thing and then you know CNN puts up their cry on their headline hey hey hey now that we know this guy was inspired by Trump is when is Trump can claim a little bit of responsibility I still have a hard time with that but I understand it but to put this\nCry on up\nOn your TV screen all day before you even know who committed this act\nYou are revealing CNN dangerously biased you are the fact that you have so little self awareness\nThat you can't see that there's a problem with is demanding Trump claims responsibility\nBefore we even know who did it\nSay ... what will happen do you think to CNN if\nIf it turns out that it is some crazy leftist who did this if it was some sort of a false flag operation right to make the right look bad who knows right how how how bad is stupid and silly is CNN and all the rest of\nI'm going to look [noise] let me just say one more time 'cause it makes you feel [noise] and then you\n[noise]\nIt is Steve they keep it up all day they keep that up at the bottom of the screen all day they do that for a reason\nPeople turn on CNN people walk by TV people are at the airport people at the airport walking or you know walking through a\nWalk into the gate and they look it up at the TV and their CNN on and they seem to cry on at the bottom of the screen they don't really hear what the talking heads saying but they see at the bottom of the screen Trump has no plans to claim any responsibility for inciting serial bomber there is a reason why\nCNN puts it up there and keeps it up there like that\nLook\nYou can't say enemy the people but I Will say and I've said it a million times before the best thing Trump has done is exposed the media I really do believe that his greatest [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nTime to check the more freedom voicemail when you're saying about you oh my God how\nJoe on the side go\nDemocrat to send all these so called expert

control of this of the English\nA fairly extensive investigation right or with to late breaking news uh the sexual assault allegations\nMade by Dr Christine Blasey Ford against Kavanaugh\nWould you know it ... all of a sudden Michael ... he came in and out by the way he's like everywhere guy dude wants to run for president as well or he came out of nowhere with\nRight member a I got another woman or two or three\nOr that has some serious allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and ... uh sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee demanding the Judiciary Committee or look into the claims of one his client one Julie sweat neck\nGrassley today said you know what we're going to look in the microwave oven I\nWe think he lied to us we think he lied to this committee we think he did it to purposely obstruct what the Senate Judiciary committee was doing those are crimes a Grassley refer them both to the Justice Department today\nI'm In a letter to the attorney general Jeff Sessions\nUm the letter notes again three potential violations a criminal violations\nUm ah ah ah offenses of conspiracy false statements and obstruction of Congress\nAre all a would be a crimes so we'll see ... and ... like again I Do believe that we are to investigate I don't want to bring up a bunch of old Kavanaugh stuff\nBut I Love the fact now they're going after ... because I think he did some dirty messy business but I Love for somebody maybe at least a a a Senate committee somebody has to investigate\nOr what why the dams held on to that a bombshell information for so long and then who leaked it who leaked it again I don't want to revisit the whole Kevin offing but remember Dr Ford never ever ever want to go public\nSo adding Dianne Feinstein needs to be looked into as well but we'll take them one at a time this is one good thing we're going to look into ... the Justice Department is going to look into whether ... he lied to Congress and tried to obstruct their investigation or that's great stuff\nMight got any thing is viable but we'll find out I don't believe anybody who tells you they know hey Josh here I\nI I just feel that they can talk about the cry on the guy and I'm just saying\nIt's funny because they are that tight laws that meant that the trial a CNN would help me cry on the other thing so Trump hasn't come out today and I think it was thought well if yeah because the double their story yeah that yeah it would be to any other way\n[noise] you know hey Josh thank you my man thank you know look this is the situation we're in\nWe've been in a situation forever\nYou you uh take put Fox News over here put conservative talk radio over here\nGenerally all the rest of the media is on team Democrat you know that right and and Republicans and conservatives have always known that Trump is the first Republican president to fight back against that to push back against that\nI mean the media went after Reagan the media went after George W. Bush the media always goes after Republican presidents\nAnd the media generally again outside of Fox News and outside of conservative talk radio and by the way I don't want to let Fox News off the hook CNN and NBC and ABC and all of them are on team Democrat you know right that Fox News says in the tank for Trump pianist come on now\nCome on now be honest Fox News isn't absolutely on team Trump the differences well no that's not true and nobody really admits they're biased they're all biased\nThrow all biased but I just it's like\nIt's like with the Mueller investigation to me everybody

horizon involving our religious freedom our founding fathers recognized that all people have in alien ... writes that flow from the creator\nAs secular forces chip away at our nation's Judeo Christian

marriage is between a man and a woman it unacceptable so it it tolerance even though it should be a two way street often in these instances ah it's not and I think that's the danger and\nSo we got what ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen thousand people\nAre walking making their way up to our southern border and actually some some news was made today but\nIt's it's news with some caution I got to be honest because we've been here before we haven't had a caravan vis big but we've been here before they're been caravans law last caravan was at the end of April early may about a thousand\nAnd you know where those thousand are now those thousand that came to our southern border back in April May there in America\nOkay we've been here before we got to change the way we do things but a couple of pieces of good news when it comes to this caravan\nThe Trump Administration announced today that eight hundred a active duty soldiers will be sent to the border the troops will be sent to the border of via Fox News ... ... troops number one\nSecretary Mattis is expected the sign deployment orders later today authorizing hungry and so there's some truth to the southern border\nThese images so some of the national guard troops had earlier that hair by the president has said she'll tell facts at least eight hundred additional active duty troops are part of a new force heading to the southern border the request for assistance from VHS came last night that request happen that line of October thirtieth\nSo eight at least eight hundred troops by October thirtieth will be put on the border or they're not infantry but there'll be down there for a reason give me troops number two\nThings that composition of the term ... determined athletes state by the joint staff here at the Pentagon they will not be infantry transcend will only the arm for self defense\nAnd who are they and what are they going to do gimme troops number three\nThey are engineers lawyers and medical personnel according to a Pentagon official and will be there and Leslie test support the customs and border patrol\nThere'll be down there these eight hundred and some are active duty soldiers there'll be down there to assist homeland security on the border there'll be down there to assist don't forget we got about Twenty one hundred or twenty two hundred and National Guard troops down on the border dead and give me troops number for\nNot immediately clear where the forces will be going along the border but we'll be providing supporting role they will not be making rats how important\nThis is a good move visiting important move it's a necessary move see what we have to try to do and I'll get to the other piece of news today in a second we have to try to do is keep this caravan\nFrom getting to our border let's be honest and let's be real the thought of the image of ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen thousand of these folks at\nBorder or is in image that scares the heck out of the Trump Administration and it should because again remember this past April\nYou just had almost a thousand of them camped out on our border\nAnd then the TV cameras descended on them and then you had the women and children and you had these babies cry and then you add these folks given their their their their legit sob stories and before you knew with the Trump Administration backed down\nThe thousand or migrants were led into America all the claim asylum\nOr to seek asylum and they've been here ever since the Trump Administration is scared of that image those images\nImagine fourteen thousand of them\nSo to say you know what we're putting troops on our border yeah\nWhat will the troops do on the border that's not the point we're putting troops on the border so everybody in this caravan knows and soul Mexico knows we're putting troops on the border as a way to try to dissuade them from getting to our border\nAnd then there's the president himself who came out this afternoon in a tweet and tweeted and I quote\nTo those in the caravan turnaround we are not letting people into the United states illegally go back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing\nTwo points on this tweet by the president again same strategy as with the troops this tweet is meant to prevent these folks from getting door border the Trump Administration is going to try to do whatever they can do\nWith Mexico without Mexico\nTo try to get these folks to turn around now to make sure they won't get to our border\nAnd and I'm sure you will see in the next week or two so\nA more a respectful but tough warnings from the president to these people turn around\nAnd I heard somebody I'm I don't know what network or who said that that tweet of the president's was heartless and cruel\nYou kidding me oh you serious\nOr did he say again here's what the president said word for word to those in the care of and turn around we're not letting people in the United states illegally\nWhat's cold heartless about that somebody tell me we're not letting anybody into this country illegally what's cold heartless about that\nGo back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing what's cold and heartless about that\n\nIf you want to come to America apply to be a citizen what's wrong with that\nWhat you mean about that\nNot a damn thing by the way not a damn thing this is what again this is what I Want my president conveying this is what I Would like my president communicating to the whole world by the way really that tweet this tweet shouldn't go out to everybody around the world\nWe don't want in America now new rules for new rules nobody can come into this country illegally if you want to come to America\nGod Bless you do it the right way apply for citizenship like millions do every single year and that is the message that is the only message when it comes to immigration that the president of the United states should be delivering I'm ... I'm I'm Glad the president delivered it today\nAnd he's going to have to deliver it again because I'm telling ya in in a few weeks if you get ten eleven twelve Thirteen thousand at our border it's going to be a PR nightmare and one more reminder when that last caravan was heading up our way\nAbout a thousand or so and by the way you do know that there was another smaller caravan from El Salvador that's making its way up here\nIt's about Fifteen hundred two thousand so there is another caravan on the move and by the way we'll get to that in a second this is why you can't let anybody in 'cause if you let everybody from a caravan in what do you think's gonna happen another caravan back in April you may not remember this we didn't put troops at the border but back in April\nThe president of the United states put out a few tweets telling them\nRents to turn around telling the migrants that we would not let them in you need to know that you need to know the whole truth the president's done this before he did this before the last caravan he warned them we would not let them in they didn't\nListen to that warning they got to our border in California and the president backed down and they were led in to seek asylum and they're all here\nWe can't make that mistake again I'm Glad the president is sending this message again but they pay attention down there\nIn Mexico and Honduras Guatemala they pay attention to what a president does more than what a president says\nAnd when they saw everybody from the last caravan pretty much get into this country they said to themselves you don't need to listen to what that man says let's get up to the border let's find a CNN camera\nAnd before you know it will be in America\nThis time if if there is a this tax man this president has to back up\nEvery single word he's tweeting right now and when he says like the president said today we're not letting people in to the United states illegally\n[noise] boy she better carry through [noise] because if he does he less fourteen thousand of them and you're going to have a thirty four hours a day care [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWith a with a people come

people to take advantage of it or this asylum deal is one of them we can't let anybody in this country to claim asylum\nWe just can't we we are we ought to change that immediately people should have to claim\nAsylum or from their home countries how about we have right\n[noise]\nTime to check more freedom voicemail when you're saying about you oh wait\nA minute mark from Dallas\nAnd you got your caller and right now speaking about letting the women and children come in front of holding just remind them that that work so well last time\nMr President Trump was was was paying for that one as

every now and then you should you probably can ignore me\nI Know if you go on websites you're probably going on Fox News and and conservative websites I think you should go on a few websites that

ah I I Know what I\nBelieve and think about this\nGroup of ten to fourteen thousand people heading toward our southern border\nI Know what I Believe I knew what I think should be done\nBut to make sure that I can make the most compelling case I can make I Want to be aware of what the left believes we ought to do about the caravan where's their head on a on this and by the way I've been watching a lot of CNN and MSNBC\nAs they've in the last few days as as they've talked about the caravan\nAnd what's really interesting is the left than Democrats they don't have a position they're struggling\n\nWith their position with what they think we should do see that's a clue that's\nGood but I wouldn't have known that unless I paid attention to them our site it's pretty cut and dry here

do we lead in where do they stay do we how some\nWhich really interesting is on this one issue the left is struggling to find a position and I hear that every day and every night when I go to my left is Web sites and my leftist TV\nThey don't know how to respond to this and they're they're trying to feel their way through various stances\nNow that's pretty cool or it's pretty cool that I Know that that I found that out and I found that out kind of paying attention to that it's like I've got an inside of their uh their war room\nI'm I'm I'm paying attention to the left\nTrying to strategize on how best to fix this problem this issue they don't have a fix but the point is the point I'm trying to make care before I Move on this\n\nI'm inside their war room because I watch MSNBC every night and CNN every night I've got a decent idea of how my political enemies think because I go on a number of\nLefty websites every day I've got a decent idea of where my political opposition Ted is

you that right\nMy dad told me that\nAnd it's true so my advice\nAgain is push yourself push your beliefs challenge your beliefs\nPay attention to what the other side saying don't just in other words don't just listen to conservative talk radio and don't just watch Fox News that's what I'm saying [noise]\nBecause [noise]\nThousands of people over the last few years on this very issue conservatives Republicans Tea Party folk I've never heard of that kind of racist talk I've never heard that kind of bigotry [noise]\nLike like my opposition [noise] to allowing these people in is because of the color of their skin [noise]\nI've never heard that have you [noise]\nThose are the dogs up all American there you know what's off have you\nYou've got friends and you got family\nFamily members who are looking at this a caravan of people [noise]\nAnd and they're saying dang Lou dollars brown people we can't let them in because they're brown\nI've never heard that\nFrom anybody on the right\nSo my ah\nMy my underage grows and I I get really ticked off when I see headlines like this\nNicholas Kristof in the New York times it's not about immigration it's about\nBigotry that really angers me and I make a point that every time every time I Do I Apologize for the dogs they're uh they're right above me right now\nEvery time I saw it in a lift up my voice a little bit every time I hear this I feel compelled to call it out [noise]\nAnd I would encourage you to do the same [noise] you see if we if we if we don't respond\nTo charges of racism those charges stemming if you don't respond if you let it slide if you just turn the other cheek and move out in March on\nThem and by the way this is what a lot of us on our side tend to do because we backed out we're afraid nobody nobody wants to be called a racist\n[noise] nobody wants to be called a million\nSo uh\nWhen when those charges are made Republicans especially they tend to hide they tend to get quiet\nThey're so afraid of being
