{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "Of independent good to have you with this Bill Maher teams here fourteen minutes before the top of the hour we're getting some great news that uh the pastor in Turkey I'm Andrew Brunson is being released a middle of the state department's been working on this very vigorously along with our president and um\nWe just uh got news that he's been released after being held prisoner in Turkey for two years with us right now and I'm sure he's celebrating with the news as well is Geoff just and he's in issues analysts for focus on the family Jeff how you doing\n[noise] hey bill I'm doing great and um that is great news that uh that pastors being released\nYeah right now I mean wouldn't you know just as you and I are talking I mean this is a this is breaking news\nAnd uh we're excited uh we've been praying for pastor Brunson for quite a while you know as a most may understand he was being detained he was accused of being a terrorist or a ... but you know hey look at that's what happens in a ... you know countries outside of the United states that uh\nYou know or operate too with the power of the government to do is they darn well please and uh they come up with stories and next thing you know you're in jail and forget about any kind of freedom right\nYeah that's true and I'm probably like we're going to talk about this morning it's not happening here in the U. S. but a Christians are being accused here as not being extremist or um haters are big hits and\nUm but certainly we're yeah we're not in a place where they are overseas and other places where Christians are really being seriously persecuted\nWell I I mean on on some degree Jeff I agree with you they almost seems like a you know we are dealing with a hang male compared to what other questions that you see these others that had been persecuted ... I mean uh you you you read the voice of the martyr and you hear the stories that uh\nYou know true martyrs they're the faith or going through and um you know when you go gosh what are we complaining about\n'em and you know that's one thing but the other deal that's most concerning right now is the lack of civility the political environment is torching our culture\nAnd is creating a war and division amongst its people uh that is very dangerous that puts us on a road to a ... some of these countries have been doing we're just become so autocratic and I know it's hard for people to proceed that they were they said well this is America\nBut you know here we are politically talking about a socialism values and I'm just about every socialist country that I'm aware of a meal may say unintended but are they end up you know overpowering the people and try to get everybody to think the same way and forget about any kind of liberty\n[noise] that's right we see um [noise] yeah we see that around the world where they're trying to I'm\nCompelled speech to be a certain way and we even I'm seeing that here in the U. S. I Know in California I'm ... ... right at the Supreme Court struck down just in June I was trying to compel I'm pro life centers to tell their ...\nClients about abortion and direct them to abortion centers and so here you have the government here trying to compel speech and thankfully that was struck down\nMhm well and of course uh you know right before that and you got Dave the light and who are videotapes a Planned Parenthood or officials selling baby parts\nWhich I'm In every understanding of the law that I have is illegal\nAnd nothing happened to them But Dave delight and is the one who's being persecuted now he he was a detained he was put in jail\nHis legal fees are mounting and meanwhile the are the people associated with the sale of baby parts Planned Parenthood at all um are roaming around phrase if nothing happens so what does that tell\nYou what what is that telling you know people here in this country and around the world is that you better you know toe up to the party line if not we're going to make it a living hell for you\nYeah I I I think you're right I mean we could name case after case like that um jak Philips bake in Denver ... a ... in the forest in Washington I'm even chick fillet every time they try to build a new\nA restaurant um they're attacked and people are reminded that their president a few years ago came out in support of marriage between a man and a woman so\nAlong with along with almost eight well over eight million voters in California which by the way all those votes were vacated by the very uh ... ... you know Democratic Party that says well we gotta make sure every vote counts\nExcept for the you know again just like the sinking in speaking as long as it lines up with their politics it's okay but uh you know the heck with the first amendment and that we have any kind of contrary and you want to exercise the liberties or they were given to us by our U.S Constitution\nYeah I ... I think what it tells as one of the things that tells us is that um as businesses and government and the media um are more and more opposed to the Christian message on a\nLife and sexuality and relationships and marriage there are Christians need to be more and more on guard and um we do need to take a stand for a\nFree speech and freedom of religion and those those values that have been such a part of the the American um tradition and are you know what that caller American experiment here\nExactly what we do need to be on guard for those things and so Christians need to be active and and of course we want to do it um kindly and graciously but we still want to stand up and speak the truth and and do it courageously as well right\nExactly and people have faith need to understand hum\nForemost to all this is that you have to war you're up in by wiring up you've got a warrior up with those tools that are not carnal but the ones that are mighty\nThrough God and that is a course a resembles a for us uh you know in the full\nArmor of God if you are not an armored up with a full armor of God or\nYou're going to be insensitive or you're going to be a little bit of a club hopper here because after everything is all said and done ... you know what his pre eminent in our face is that we love one another and you know it's easy to love the lovable it's the young lovable that are the biggest you know the biggest challenge a chef you know\nYeah I Know Jesus Jesus warn us about that and and called us too it didn't he yes he did all of\nThose who persecute us and and and and I think people should be encouraged to because we have such great examples and people like Jack Philips and Baron Hill stats men who have been gracious are under pressure and they\nUm you know you were talking about the incivility they have not resorted to that kind of in civil language but they've been gracious and kind\nAnd thoughtful and they've expressed their viewpoint and I think I'm there can be encouraged because those are really really good models for us\nAnd Jeff uh especially encouraged not only by the owners but uh the employees you know when the chick fillet was attacked or the response of the employees were so godly I mean it was\nUm you know I was really proud of the employees in how they came together in trusted in their faith you know a lot of people I I mean the things that some of the customers were saying\nTo the people in challenging them I mean it was like they went out of their way to just to go ahead and ruin somebody's day in torment them\nUh but the response of the employees was admirable and um and I and I drew great courage from watching a ... and I mean these aren't you know these were young girls being attacked Jeff I'm now\nSo uh you know it's a sad commentary you know we talk about some of these businesses you know here we simply um in fact I'm heading to California tomorrow uh and of course one of my favorite stops as soon as I get there is in and out burger and for those of you know and it just comes with the west coast it goes with the west and are\nYou going to have it in and out burger and they were all upset because um you know in and out was supporting Republican causes right and and I had to laugh because I said gosh these knuckleheads looked at the bottom of the cup\nOf their drink and saw a a Christian scriptural reference this wouldn't blow their heads up on this but\nI Know I Know they're um you know\nClimbing the gospel and and large and small ways there but yeah and they make good burgers\nToo you know a very good [laughter] good hitter fries\nYeah exactly yeah we'll see there's a problem I tell people that they go well why did the French fries taste so different I said well because you've been used to McDonald's 'cause they bleep stir fries and a ... you know by the time you tasted it it's got it's got a unique taste I think on one hand marketing wise\nAnd you know quite innovative for McDonalds but on the other hand when you go and you actually have a real potatoes like to do it in and out you go well what is so different about well that's the way potatoes as opposed to taste it but they do you watch them\nTake those potatoes and split them up into fries and you know you're getting the real deal\nExactly exactly but you know to your point after all is said and done here Jeff is that yes Christians need to understand um hey we're in a culture war we are called to be defenders of the faith to be ready and any season\nYou know to tell your story you know what is that um that makes you so joyful and so excited what is it that happened in your life or that or you know causes me to think that I Want what you have right\nYeah I think we can be um\nYou know like our time at ... we can be gracious under that kind of pressure and display\nUm peace and joy in the midst of all the what seems to be chaos and instability around us and and a lot of that you know it's for mentored by the media and by different politicians and we don't necessarily experience it\nTime for some classical radio shows you know we're into October so that means scary radio shows and I have one for you to
