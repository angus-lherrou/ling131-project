month or two\nAnd this will probably continue these final three or four weeks before these mid term elections and and I'm trying to find out and figure out what I got more than what I can put in front of\nA every Republican and every conservative and every independence and every Trump supporter who's listening to me or that that that I can put in front of the wall that can convene shoe\nOr that we're in trouble this November unless we get off our asses then we got to get up up off our backsides now because there's something coming\nAnd and I don't know that I've done a real good job I don't even want to say the word is blue wave tonight and I'm not gonna but\nI'll tell you what if this doesn't make you sit up and think\nOh wow there is something going on this November we better get going we'd better get moving we'd better get work and we'd better get Bolton I'd better get everybody I Know of to vote if if it is today tonight doesn't get should doing it I don't know what will but I'll I'll Try to come into Morrow with something else\nUh is Scott Scott Walker ... in my mind are the most successful\nRepublican governor that we have in this entire nation\nAnd I apologize if I'm offending any other Republican governor throughout America but Walker would be at the top of my list Scott Walker right now Republican governor of the state of Wisconsin right now\nMany of you may not realize it because you know everybody's focused on Trump and we're really focused on the house in the Senate in D.C can we stop the Democrats from taking control of the house and Senate and it's going to be a battle especially in the house but you need to know\nAs you're heading home tonight\nOr you're still out on the road the night and you're still working the night whatever you're doing you need to know that\nThe the most successful if not one of the most popular Republican governors in the entire country right now as we speak is in the fight of his life [noise] and when you look at the\nPolls right now the Pauline right now coming out of Wisconsin right now if you're a Batman Governor Scott Walker is not going to win Governor Scott Walker believe it or not is down he's losing to somebody nobody's ever heard of Democrat candidate named Tony Evers\nDoesn't matter it doesn't even matter who Scott Walker's opponent is\nWhat you need to know in and this might surprise some of you\nKnow down down here in Illinois you know we we we have a Republican governor who's way down in the polls and there are Republican governors all over the country who are struggling to get reelected in this difficult year\nBut this ought to put\nThis ought to put some meat on the sandwich for you Scott Walker right now is down\n... unless something changes these final three or four weeks Scott Walker's probably gonna lose Scott Walker Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker he's been a damn successful governor he's got an unbelievable record\nAnd the state of Wisconsin may vote him out\nA couple of polls out today one poll NBC Marist Poll shows Walker down ten points\nAnother pull the Marquette polls show Scott Walker down a point in all the polls I've seen seven eight nine ten eleven the last seven eight nine ten eleven polls I've seen\nHave all said the same thing the racist clothes and Scott Walker is a little bit down I never look at any one poll you should never look at any one poll I Try to look at all of the polls the average of all of the polls and right now Scott Walker is down by a little bit\nThen that might surprise a lot of you but it shouldn't if you're paying attention right now politically to what's going on in this country it shouldn't surprise you\nTo make sure all the sense in the world we won in November twenty sixteen we won we won\nOur guy punched them in the face knocked them out we won\nHim the other side [noise] still can't\nWell for that the other side has not gotten over that\nBut the other side has spent the past Twenty one months regrouping and Rio organizing and figuring out how to fight back\nAnd they're doing it and they're doing it again I\nMean you look at polls all over the country what's happening to Scott Walker is happening to Republicans Republican members of the house all over the country and Republican governors all over the country\nThis Senate I think in large measure because of what happened to Brett Kavanaugh it looks like a number of the Senate races are coming home Tennessee\nAnd North Dakota and even Indiana a number of these are coming home but still some tough ones in the Senate\nBut when you think about a guy like Scott Walker\n\nTo think about all he's done staring down the unions all he's done when it comes to education reform all he's done when it comes to welfare reform and amazing record financially and fiscally\nIn the state of Wisconsin Scott Walker he's had an amazing run the last eight years\nAnd in an ordinary year\nMost common sense people in the state like Wisconsin should look at Walker look at his record look at the quality of the\nGuy he is saying they should get reelected but this is not an ordinary year and what is happening in Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's down right now\n... Wisconsin is kind of a purple state\nSome balance of Republicans and Democrats and independents\nFor Walker to be down that means one thing that means the Democrats are more fired up in the state of Wisconsin\nPlain and simple that means more Democrats are coming out to vote than they typically had come out to vote in mid term these are poles of likely voters so that means Democrats are coming out and they're coming out in the state of Wisconsin in pretty record numbers it's it's almost not even a reflection of Walker\n\nHistory tells us that this first mid term a is a tough mid term\nFor the presidents and for the president's party\nOn average the ... we lose on average I think in this first midterm after uh uh the president is elected you lose like an average thirty house seats and four or five Senate seats on average got nothing to do with Trump\nBut then on top of that you put Trump\nAnd the the the feelings we have for Trump\nDe ... you have for Trump the strong belief you happen what Trump's doing right you're fired up you're fired up you're fired up okay good\nWith the other side is the ads fired up in opposition to Trump\n\nAnd in the last Twenty one months they've been coming out to vote more than you and\nI have in this this doesn't change a good man\nAnd a really good governor like Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is going to lose [noise] I I wanted to put this in front of everybody listening to me tonight because I'm hoping it might jolt you all a little bit\nIf if Scott Walker's in trouble if Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is going to lose well then a lot of Republicans are going to lose\n\nWake up Wisconsin Republican's wakeup Wisconsin conservatives and independents who believe in fiscal sanity\nYou got three four weeks to try to save Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker you you've been warned\nAnd all of us outside of Wisconsin should take this warning and do what we can in our respective\nAreas [noise] to make sure we fight likes it it can get the public as well [noise]\nI'm Joe Walsh of going [noise]\nAre women with college degrees yeah you can do both heavily democratic and the other foreign industry according to this hour recalls looking at the big picture that helped Trump was the agricultural community\nBut with the terrorists now in China they're hurting and the Democrats are banking on the door with these these terrorists and they gave specific example yeah\nThe tractor highly highly is another one having a big menu and they're they're being ... out of European China because terrorists and people and their ... hitting that and they're going to get in touch with me I really appreciate you got a great show\nAs a male thank you man thanks thanks for checking in let me quickly get to Bryan before I hopped hey Brian you're on with Joe\nHow's it going I'm good man\nOkay so I'd have to say that it's a combination of Republicans that being strong enough right now and also Democrats are fired up\nYes here in Illinois\nMost certainly around or has it been as weak as anyone can get and that's why you see J. B. Pritzker almost twenty points ahead of him\n[noise] he ... you know Brian suffice to say we have our own unique issues and problems here in the state of Illinois that's why I wanted to put Scott Walker in front of everybody Scott Walker right now is in the fight of his political life um that should wake you up to the fact\nThat our side had better get moving we got three to four weeks to turn

vote to state will automatically registered to vote I don't think the states should be able to do that I don't think government should be able to do that\nAutomatically registered to vote what if you don't want to be registered to vote and again\nIf you're gonna get registered to vote go get yourself registered to vote\nYou remember ah what was it early September\n... California which has the motor voter program\nUm you you enter a DMV you get a driver's license you get that license renewed you're automatically registered and in early September a came out right hoops\nA California found that over twenty three thousand people were wrongly registered to vote\nAt the DMV\nWrongly registered to vote when they when the department of motor vehicles over twenty three thousand people\n\nCalifornia are delivered that groups in early September just two days ago California said oh we found another Fifteen hundred people that the state of California wrongly registered to vote\nSo now we're up to almost twenty five thousand people and I guarantee you in another week or two or three it'll be the same thing over more people bright right here in California other states have this in California the state automatically registered to vote\nAnd California is acknowledging Justin this last month they acknowledged two days ago that Fifteen hundred more people who went into the DMV\nWere wrongly registered that number's going to keep going up to your registering the state is registering people to vote who are not eligible to vote\nIllegal ... people in this country illegally and others ... and is it is it any\nSurprise that this was going on\nWhen the government automatically registered to people to vote is it any surprise\nThat the government's going to make some mistakes\nAnd register people to vote who are not eligible to vote and then if you play it out with me is it any surprise that these people vote is it any surprise right that there's voter fraud in California other states around the country would you at all be surprised that people who are in this country illegally and there are a\nHell of a lot of them out in California who are in this country illegally and now we're finding out there are a hell of a lot of people out in the state of California who are in this country illegally who have been\nRegistered to vote\nWhen they went into a DMV not not a surprise but again California like the state of Illinois like other states around the country\nNow give people in this country illegally driver's license is so ... what would you be surprised\nRight you've got a system like that more than a million and a half illegals in the state of California have secured California driver's license you do the math for me right about a million and a half illegals in California now have driver's licenses\nAnybody in California who goes into a DMV\nAnd gets a driver's license or gets their license renewed is automatically registered to vote\nDo the math do the math add\nUp data\nSpell voter fraud for me please spell people voting who are not supposed to be voting I mean that's what California acknowledged again this week when they [laughter] confessed to finding just two days ago\nCalifornia confessed to finding another Fifteen hundred people who are registered to vote\nWho shouldn't be registered to vote\nI guess in the internal audit was done of the department of motor vehicles this isn't a surprise and it shouldn't be the case but when you\nAllow the government I don't know\nWhen you allow the government [laughter] when you allow the government to give id and or driver's licenses to people in the country illegally you're gonna have fraud you gonna have problems [noise]\nAnd then when you decide that the government will automatically register anybody who gets a driver's license to vote automatically will register them to vote whether they want to be registered or not whether they're eligible to be registered or\nNot you're gonna have problems\nAnd California's having problems right now\nAnd and they're just fessed seen up to find dean maybe twenty five thousand illegals and others who [laughter] who the state\nAutomatically registered and and I don't know right if you're in this country illegally if you're not eligible to vote but you get this thing from the government that says you're registered to vote I don't know I Can't imagine some of them are gonna vote\n[noise]\nWe make it too easy\nNow now again I could spend two hours just telling you philosophically why I don't think we should make it easy for people to vote\nBut look at the problems\nLook at the corruption look at the fraud\nAnd I'm just picking on California today\nI could do with this with any of the states\n\nThis just seems like such a common sense issue to me\nAnd this just seems like an issue that Republicans ought to be hollering about every day\n\nI I don't know why some Republicans are afraid to say what I just said\nI mean that goes against my libertarian principles that we allow the government to automatically register people get out of my business to get out of my life if I Want to register I'll get myself registered don't you government automatically registered me\nBut California is registering a whole bunch of illegals to vote and I can guarantee you we got a lot of\nImportant race is a lot of important congressional races in three to four weeks in the state of California in fact many of these house races in the state of California will probably determine who will control the house I can guarantee you\nThere's fraud\nAnd there's going to be big time voter fraud in the state of California guaranteed I'm Joe Walsh I'm doing\n\nAll\nCable stay on the line resting and they'll give you the final word this is a tricky one because and let's talk about California in general\nMy solution would be to reverse what California did so I don't believe in motor voter a automatic registration I don't believe the state should automatically register\nAnybody devote so that would be a solution I don't believe the state should give people in this country illegally driver's licenses so my solution rusty and I know what's that can happen in California is I Would a reverse or what\nForty has done the last couple of years I'll give you the final word\nRoutes that's fair enough I I have not found and that's why we got the yes on\n... but rush the ... and I admit you got me on this one 'cause you and I know it's that can happen\nOr it can happen in California thank you brothers thanks for checking in a ... it's it's a good question rusty what is my solution right and again my flip answer is the solution is don't do a California did don't do it Illinois did\n\nDon't make it easy much my solution don't make it easy for people to vote in this country don't make it easy for people to register to vote I'm not saying don't make it I don't want to make it difficult but don't make\nIt easy and and for heaven's sakes do not give anybody\nIn this country illegally government issued id but data that that horse left the bar and a few years ago\n[noise] [noise] and it's time to check the mosh freedom voicemail when you're saying about you [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe don't have to\nMake it through or car which I doubt it will\nBe
