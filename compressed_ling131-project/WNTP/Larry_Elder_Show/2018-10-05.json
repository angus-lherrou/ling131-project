G.\nSo we were right [noise]\nYou and I were right\nAnd this was the last card that the Democrats had the play they play it it's oh for Brett Kavanaugh judge Brett Kavanaugh will be Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh we were right\nWe were right man we've travel ... miles this past week it's felt like a month and a half this past week but it was almost a week ago right the day after the hearing last week remember\nAnd everything looks like it's flying cars Brett Kavanaugh displayed so righteous anger or we can go\nAnd everybody felt great and everybody felt good and then and then the uh the Judiciary Committee meets\nLast friday morning they're all set to vote\nAnd San ... out of the committee to the full Senate and then Jeff Flake does his thing Senator Jeff flake said stop time out I'm not comfortable we do need to have a very brief FBI investigation no more than a week\nBut I think the country ... it'll be better for everybody in the country a judge Kavanaugh everybody\nNow is just so we can go and I remember going on there that friday and my thought was this is a good thing\nThis call for the FBI the CIA investigation it's a good thing it will make judge Brett Kavanaugh stronger it will make his nomination stronger and it will lead to when he gets approved\nAnd gets voted on the Supreme Court\nHe won't be in a much stronger position\nIn fact I said last friday Jeff Flake maybe this isn't why did it but [noise]\nJeff Flake did Brett Kavanaugh of big favor last week\nAnd most of us as we talked about last friday right well number one a day that was oh my God but we talked about it and I think a lot of you agreed as much as you know again we thought oh here we go again they're going to do why it's another delay tactics all the Democrats are trying to do is slow this thing down\nAnd is right as you are on what the Democrats have been trying to do here\nThe message I tried to get across last friday a week ago was that this is the last\nCard the Democrats had to play the FBI investigation it's this is all they've been calling for now the last three weeks so give it to him give them this bone give it to him\nLimited FBI investigation in scope limited the current and credible allegations bold no longer than a week you take that off off the off the table get rid of the investigation and the Democrats have\nNot seen last them praise the lord is that's where we are right now the FBI investigation was completed yesterday\nThe FBI report went to the United States Senate late last night every United States senator has looked at the port and the votes can proceed tomorrow and it looks like the Republican votes are there and come Saturday and it looks like Saturday come Saturday\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court and oh by the way again I Want to say that again\nThis is that it worked out this way he sees better that we went through the final final stop is better that we we we caved to the Democrats and gave them the last thing they want to because even though\nThe last and most Democrats were not going to be happy either way and we're not going to support Brett Kavanaugh either way the country okay a lot of the Republicans were a little squishy writes a lot of the Republicans who watched what happened last week\nThat Dr Ford she was credible compelling something happened to her a lot of Republicans a lot of independents I'm telling you what were conflicted last week for them\nFor this extra step out for them now they can say well the FBI looked into it they question ten witnesses and they found nothing\nWe told you last week that this would be better it would be better for everybody it would be better for the Senate it would be better for Brett Kavanaugh would be better for everybody all these Republicans and maybe some Democrats who will vote for Brett Kavanaugh it will be better for the country I'm not saying\nAnd the countries that can be divided you know how I feel the country's irrevocably divided right I don't believe we're ever going to be United again I'm not talking about that I'm Talking about Brecht Kevin I'm going on to the Supreme Court doing it this way\nWe set a time and now with hindsight we gave the Democrats there last bone was a good move\nTo the senator's looked at the report today the Republicans\nAre from it began with the White House and then it went to Grassley and every Republican that's looked through the FBI report has said are pretty much in unison okay we haven't learned anything there's no corroborating\nEvidence the FBI even the FBI did not find any corroborating evidence for either of these allegations not Dr Ford's and not miss Romero says nothing\nWhere we're where we were a week ago we know exactly today after the FBI investigation what we knew last week you've got a thirty five year old allegation\nWithout any without any corroborating evidence\nSand\nSo\nRepublican Susan Collins said hey ah\nIt it was a thorough investigation Republican Senator Jeff flake said I looked at it again there's no corroborating evidence neither Republican announcing they're going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but clearly signaling that they will\nI'm Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski a\n... in undecided undecided but will continue to look\nNo hint of misconduct Senator Chuck Grassley said\nIn his forty six page F. B. I. report no hint of misconduct\nNow the Democrats came out today and said what we would expect them to say after looking at the report well it's in complete\nThe story is what isn't in the report this is a sham investigation we need to interview another forty witnesses the Democrats all but acknowledging\nThat there's nothing in the FBI report not a thing\nSo feel good everybody and I know it's been an up and down a couple of weeks but feel good\nRemember how angry you were last friday when a oh here we go ... another obstacle oh an FBI investigation than I did my best to talk all of you also that ledge don't worry this is a good saying\nThis is a good thing this is the last card the dams have to play take it away take it off the table and then we'll get to vote the Dems have nothing left nothing else and Brett Kavanaugh will be all the better for it\nAnd that's where we are today\nAnd the first scheduled to vote to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh in the United States Senate is scheduled for tomorrow friday morning\nAnd then they'll vote [laughter]\nIt's it's so dang cool to be able to say finally\nVote to put\nBrett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court that is scheduled to take place on Saturday\nAnd then this long nightmare for him and don't ever forget about what he's been through these last two to three weeks his long nightmare his family's long nightmare\nWill be over I'm not taking anything away from what Dr Blasey Ford said no sir Reebok not at all [noise] but Brett Kavanaugh has been through hell these last couple of weeks\n[noise] and it's going to come to an end [noise] on Saturday\nI'm Joe Walsh to go anywhere [noise]\n\nHey Patrick you there [noise]\nOh yeah yeah I'm a joy to have two quick points um one I have to be honest I I don't uh I don't share

result of a boy being allowed and the girls rushed from due to the school districts transgender bathroom policy Pasha Thomas who's a little daughter was assaulted is understandably devastated\nMy daughter ... she was old fashioned ... ...\n... what happened to their infant devastated angry upset betrayed ... our our ... never thought you know who would think that when I was like my child is cold and there were ... in the bathroom Latin up a little\n... now this just open investigation is only the latest case\nOf alliance defending freedom standing up for the rights of men women and in this heartbreaking incident children all across America\nBut law suits and engaging over three thousand local attorneys all over America man that\nThat costs a lot of money you can help right now come on we'd been raising money all week\nMc Donald's um jury could come back anytime could come back tomorrow could come back over the weekend will probably come back early next week maybe not may not take that law may take a few days who knows but when the jury comes back\nI Hope everybody listening to me right now says a little prayer for the city of Chicago that the city of Chicago depending on what the verdict is\nA does not burn to the ground we'll get into that and the second or a attorneys today in the trial made there a final cases they're closing arguments in that twenty fourteenth shooting a\nPolice officer Jason Van Dyke and then the jury this afternoon began deliberating the prosecution or in their closing arguments man they pointed to the video the video live video of Van Dyke shooting Laquan McDonald sixteen times\nAs the teenagers stood there holding a knife in his right and the video a prosecutor noted that\nVan Dyke had told detectives that look climbing Donald raise the knife or that officer McDonald than backpedaled and that looked climbed McDonald tried to get up\nOff the ground after being shot the prosecutor today in her closing argument said none of that happened\nIt's not in the video you've seen the video officer Van Dyke is making that up now officer Van Dyke sitter nice in in their closing arguments\nTheir case was this was a police officer afraid for his life in the acted according to his training defense attorney Dan Herbert\nTold jury that that video that video of look climbed McDonnell being shot sixteen times it doesn't tell the whole story not even close um the defense went on to say that Ben dykes partner that night\nUh also said he saw the clown McDonald raised the knife even though the video doesn't show\nUp and then finally the defense noted\nThat I'm\nBeing dykes partner uh is one of three police officers charged with\nConspiring to try to cover up what happened on that night of October twenty twenty four team trying to protect officer Van Dyke both defense and prosecution\nWrapped up their closing arguments today the judge gave the jury their final instruction south Chicago police officer Van Dyke is has been charged with first degree murder aggravated battery and official misconduct\nOr the judge didn't tell the jurors this afternoon that they have the option\nOf convicting the officer for the lesser charge of second degree murder first degree murder carries a maximum sentence of life or\nThe maximum penalty for second degree murder is no more than Fifteen\nTo Twenty years the other point I Want to make is a Chicago police or\nBe done to prepare for any possible violence\nIn the aftermath of this verdict\nOr they've amped up patrols or many Chicago police officers have been assigned to twelve hour shifts and supervisors have canceled days off so they're gearing up\nFor potential violence\nI don't know how much you pay attention to the trial I tried to officer Van Dyke did take the stand during the trial he got quite emotional or and he said look it it's not the way it was on the video\nHe said look I I yelled drop the knife drop the knife ... McDonald kept advancing he wouldn't drop the knife\nOr officer Van Dyke testified that climbed McDonald's face had no expression his eyes were just bugging out of his head he had these huge white guys that were staring at me like he was on something or an autopsy by the way showed that look climbed macdonald did have PCP in his\nSystem his back never once turned towards me Van Dyke set\nBut again the difficulty of this case and the prosecutors quickly tried to pick his ... a part of a Van Dyke story pointing out that the video shows Van Dyke actually stepping toward McDonald shot him sixteen times he shot him after he was down\nTo pretty ugly case and I don't know what the jury's going to decide or the the defenses kinda got like an all or nothing case like if you can't convict this guy and first degree murder\nYou know forget about it but there's that video that is so troubling and you know that I uh I understand the numbers and I understand that in like Ninety eight percent of all

was on something and sure she didn't drop the knife he didn't follow instructions but when you look at the video he wasn't charging toward the police officer\nAnd he was even shot more after he went down\nProsecutors pounds by the way on uh the fact that Van Dyke officer Van Dyke told his partner or before they arrived at the scene that they were going to quote half to shoot the

prosecutors tried to make the case that band I can options\nThat he chose not to employ a before he opened fire the defense they had a really aggressive case they said look you know who's at fault fairly quiet McDonalds\nIt's his fault or he was holding the knife that night uh it was a tragedy that could've been prevented with one simple step if he had dropped the knife to the floor if he had

around watching it on to his thing\nAs this police officer just tribes ... gets out of his cart empties a pistol into this young man so if we're not going to watch for not going to factor in the Chicago\nThat we shouldn't factor at any race right at the age just guilty of of making a horrifying really bad decision at he willfully made me so that's\nThat's how I have a record which we you

with guns blazing like all of a sudden\nIt fits into he and his mind may or may up and that is the absolute definition of premeditated that's what they say that ...\nThat Rick thanks I appreciate it man thank you for your perspective think you're dead for his service or it is troubling let me go to a let me go to John John you're on with Joe Walsh\nYeah Hey Joe I saw it was my thing first degree murder is if he were to go out there and wake up in the morning and say I'm going to go kill somebody to its premeditated you know that he has three murder that's not second degree murder I think is more fit in here\nBut he was still an officer on the line of duty a man was we'll be in a nice not like he was you know just sitting in his car and the officer went up there and shot the guy\nYeah the little bit different than I think I don't think he should\nBe you know some of the rest of his life in jail for a split second decision\nYou know out there and that and making them you know\nJohn menu good call man you make the other compelling argument thinking man you're right I mean I Am so\nLow birth to question split second decisions that cops make because I don't walk in their shoes when they make these split second decisions you're right you're right and here's a guy on something with a weapon\nA judge in America won't even let the Trump Administration do that\nYou ... here you've got a program\nThat allows people to remain in the United states or and apply for work permits if their home country experiences a natural disaster armed conflict or some other extraordinary event\nBut they're only allowed to stay here temporarily but that's never how it works out and we have millions of these people who were brought over here temporarily\nWho've been here for a decade or two or three and now we have another judge blocking the Trump administration's effort to finally followed the law to follow the law this temporary protected status\n[noise] so this will be another issue now that we'll be kicked up\nKicked up the road and this will now become another issue\nThat the Supreme Court is going to eventually have to address a spokesperson from Trump's Justice Department said in a written statement and I agree that this judge's decision quote you ... the role of the executive branch\nJust and I'll just closed with this because everybody missed this last night 'cause all we're doing is talking about Kevin but just think about it right we we can even we can't even enforce this program\nThis temporary protected status program big earthquake in El Salvador okay twenty thirty thousand you can come over here you can come over here for a few months or a year or two\nAnd then they stay for a decade or two and we can't even move to return them to their home country they're not citizens of this country and here you have a judge who won't even allow us\nTo enforce that there's there's something so wrong about that or have Jim you're on with Joe\n[noise] gay man how are you good ...\nGood I'm Glad that you're correct these programs are it does however\nFor those that have been lawfully for Twenty years I have two friends of ours by from Honduras yeah\nDo they have homes

I'm a news drug nine nine died a rag Hey Greg thanks for hanging out\nHey Joe I'm listen my feeling on this whole trial with the the officer Van Dyke yeah is that the first of all the comments that he made when they were tried like car yeah about you know we might have to shoot the guy or something like that\nLook that he'd already heard stuff on the police radio I'm sure right\nRight that's sort of similar to like if you're driving in the car with somebody and you hear that there's an accident on the eyes and right and you're not to the accident yet and you turn to them and say something like we're probably going to have to get off the freeway\nRight or going to hit some traffic he's probably just tossing out loud tried to imagine what she's going to be like when they get there that have you heard there is somebody who was high on drugs throughout the night and who stabbed the cop car in the tire yeah probably thinking through these things and talking out loud to his\nPartner and secondly if one of my own blood relatives was high on PCP wandering around the street with a knife had approached the person who had to call nine one one and then when they encountered the police that the police car in the higher I wouldn't second guess the police for doing what officer Van Dyke did\nI got here but thanks guy got my music coming in my year but I appreciate your good call tough one it's a tough one [noise] brace yourself Chicago\n\n[noise]\nThis is the show was from a raft with us Joe Walsh former Congressman Joe Walsh infamous Joe on the same radio and if\nIf you're a small business owner then you need to know about you line you line is the leading distributor of shipping industrial and packaging materials to businesses threw out North America they serve hundreds of thousands of small business customers right here in the U.S\nIn July understands that small business owners are the engine of our economy\nIf any part of your business involves packing or shipping materials\nAnd here's the deal you need you line their capital luggage huge and it's full of high quality products they offer same day shipping the more than twenty seven thousand industrial products in July ... customer service is second to none for all of your shipping and industrial product needs\nContact you line called them today at one eight hundred to nine five five five one zero or\nOn line that you line dot com slash while sets U.

just tell you what I think I\nCan only tell you what I Believe\nI Can't sugar coated there's always pressure in this business talk radio conservative talk radio to feed the listeners what they want to hear you see that I'm conservative TV and conservative\nRadio there really isn't liberal radio show but but you look you see the same thing on the other side MSNB it is an and MSNBC and CNN [noise] both sides in the media and this is what they tend to do\nThey tend to give their listeners their viewers are what they think they want to hear say tend to feed them feed them the red meat\nOr I Can't do that I won't do that I never will do that I I don't understand how to do that I just I mean I just say what I Believe I'm ... you look at like for instance Fox News\nFox News knows that Ninety eight percent of the people watching Fox News are Trump supporters so Fox News is going to feed their viewers\nPro Trump pro Trump pro Trump no matter what\nPro Trump pro Trump pro Trump even if it's accurate pro Trump pro Trump pro Trump\nEven if the the talking head or the host doesn't believe it [noise] um I'll get to the other side and the second I just want make sure you understand this\nWhen you watch Fox News night after night after night your getting biased to news you understand that right\nNow I Hope you do it both sides guys [laughter] if you're watching MSNBC every single night you're getting biased news\nBoth sides are biased now I'm harping on Fox News and conservative TV because most people listening to me right now are\nLike me a conservative but don't for a moment I think that Fox News is not biased absolutely they are there's no such thing there is no animal there's no such animal is on biased\nMedia unbiased TV\nThat's crazy talk there's no such thing every newspaper every radio show every TV show every network has a bias\n\nWashington Post has a biased the New York times has a biased the wall Street Journal has a bias CNN has a biased ABC has a bias this radio show right here the Joe Walsh show has a bias\nAnd Jeff Fox News has a bias\nI just think it's so important for the viewer for the listener to understand that\nI I'm not saying don't watch Fox News just understand you're getting your getting eight side or they will slant their news they'll slant how they present it to you\nAre in in in a pro Trump fashion because they know that's what you want to hear\n\nThey'll decide what stories to play the failed decide what angles and issues to emphasize\nAnd their goal Fox News's goal is to feed you red meat red meat baby stuff he'll eat up both sides knew what CNN does it\nThey feed their viewers red meat they're red meat they know CNN knows that most of the people watching CNN don't like Trump\nSo you watch CNN all day all night you're going to get a steady diet of generally anti Trump\nFood the\nPoint that making to you my conservative fellow American is\nGoing for a moment get in front of me and tell me that the media is biased to me is all fake news\nExcept for Fox News Fox News is unbiased Fox News's and fake news [laughter] well I don't know what fake news is I'm telling you it's all biased\n\nThan to fire him why why my bringing this up well because if I I'm an American\nAnd I've got my conservative beliefs like me I'm pro life I'm pro gun I'm anti government you know what I Am I'm pro wall I'm pro border I'm I Want to be as informed\nUm and as educated as I can be\nI Want to be well informed\nAnd all I Do is watch Fox News and that's the only thing I watch\n\nI'm not getting the whole truth I'm getting a slanted truth I'm getting a biased truth\nAnd so then when the truth is because there is truth out there there is a truth CNN gives you their truth MSNBC gives you the truth for Joe Walsh radio show gives you his truth Fox News gives you their troop\nThere all giving you the truth is they see it the truth the truth that's something different\n\nLike like this notion of the blue wave\nAh\nThere there is a blue wave come and miss November thirty three days the only question is how big is it going to be\nBut for for for anybody on Fox News to tell you there's not going to be a blue wave 'em they're doing you were a disservice they're\nWrong um but\nThey're feeding you because you don't want to hear about the blue wave Everytime I blew a bring up the blue wave people get mad at me you don't want to hear about the blue wave Fox knows news knows that are conservatives don't want to hear about the blue wave\n[noise] so\nThey ignore the blue wave they tell you and that can be a big deal Republicans are going to do right there shouldn't be a red\nWave [noise] well that's a bunch of crap\n\nBut see my fear is and this is where I'm from Manhattan if you watch Fox News every night and they minimize or downplay or ignore the blue wave\nAnd then election night comes\nAnd the blue wave comes and the Democrats take back the house and maybe the Republicans barely hang on to the Senate\nOr they're going to be a lot of conservatives out there are a lot of Fox people out there who are going to say how how'd\nSean Hannity didn't tell me there was a blue wave coming lore Ingram didn't tell me there was a blue wave coming\nHow'd that happen [noise] again\nIf I Want to be informed and I want to be educated I'm not just watching Fox News\nI'm I'm I'm trying to get my news from as many different people as I can so that I Am [laughter] I'm not blown away by the truth [noise]\n\nTalk about a red wave oh boy [noise]\nDon't give at the time of day don't give that the time of day\nThat's just I I mean [laughter] I suppose there could\nBe a red wave a\nOn the monkeys uncle can I still say that I Believe there could be a runway but there is that going to be [noise] and I just believe that anybody telling you that\nIs doing you a real disservice because they're not giving you the truth [noise]\nAnd then you're going to be surprised and you're going to be disappointed come election day when there is a blue wave how big do no but there is a blue wave and you're going to wonder how that happened\n[noise] so what's the answer [noise]\nWhat the answer is if you wanna watch Fox News watch Fox News but balance your Fox News viewing by getting your news from other sources as well\nAnd then you figure out [noise]\nKind of what you think that the truth is I mean I'm In an unusual unique situation because I Do this for a living but I'm I'm Watch and\nSeven eight different TV shows every day and night MSNBC CNN Fox\nI'm going on to\nFifteen different websites everyday some conservative websites some websites in the middle\nAnd some Web sites on the left\nI'm trying to get a feel for how everybody's thinking I Want to know if MSNBC is telling me this and Fox is telling me that what does that me\nI I Know that MSNBC use given me the leftist to slant the anti Trump slant and Fox has given me the pro Trump slant\n\nTo them it's on me it's up to me so what's the answer

including in the case but they didn't need to go back over ground they'd already covered but in any background the youth of alcohol drugs other situations like that personal behavior is part of the routine background\nAll time so he would have been through those kinds of questions with classmates for professors\nNeighbors relatives and friends that would have already been covered what ... what was going to be covered in this case was\nWhat new based on what four but in her letter and in her sworn\nWhen you're given your experience do you think that the FBI had the ability to do as extensive a background check supplemental tack no federal ... days absolutely\nHe served as assistant director the FBI from from a system is director of the FBI from two thousand for two thousand eight altogether he was in the FBI for twenty nine years she asked him a very pointed question based on your experience do they have enough time to do a thorough background check he says yes absolutely\nBased on what for that in her letter and then her sworn\nGiven you're given your experience do you think that the FBI had the ability to do as extensive a background check supplemental tac yeah that was a day's absolutely okay\nBecause you've already heard in this case a week ago Saturday\nThey're not going to look at anything except poor or allegation and then the next day you hear they already interviewed Ramirez so and now you're hearing today that they've gone forward with some of the other interviews that were done and some of the other tips that they had gotten so\nThe White House just basically said we don't want you to do five years fifty thousand interviews in the case but narrow it down as much as possible to the most recent allegations that are credible and take a look at that and it sounds like they did or the senators who have already looked at the report wouldn't be saying that look thorough to them and [noise]\nThis is not Fox is on CNN I don't think that we are pleased\nSeveral of them are saying that mark judge in particular who is really a K A person for a lot of that they have it all\nSenator was tapped to for for three hours um\nSeparately though we do hear from the attorneys are both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez that they're not really that thrilled with with how it went down and let me just reveal a quote from Deborah Vermeer as an attorney she\nWas interviewed at part she at one of the night and fewer than four days later however the FBI apparently had concluded its investigation with out permitting agents to investigate we're deeply disappointed by the failure we can only conclude that the FBI or those controlling its investigation it not want to learn the truth behind\nRamirez actually the the argument there at that\nShe gave the FBI other people to talk to and that was followed\nBy for it I mean I think the problem is that if you let me control who you ask\nQuestions to I'm going to control what your answers are they going to get back to when he's in the second and that they're going on because as Don McGahn is White House was shepherding this whole thing\nTelling them and they are the clients 'cause I'm helping them who they should talk to and that's all they can talk to doesn't matter how good they are when they're talking to them they're only going to get the answers the White

point in their lives and given most women have many other important women in their lives a mom and a daughter\nSisters and a couple of close friends\nIt means that the overwhelming majority of American women\nBeen deeply affected deeply hurt by the tragedy of sexual violence\nI've had two very dear friends who've been raped and it is an act from the pit of hell\nThe me too movement of the

passed along a letter to the FBI from one of your constituents regarding the ... investigation for him to tell us more about\nThat I found the FBI and someone who wants to be interviewed who I'd sell everything from Asia and I had if after the part of the further background check\nOr what is that you know the FBI is agreed to interview this person\nI've been talking now now and that's why I caught

talk about the detail because this remains a confidential part of the background report I Hope that uh changes are made and we'll be able to talk more about what the FBI\nDid later but what I can say is it the most\nNotable part of this report\nIs what's not in it as we noted by the White House the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview doctors lazy for\nShockingly Dianne Feinstein feels that the FBI report is an adequate as does senator Coons\nI think it's going to be very close um I think um there's a number of senators both Republican and Democrat who haven't um\nYet the senator they did the deal with with like and I said at the time watch cartoons then say oh it wasn't it wasn't adequate enough wasn't thorough enough they should have taken more time\nAt made public what their final position will be a and I hope they're going to look at this report and I hope they are going to reflect on a number of other things are ways in which a judge Kavanaugh showed um I think a part isn't inclination or a lack of judicial temperament and how he conducted himself in front of the committee and a number of other issues\nYou see when you were accused of sexual assault just supposed to be calm cool and collected about that and if you don't mean to you last traditional temperament issues\nThat have been brought forward or both through this process in\nPublic school I've been accused of sexual assault is not right before I'm an old hand it there's a big you senator I really\nQuickly and I hope that we're flex a hard on how this balances out

against a fitness and character\nIn other words you have no intention of voting for him ... senator Blumenthal\nMSNBC it's reported that they still have failed to interview not\nThis is the one who misrepresented his Vietnam record said that he was in country when in fact he was never in country probably as a result of and if you\nLie about one thing what did he say to Kevin all when you lie
