{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "A Aaron shares you know not only from her heart but from her experience and from the love of her little children and ah you know some\nSome great council in there so a Arun welcome to bill emerging as like good to have you with us\nOh thank you so much for having me I'm delighted to be here\nWell a entering a we know 'em I say we know and I'm saying this from a father's side because uh you know fathers learn real quick ... into a degree uh and it's quite shocking\nUh when we learn really what moms do for the family and for kids\nAll it takes his mom kind of you know maybe taking a couple of extra hours that could be shopping in God Forbid that it's a weekend because then if you're going for the entire weekend ... you know dads are in therapy for at least three months you know trying trying to realize going oh my\nGod what am I doing years or so moms have their hands full and are we on her mom's more than just one day you're here on Bill Maher Tina's everyday that we're on her mom's 'cause we love them and we're so grateful for um you know what they do for our families\nAh well thank you so much and I I yeah I agree wholeheartedly with that and and lots of grateful every time my husband uh is they will pay for health and give me those hours or sanity\nAnd but I Do I Do agree um I think that a variety of jobs and that definitely being a mom and he's been challenging I thought that the most rewarding but it's also the most challenging for me at least that really caught me\nOff to a place where I Am just not enough like I think that they can go to voice my husband and I have to raise\nTo train up then hopefully had bring up you know the lord and I was just an awesome responsibility and it's something that you get hired in white out my patience gets fan and and it's something whether I Want her on the fission whether at that they can do and it's\nActually been so wonderful and reassuring because it's in this moment with the lord has really reassuring to me that it's not really up to me that I can depend on him that he is always the ...\nOr ... even through this moment thing my children he invited me to become a child again to to the child and and just see my kids like the eyes of the states and Wilder and she'll lay in the comfort of comfort with it and they like\nKids have now I just ask for help and has been encouraged at that and that sort of relationship with God through them\nYou know it really is when you stop and think about it um a friend of mine has written in one of her books are about um you know about the spirit of a child I mean Jesus said the unless you come as a child\nA yeah you know I mean when you think about the the ... of that perspective a did God wants you to come to him as as a child you know very ... you know it's\nI'm very honest very direct a unassuming and um you know all the bravado was set aside 'cause and especially with two boys I mean you know [laughter] I I had three boys so was my three sons for many years\nUntil I had another son and daughter as soon as I had a daughter I was done I mean I got reduced to my lowest common denominator [laughter] so uh but yes with a with boys especially but they're they're just so honest and uh and and can be so much fun but also in the process as you mentioned\nUm because it's so much about doing that you forget about being and in the process\nYou forget who you are even as a mom or as a child of gun\nAbsolutely I Love that it I Love\nWhat you said about coming to God with\nSort of child like that and I think yes ISIS today that and it's like it's so wrapped up in what am I doing checking out my to do list out like I Do all the time\nLike hit where am I may just how much they want to be with me I can take them out for the Sunday school and I enjoy just light up their face or and then a babysitter and and there's a mom you're home and\nI I just love that honesty about wanting to be with me and I think that's what God cause I too as well and one thing we can last for like ... it's just that a deep desire to want to be\nAh with the this and we don't have to have it all together and don't worry whatever you know they look perfect or they say things perfectly they just want to be with their parents exactly their mom and dad and I I think I got it is just as we are and he wants us to come to handling and offer all of our honest emotions even on\nA ... so well as you stated um you know after the boys were born you realize that your identity I mean because we don't we don't travel or do you mean in in many cases it's identified with what we do you do your work you were an attorney or professor\nUm I mean you had a you know you have an educational pedigree\nAnd ah so ah I also admire women who were able to transition and uh and and sometimes it's the first season and uh and understood and sometimes I'm\n... you know 'cause uh I I don't know him and may maybe because young girls were diluted by uh\nYou know who who who was the one of the super heroines I'm a super woman and they think that they can convince me that way so they they try to do both said which is amazing to me a bit you know so you go from your identity being with what you do and now you're a mom\nAnd you know when you talk about in your book about you know losing a sense of identity as God it identifies you not as the world identifies you\nAbsolutely and and I'll just tell you're looking at that that kind of this you know it's not pretty [laughter] it was it was um it was difficult time and still sometimes and then I I Do a little bit of everything and all of our work from home sound that\nBut I realize that at least for me it's really easy to cut my identity and whatever and get a handle on whether it's my job as a lawyer or whether it's my job at home with the kids\nOn and have all of this things are I think not what God wants us to I was and and the gospel where Jesus Says that ties than the God is still please introduce them to the world and\nWhat he found is not you know this is the same here that's not the regime or they feel or all of these things that are true about Jesus\nOr rather he introduces them really simply and he says this is like a lot of fun and Manuel please\nAnd I just I Love that because I think that our identity to speak and to what we need to hear that word but a lot of daughters and apart from our job to roll even as long as we are seeing a lot of daughter first and it's out of that knowledge to an identity that we can't truly love our own children\nMhm and when you talk about your background I mean it it is impressive I mean what you were doing is as an attorney or a professor of law or a ... especially ... when I when we when I hear an attorney who loves the constitution as much as I Do\nUm [noise] you you can have you can have whatever you want air and I'm I'm On your side whenever I can do to help you out um I\nI mean you have a ... in your career I mean I'm you worked as a department of justice has counseled attorney general Michael ...\nUh so you have you've paid your dues you also reformer clerk to chief justice John Roberts and I got to imagine in light of ah you know the recent to a hearings for justice Kevin all that that had to be quite painful for you\nIt was it was difficult to the end of the I I Know just have not well I'm a work in the same building and he and we actually\nI played basketball together [laughter] it is is this great tradition that the Supreme Court clerks play the DC circuit a clerk I thought of a tournament um participate in that and\nI have a number of friends who work in court for him and or I'm very pleased and on our two days ago and I think it just shows the real divide fitness in our country and also in the center standing of the role of a judge on\nThe role of the judges issue on now is to interpret the law that Congress has written a natural by the constitution and it's not to make a new thing and it and if we lean guy just kind of strange at those roles and they don't have a lot more comfort and end up wanting someone because we know they're not going to impose their on policy preferences are\nEither own way of how they think things should have added by the Democratic process for the people that we'll get a ... ... ...\nYeah exactly which like an empire I mean you sound like I go to say well are you a Republican or Democrat no we don't even think about that we just know they're there to call balls and strikes right and that\nThat that kind of social but unfortunately um it it has been an average of this you know with activist judges and also a a the political forces that to want to circumvent the process of a legislation\nAnd going through the process there's a reason are fought founding fathers are said hey slow down take your time let's listen to bake this let's talk about it\nAnd uh and when it's appropriate if we need to amend something will amend as we need to create alone will create a law but there is a way in which to do it but don't go to the bench and are expected judges singlehandedly unilaterally to create law and this is what's happened and this is why it's been a disturbance\nAnd so I thought oh good\nOh just yeah I agree with that completely and I was just you can't change it or at least not very easily competition you can't change it at all run out of there weren't as the final word in it if it's a statute that it takes a lot of effort to absolutely\nYeah if you think not I'm a I'm sure Erin ... rent out her voice for you for a weekend and then they find the rule of law real quick right [laughter]\nYeah yeah absolutely\nPlease and ran for two years Nineteen forty seven through Nineteen forty
