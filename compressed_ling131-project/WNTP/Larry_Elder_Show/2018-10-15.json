semester oh we don't get to see him again\nAnd we've gone today to celebrate pad and as I look around this room and I just want to say to you guys who are here today as friends\nAnd thank you all of us have memories of Mr Earl all of us could stand up here and tell stories for the rest of the day and and maybe for the rest of the week and I remember his servant spirit cutting grass the church or fixing my lower one time\nAnd and I tell people often that you know are you preach your funeral service while you're living\nAnd I remember this preacher funeral why you're living sometimes people come up me and they say man that was a good funeral essays 'cause their personal life is easy some people come on demand that was that was a rough funeral 'cause I didn't give us much to work with Russia [noise]\nMr all gave us plenty to work with and so we call them today was that hard but we come today we're glad heart knowing he lived well and so we we miss him but we honor him\nYou breach your funeral all your living well said now here's Dr Jeff how new followed pastor chip in this service\nIf you're like me you might have thought that this day would never come borough pitcher\nEarl cheated death so many times\nThat we thought he was going to outlive us all and I literally thought he'd cheated death one more time this past Monday morning a week ago today I got a text message from Pam and she said hey dad is declining rapidly we would love for\nYou to come over and and pray mom would love for you to come over and pray over him and so I went over there and we got together and sure enough he was unresponsive\nAnd I literally saw that at any minute they were going to tell me he's gone till the next morning\nAnd so then I I get right outside their house and I finally get attacks from Pam and she said daddy sitting up in the bad eating breakfast [noise]\nAnd so I said what would it be okay for me to come in and visit with him and she said absolutely please come and so I went in the house and they took me back to the bedroom and there he was sitting up in the bed finished at a McDonald's biscuit that somebody brought to it [noise]\nAfter he finished those ... said where's my tone\nAnd he shared a donor and a cup of coffee with me one of the first things he said to me was Jeff I Need you to do me a favor I Need you to tell Larry's stay gay that I'm probably not going to be at my post Sunday Morning [noise]\nAnd I said Mr Earl I'm not going to tell area thing [noise]\nBecause what I saw yesterday at what I see the day you're liable to be there on Sunday Morning\nWell he had the last word on that and he was right let me ask you how many people do you know are getting approved for serving with children when they are eighty three years old\nOr all did\nTwo thousand fourteen just three years ago at eighty three he signed up to serve in our children's ministry sports camp and then in April of a bitch gear at eighty six years of age Earl venture responded to the color of our church to make room in his heart\nFor more people\nAnd he did so by signing up eighty six years old by signing on to serve on our greeter\nTeam and less than two weeks before he died he was at his post scooter\nAt the equipping hall entrance making people feel welcome does a cane for warship\nPearls hardest service well marked his entire life\nThe whole system not just something that Earl had learned to do in his old age as a younger\nMan when ... was located old spillway road is pastor said many times the will take his lawn more up to the church and for years he mowed the grass at the church\nHe was known by the children there is the candy man as they knew that he had some sweet treats in his pocket and whenever they came to church he would always bless them with some can\nBe and I thought a lot about the way that oral venture sir\nAnd it occurred to me that there were two qualities of his life and they're gonna have to be two qualities of any person's life is going to be devoted to serving others\nQuality number one is he a surrendered to surrender\nI remember the story of when king David was about to die and he was about the hand the kingdom over to his son Solomon the last word some of the last instructions that David gave the Solomon and first chronicles chapter twenty eight or nine words is asked\nFor you my son's Solomon no the God of your father\nAnd served him with a whole heart and the ... mind\nTo serve God with the whole heart into willing mind implies that you've already surrendered\nTo God to lead him lead your life and so I asked are all on Tuesday Morning\nOr when did you open your heart DeJesus when did you surrender your life to Jesus Christ and Earl shared with me it happened when he was about junior high school age\nAnd he told me that he a turn for missing than any a trusted crisis it's safer needed surrender viewers is light to him folks that was about Seventy three years ago\nWhen all committed his life to Jesus Christ and so if you do anything for Seventy three years chances are you're going to get pretty good at it\nJeff shares the second quality Earl head that helped him serve others\nBut there was a second quality needed if you're going to serve others and that is\nSelflessness of selflessness about you serving others doesn't always happen when it's convenient for you know serving\nOthers doesn't always fit in with your time schedule or when you think it ought to take place\nFirst Peter for ten reminds us to use whatever get we have received to serve others\nWhatever give the Holy Spirit has given us where do you use that give to employ it in service to other people and to do this requires an attitude that says put others first\nKaren shared with may just the other day that she could never remember a single time\nIn her life when she needed her daddy [noise] she let him know and he was an on his way to help her\nHe was always making sure that he did everything he could\nTo serve and to bless his family he was a hard worker Jordan his oldest granddaughter shared ... she said and her twenty nine years her granddaddy showed up at every recital every ball game or anything his grandkids were involved in\nAnd then it didn't start with that generation his great grandkids can say the same thing of him just about a week\nBefore he died when he was so sick or I was sitting at the ballpark cheering his Joshua on in his baseball game selflessness\n\nThey just couldn't figure it out there like where\nAre these phone calls from coming from it's like a ... billion calls well the all the calls are originating\nAd Hawaiian animal hospital in it turns out it wasn't exactly a person making all these phone calls one right after another it was a gecko and tried to get go on and I found that was making all these phone calls you\nKnow we started thinking about it here at the ... commander show I said\nI just spent the gecko is calling progressive for quote that's right and you say ladies and gentlemen just an example of all the fun that we have here week after week as we talk about living the\nBass digital lifestyle ever it's called the game commando show you can find out that over four hundred top stations from coast to coast and around the globe on armed forces radio because after all\nI Am American ... digital got at\nLives in a phone lines are open love to hear from you I'm sure you have at least a few questions about something digital I can lend a hand to and from trusted advice\nAnd that number simple one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us\nOnce in a toll free number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four and as you're going in and let's get this party started already was our global tech news of the week up day as well you know exactly what's going on in the tech world and we're going to start the news with the little item\nThat oh gosh [noise] and then it cause you some anguish some anxiety some uneasiness\nBecause imagine that there's some far off country who they don't really like us here in the United states and they wake up one day and they decided to take action against us\nWell you'd think that our very own department of defense that they have their act together right\nWell after all they're protecting us think again news out this past week the downright frightening our weapons systems can easily be hacked by adversaries many systems are still using default passwords\nAnd one test the team was able to gas and admin password and I remember an administrative password is like the keys to the kingdom\nAnd nine seconds and another case it took a two person team just one hour to gate initial access to a weapon system and then they gain full control the entire system in a single day\nAll right so what kind of the ... let me tell you it wasn't the drink machine and the break room after guessing the password in a few minutes and they can take total control of the systems they could crash planes they could launch weapons and they downloaded about a hundred and fifty gigs of confidential data to\nEarn so why has this report coming out right now yeah sugar thinking cap on because Congress ordered the report\nBefore they were ready to approve the DOD funding of one point six trillion dollars so that the Pentagon could expand its weapons portfolio is a whole bunch of new toys might I suggest we spent in just a little bit of that money on a good password manager that tribe\nAnd another frightening news if your freaked out that you think that the robots are just taking over the entire world and they're going to do your job and everybody in your family okay have you seen the latest Boston Dynamics robot this things by the name of atlas\nWell it's running it's jumping and taking off over obstacles is doing like basic park core and then the videos you the mighty atlas jogging around a grassy field he leaves over a log within his path\nAnd he uses his whole body legs arms torso\nSteps are about one put four inches as computer vision on the approach they say to hit terrain accurately\nThey call this robot the world's most dynamic humanoid weighs about Seventy five kilos which is about a hundred and sixty five pounds basically what this means that you're seeing the video if your kids club member you're actually seeing this video\nIs that outlets can shifted to wait and it's got eight twenty eight joints that has hydraulics built and now the D O D said they're not really sure like one of these robots and I'm sure they would ever use them in combat but here are some things that I can do right now stand up after falling over\nRun balance on a narrow beam and get this atlas is a really good at cleaning vacuuming and sweeping All right I Know what you're thinking\nThat robot has to be cheaper than keeping my wife and in other robot taking over the world news here's something that you may be never thought of\nWhat would it be possible for a self driving car\nIt not just being a self driving car but to use all of this technology be so bad that it can be a WMD a weapon of mass destruction [noise]\nWell research out this past week that autonomous vehicles are a giant security Redskin white had to get there before the black cats and do\nIn a closed door a Q A session Ilan most of that but a fleet wide attack was Tesla's nightmare scenario and announce that they were going to open source their security modules so that all the auto makers could work together for\nA safer self driving future\nAll right I just hope it when they open source of all they do a better job of bad than actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can't even changes in the fall password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now\n[noise] boy I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of wave that is Google's self driving taxis right\nAnd it's rolling out across the United states but how they plan to use it is very interesting and I bet nobody has told you this yet about way mo because\nLet's do the math together how does Google make its money anybody yes you in the foreign truck they make a huge chunk of change off of advertising right or companies buying advertising people seeing advertising so put us all together with a self driving taxi\nThe see the future yet do you envision how it's gonna we're All right let's say you go to Google and you search for I don't know fresh Christmas tree up pops in ad for a place five miles away too far to walk too far to

so back to the labs they when they came up with a brand new sound\nAnd the minute from a speaker located behind the front and grilled since we heard in every direction so let's take a listen to the sound that the brand new electric jaguars going to make in your neighborhood oh\nThat ought\nTo add the electric cars going by that's the sound that that the that the researchers say that doesn't sound like a size five space craft or what do you think Andrea I'm ready for that\nWhy don't they just make it sound like a car like a V. eight [laughter] [laughter] so you can use that one yeah yeah you know what you just can't beat the sound of a V. eight or bigger right good I mean here we are we still sounds like a space craft to make it look enough where's that where's ... sounds like a
