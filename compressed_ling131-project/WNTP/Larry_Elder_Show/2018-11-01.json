say we are noble we're out of a dairy store and they take it personally and\nShe's changed the conversation to [noise]\nNot that his policies are silly or not working or any of those other things it's all about the fight jeeze he's able to to know everything else and get people just focused on the flights\nAnd by the way John Stewart is a man of the left he's a lefty he's the lip he hates Trump but listen to what he said right there Trump's able to bathe him Trump's able to get inside their heads because they've got such she goes right\nThese people who work in the media they've got they've got such narcissism\nLook at me I'm show noble how dare you Donald Trump talk to me like that I'm the White House reporter for CNBC how dare you talk to me like that\nTrump hits them over their head and knocks them down because they're so narcissistic and I'll be the first one to admit Donald Trump is a nurse assist like nobody else you and I know that\nBut these people in the media tried to hide the fact that that's what they are as well\nThey've always been conditioned to believe these people in the media that they can say things and never be questioned\nEspecially by politicians elected officials no no I work in the media it's my job to question you man you can't ask me questions and then they get to a pie and just say what they want always on checked\nWhat is Trump done Trump's brought them down to his level by fighting them and you know most people\nIn the media don't like to get their hands dirty they don't like to get down and dirty that's not who they are right they live in their high rise apartments and ... they're whining endure above it all remember 'cause they're smarter than you are there more enlightened venue they're different they're better than you\nAgain no reflection on who Trump is Trump has decided I'm just kind of punch him I'm going to fight them\nAnd that's what he's forced them to do their ... we used to getting away with whatever they said Don Lemon last night did it again said something that went on question or or on an unquestioned in an examined last night he has since been\nPounded upside the head by all of us out here for what Don Lemon said because he said a pretty racist thing but again\nYou can get away with it ordinarily you can get away with it people in the media have always gotten away with what they said\nThat limited down with Chris calm on CNN they're talking about uh the caravan\nOr the brown folk and the black folk part of the caravan coming up\nAnd Don Lemon doesn't like the fact that we're demonizing the people in this caravan they're not the problem we shouldn't demonize people desperate down lemon says he says we shouldn't demonize people and then Don Lemon last night said this gimme lemon number one\nI have to stop the demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in the\nCountry is white\nMost of them are radicalized for up to the right\nWe can't demonize people and then he proceeds to demonize white men Devon play that again\nAfter stop demonizing people and realized her biggest pair of ... in this country is white man mostly I'm radicalized for up to the right\nYou imagine tried to ah if somebody on Fox News said the biggest problem in America's black man black men are the problem in America\nI can tell you that if somebody on Fox News or any other network said that black men are the biggest problem in America I can tell you that that that\nThat talking head would be out of a job you understand that right black men are the problem we got to be afraid of black men\nBut they're down lemon can say that white men are the problem in America white men not these people in the care of and you got nothing to worry about\nJose in any other uh felons in that caravan they're not the problem the problem is white men\nAnd see here's the media point nobody none of his peers has called him up or questioned him I Know if I sat on the radio right now black men the biggest problem we gotten America right now is black men or I Would be called a racist in every name you can imagine\nBut you can say that about white men and you're just find a a time you're on mature Walsh\nYeah Jo she said on CNN that we can't demonize people then he turns around and he demonized\n[laughter] and and you know what's funny Tom when you watch it he didn't even realize what he did\nWrite it was it was totally a ignorant yeah and especially okay we can't demonize people so I'm going to make a statement and demonize people\nI'm going to demonize people without lynching without even up pause I'm going to demonize people but I'm going to demonize white men 'cause you can get away with that in America that's no big deal\nYou can demonize white men you can demonize Christians you can\nGenerally demonize a white Christian men really easily but there are certain people certain groups you can't demonize kitten immunized black man you can't demonize Muslims you get demonize gauge you can't demonize transgender\nBut every day every\nDay it's open season on white men that's easy\nAs you can say whatever you want about whites and download images from Joel\nFalls\nHaven't seen evidence of that that people are literally dying all over America\n\nYou know the best ... maybe the best to things Trump has going for him and Hillary Clinton Everytime Hillary speaks right every time Hillary speaks\nA two three four thousand Americans decide I'm going to vote Republican on November six the other great thing that Donald Trump as going for him is lunacy I mean the author\nLunacy\nOf his\nThe opposition\nOther countries should issue travel warnings because of our mid term elections that's what you said other countries should should travel

that I Believe we're going to be polarized for some time it's just the way it is\nI tweeted this this afternoon think about this if if you were ... and miss the if you're listening I Wanna I Wanna long discussion of this sometime maybe after the midterms but if you took the United states as it is today\nAnd you were going to start over\nAnd you were going to start a country from scratch you with me you take the United states as it is today and you want to start over and you want to set out to form a country from scratch\nNo way on God's green earth would you make us all one country there's no freaking way\nWe'd be like three to four separate countries do you follow me like if she took us right now if you took the United states as it is right now and you said okay let's start over right now let's start over a ... for my country there's no way\nYou put us all in one country we'd be two three four or five different countries\nAmerica's gotten too big and too diverse and we're just two different we no longer share a common founding principal so we're\nGoing to be polarized for a long time\n... it's not like the midterms are going to come and then all of a sudden we're going to be United again and it's not like all of a sudden the twenty twenty election is going to come and we're going to be United again we're polarized and it's only going to get worse\nI'm Sorry moms and dads this Halloween Night if you don't like the way things are politically in America right now I'm Sorry to tell you it's only going to get worse\nI Believe that but when you look at how

Jews are rich they're evil when would you support they're evil\nLemon juice or uncontrolled or take over the world when the Jews are being exterminated to try to take over the world it's a rational it's ultimately demonic it comes through people but it would it defies description and like I said like you repeating it's never far Kurdish her\n... and Dr Brawley why is that I'm a Catholic kid I'm married to a lovely Jewish woman why is that hatred for Jews why is it been there for so long why why is it so I'm the president\n[noise] yeah I I've been through the various explanations why geezer scapegoat at the economic explanation political explanation to me it alternately has a spiritual explanation\nThat God shows the Jewish people and through the Jewish people triggering redemption through the world through Laos is through the profits ultimately treat Jesus to the message spreads either Jewish or partial\nThere is a little league evil force called say Jim Justice there she meant evil their spiritual evil\nAnd she hates the Jewish people\nJesus himself was Jewish the apostle from profit church Jewish\n... is the Jewish people that brought the message of the one true God to the world the Jewish people that brought the lessons at the ten commandments should ultimate authority ... and ultimately the message of salvation and that is hated by the devil and those are the lectures I gave it places like yell and Colombia and no one had a better explanation\nDr Michael Brown he is widely considered to be the world's most for most messianic Jewish apologist you said something a few minutes ago Dr brown that that jumps out at me and you write a black supremacist in white supremacist oddly\nUnite on this hatred of juice that's incredible\nYeah and in my book our hands are staying with blood with which came out like the Ninety two and it's been continuously imprint ever since and translated into more languages than in any book that I wrote I give quotes from every different side I I mean if you could you could change the hot\nLanes say go to the middle east now it'll change from the PLO to the Palestinian authority\nOut you know from this group that loss or whatever it change the players you change the black ... white supremacist that generation it's the same rhetoric their show on I just got an email today for the Christian political leader of North Carolina\nAnd she said how do I respond to this I was just as it is and it's about all the ... ... and how to choose one to kill all gentile I should just explore ignore the person or the ... the website\nBut it's the same stuff being on we cycled and all you need is a little fuel for the fire\nAll you need a say a major Jewish leader over banks and that's the truth that Jews control all the money in the world you have a little scandal and the Vatican their shows are as rational as it is so it's a stabilized games recycled generation after generation\nAnd yet you said and I agree historically the United states of America has been somewhat of a safe haven for Jews hasn't it\nYes in fact there's this famous letter from a from a synagogue in Connecticut\nCharles synagogue the leaders wrote to George, Washington at Seventeen Ninety it's after the revolution are now a nation and they just wanted to do I mean what's gonna happen to the news\nAnd he said our country is not tolerate bigotry and it's not going to tolerate persecution or or richer and he said made the stock of Abraham made the children of Abraham live long and prosper here\nThat's been a tone that's been sad so I Believe it's because America has had some strong Christian traditions\nOf the founders even look to America to be kind of a new Israel yeah there was a steam for that a president John Adams had great admiration of respect for the Jewish people into the influence they've had for good worldwide is totally disproportionate\nJust somehow there's been a ... and\n... and I believe it's one reason ... with all of our failings just that we have been\nA friend of Israel Harry Truman show up for Israel recognized it was the right thing to do even though it went against the grain of many of his his colleagues and advisors she'll we've had a good history there and yeah there has been bloodshed there is anti Semitism\nBut many leaders like Dennis ...
