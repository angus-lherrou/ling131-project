politically we're both crazy Tea Party conservatives\nAnd he's been worried about me lately he has a sense that I'm not as fired up as I once was\nWe got to talking about politics we got to talking about what's going on in America right now we got to talking about the radio show this show and we got to everybody everything eventually gets to Trump right\nI mean you're talking about the weather you get to Trump you talk about uh the uh the the ... or the or the major league playoffs right now it gets to Trump\nEverything eventually gets to Trump how's your uncle do and you'll end up talking about Trump so we eventually got to Trump [noise]\nAnd he said Joe I got to be straight with you I look I don't doubt who you are politically you've always\nDone what you said you were going to do you always say what you believe I've never doubted that you're a conservative when you were in Congress she had the most conservative voting record of anybody in Congress I don't doubt who you are politically Joe Biden\nBut man\nI've noticed that you Ben these last four to six to seven months you've been especially rough on the president\nThen we went back and forth for about twenty twenty five minutes\nAnd he was the one then that eventually said look Joe [noise] I don't I don't like Trump and the man\nHe said this to me I don't like him I think he's kind of a son of a gun I think he's kind of a jerk\nBut you know what I Love what he's doing and I believe God picked him to run this country now\n[noise]\nGod's picked flawed people before God has picked people of questionable behavior before\n\nThe end of the conversation with that\nYeah whatever you think Trump Joe I just I think look I I think he's he's been chosen to leave this could lead lead this country right now I think got picked him I think God brought him to us\n\nAnd I have spent most of today\nPoring over that\nThey didn't many regards it makes sense to me\n\nYeah got got picks all kinds of interesting people to do interesting things God picks all kind of all kinds of people with problems in his shoes\nTo lead at various times in the history of this world but it's got picked Trump almost two years ago\nTo become president of the United states then I'm assuming got picked Obama as well\nRight\nI mean you you can't get away from that and I know I've got everybody listening to me right now people from across the political spectrum listening to me right now people of all political beliefs people of all religious faiths\nThen I'd generally hear from conservatives\nThat notion that wine that belief that\nYeah Joe you know Trump's yeah yeah Trump Trump's out my favorite human being but got picked them but got picked him at this moment in time to lead this country at this moment in time\n\nThen when I think about that I always try to immediately throw it right back at them okay I Believe that but thank God did pick Obama too right God pick for Rocco bomb it to be president United States eight years ago ten years ago now did me\n\n\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred didn't he\n\nI mean you can't you can't pick and choose right\nI'd like you to answer that question I'd like to kind of launch on this no chill friday that discussion do you believe God picked Trump\nOr as flawed as he is God picked him to leave this country at this moment in time and if you believe that then God\nPicked Iraq Obama in two thousand and eight and son of a gun by a guy decided to have Brock Obama re elected in two thousand and twelve I don't think\nYou can tell me that got picked Trump but he had nothing to do with Obama that was like one that snuck through God didn't see that one comment [noise]\nI I I I I Want you to answer that I Want to drill down on this\nAnd maybe you don't believe even if you're a God fearing man or a God fearing woman maybe you don't believe\nThat God did pick Trump and oral by the American people did\n\nBut I don't think I I don't think you can separate it and this is what I've been wrestling with all day\nI'm not look you you know me I I I Am still where I was I I'm Still today where I was\nA two years ago almost two years ago when I voted for Trump\nWhen I voted for Trump two years ago I said I don't like the kind of person he is but I'm voting for him because I hate Hillary\nAnd I want a Supreme Court justice or two and I want a wall on my border and I want us to get tough with Muslims who are trying to enter this country\nI voted for Trump because of the Supreme Court he wouldn't Hillary and maybe one or two other issues I voted for Trump not really like and who he was and I still don't like two years\nI haven't changed at all\nBut it's an interesting notion that even if you believe Trump's not really a good guy\n\nWill God has picked men and women throughout history\nWho've been great sinners so it's not a stretch is it and it's not a reach is it that God picked this guy was that hair\nAnd he said I Know you've got issues Donald Trump\nBut you are gonna kick this country I Want you to kick this country's political system and the buy in right now you're going to be president but see my issue is my problem is I I've heard from\nMany of my my my fellow Christian conservatives who love to get on that soap box right you love you love to get in that alter and you love to say God picked Trump Trump is chosen by God but then what about Obama right and and you have a hard time with that\nWell you don't want to go there\nGot one in ... Obama to be president his country to in fact you want to block Obama so much he won in ... Obama reelected in twenty twelve\n\nI I think it's either both or or God had nothing to do with either one but you can't cut that cake\nYou can't tell me maybe you can and if you want to try please do that and God picked Trump but he had nothing to do with Obama because he never pick somebody like Obama\nI I don't know how you wrestle there with that one\n\nBut I Apologize I been pondering on this all day and so this note chill friday I wanted to start here give me a call\nDid God pick Trump warts and all to run this country right now\n\nAnd if he did [noise]\nHe also picked Obama beneath [noise]\nFree\nOne to six for two fifty six hundred [noise] call me Joe Walsh of going\nWell it also deception is in there you know people are just see than a trick\nYeah I Believe that Obama was elected so that it would push people all the way to the other side to get a Trump election in ... in your eyes on back you know get people back in line to get the country back in line\nAnd in your eyes Mitch God had a hand in both Obama and Trump\nOh yes definitely\nThank you for calling I I I I Apologize if this is\nA too heavy of a question for no chill friday I just have not been able to sort through it all day and I'd love to get your take on this\nUm\nI don't believe Trump is ... ... you know you know how I feel I I I really don't believe these American guy I support a lot of the policies I really don't believe he's very good guy and I know there I I Know there are plenty of Trump supporters who wrestle with that he's not a very good guy but some good things are happening did God pick him\nAnswer answer me that did God picked Trump and\nHow can you say God pick Trump but he didn't pick Obama did he pick both [noise]\nThree one two six for two fifty six Andrea\nI'm Joe Walsh I'm from [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nTime to check more freedom voicemail and see what you're saying about you oh my God I Know\nSome people call it a lot for the\nShooting and all all of them the same thing I mean the GOP probably ... probably ... probably felt like there that make you do for the whole week but I mean why why why not try to do that same amount of oh it's a\n... sort of course and why would they be act the way that the actor you know are they trying to figure out a way of the cockroach ... a man in his apartment in and bought it\nAt ... ... talk about that over the radio was trying to figure out a way to to get\nWell she could've been to deal with that caught me at work and why would they put a wall of what I mean this was about ... to ... when it comes to the second in may that a lot more about\nThat is why ... getting shot up like they get in Charlotte N.C and William nowhere near the number for some people they still way ahead of the gate with their\n...

you're on\nI have now been saying this for seven or eight years I was saying this when I was in the United States Congress or eight years ago uh we are about I think about eleven twelve years into the third American Revolution\nYeah I think that I I think it's that big of a deal\nI think America is breaking up I think America is divided I don't think America is ever going to be United again that's just me what I Know right now though is this country is going through a revolution we are living in revolutionary times I Know that\nThis country is engaged in a political war I Know that\nIt started before Trump Trump's election twenty sixteen was just one of the latest battles\nThe fight over Brett Kavanaugh was the most recent battle these midterms coming up this November and then this will be the next battle in this war and when people ask me\nWhat ... what do you mean Joe what do you mean we're at war in this country what do you mean that we're going through a revolution what do you mean that we're divided\nThis is what I mean are about half of this country who wants to go back to a country\nThat it hears to the principal's this country was founded by\nFreedom a very limited government and individual self reliance and that's it a country with the government that generally stays the hell out of our lives right you've got about half of America that still sort of wants that\nAnd then you've got another half of America that doesn't want that you've got half of this country half of the people in this country and I would argue more than half the people in this country no longer want what I just said\nYou know every time I give a speech and every time I talk about what America was founded upon\nI I I give America's founding principal in about Thirteen seconds\nIt's

that\nThat that's the founding principal of America freedom plain and simple but now fast forward two hundred and forty some years in the year twenty Eighteen or I Would argue most Americans no longer what that\nMost Americans today\nThey want in America with a government that does everything for us they want they want the free college they want the free health care they want the free welfare\nThey want the delivery livable wage they what they want the corporate welfare they want all of these government bureaucracies they want and government run in and control in our lives they no longer believe

in my lifetime I don't know but yeah I I Believe the country's breaking up yeah I think things are going to get ugly in violent yeah I think states are going to want to secede from the union yeah I think that that that states themselves they're going to break up you're already seeing that\nThis whole red state America and blue state America\nThat's just a kind of a hack neat way to describe the two warring factions right now in America\nRed state America the America that wants to go back to that's my life it's my guns it's my money it's my family government leave me alone blue state America those people who would fashion and design us\nLike one of these European socialist democracies\nWith a very big active government that takes from us that takes a lot from us\nAnd then in theory does

Believe that\nAnd I think I think\nThe very notion and\nI I I get this from even people on my side uh\nIndependents and conservatives and libertarians are the very notion that America can and will never be United again\n\nHell yeah that's a a that's a scary proposition\n\nBut do you use your imagination okay I think a lotta people lighting most people in this country don't really understand what the country's going through right now use your imagination\nThree four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen Years ago nobody would have thought we'd elect somebody like Donald

um [noise] why why don't\nConservatives\nAh teach [noise]\nGet into academia\nBitch true right if you look at pretty much any school\nFrom grade school to high school to college eighty Ninety percent of the teachers in the professors are on the left\nThey're all lives\nBut they were all Brock Obama supporters they all voted for Hillary Clinton\nThey generally all believe in government run health care in a pathway to citizenship for illegals they're on the left\n\nPeople on the left teach in our schools you know what\nYou've read about it you've heard about it you've seen the polling you've seen the data you raise your kids you experienced it first hand most teachers are Democrats why why is that\nA friend last night asked me that\nAh she's got younger kids grade school and high school minor old old [laughter] grown up beyond college\nUm and he's experiencing that right now\nHe's frustrated with a is\nA kid's a child's high school teachers and his children's grade schoolteachers\nAnd he told me a ... the ones in high school especially\nThey can't stand Trump\nAnd a according to his son village voice their displeasure of Trump\nOr more than just on occasion in the classroom\n\nAnd his kids his kids grade schoolteachers he laughs he just says they're like hardcore left he's and he asked me why is that the case I said he said it's probably in easy obvious answer but how come\nYou pretty much all teachers are Democrats not all but pretty much all why is that I told them it's the answer is pretty simple\nConservatives don't get into teaching conservatives generally go into business and want to make money\nThat's it and that's not going to change until people\nWho um are on the right side of the aisle decide that they want to teach me never change\nThat may never change but that's the short answer\nRepublicans and conservatives generally don't go into that field\nAnd they don't go into that field generally a because they'd rather make more money and I got no problem with that [laughter]\nI mean a a lives lives tend to go into teaching conservatives tend to go into business\nTo make money lives or don't want to have to compete and they just kind of want to do good or whatever\nBut that's that's the short answer\nAndy I mean he pressed me a little bit and come out why don't it's not just money why don't conservatives\nGet into the teaching profession\nI said I it it is primarily financial\n\nBack on my experience and I look back on people I knew\n\nAnd it was pretty clear like high school in those specially in college\nOr people who thought like I did a they they majored in some sort of business field\nOr they were going to go to law school or they were going to go to business school\nOr they were going to go work on the board of trade they're going to be a traitor they were going to be an investor they were going to if they were going to go into business\n\nAnd a few people I knew who were hardcore Democrats\nWell you saw them um look more at like the liberal arts stuff\nUm to teach to study\nTo go to graduate school and get a a masters in a PHD in history to be a social worker and those sorts of fields\nGenerally attract attracted and still attract people on the left and that's that's that's what we're up against how does that change\nWhy I'd I don't know that it does a unless the financials\nAcademia change\nI think it's always going to be the case that Seventy eighty Ninety percent\nOf people in the teaching profession are going to be left of center\n... ... it's not enough of a free market\nWhere you can go into those professions into those fields and make a decent amount of money and make it worth it so I don't see it changing and I'm not necessarily saying that should I'm not going to try to\nDissuade\nYoung conservatives from going out there and the business and making a killing trying to make a lot of money\n[noise] nothing wrong with that that is the American way\n\nBut the only way it does change is if teaching does become more competitive\nMore of a market\nUm thereby\nDrawing more people from our side into that profession\n\nBut I don't see that happening and so\nWhat do we left with than what we're left with the situation that my friends in um\nGood and that many of you have been in and that I was in when my kids were younger\nIt's a given\nYou know the drill is right\nYour kids are going to be taught by lives by people on the left to given and so you've got to do the best you can do to kind of try to balance that\nOr to help your child work through that\n\nUntil your child then goes off to college and get some more of the same\n\nAnd then here she's got to figure it out for himself himself or herself\n\nBecause that's how I can change and um we're talking about teaching but look most people in the arts\nMusicians and actors and writers and comedians ... they're always going to be more left of center\n\nPeople left of center are drawn to those professions\n\nNow I hear you and I hear others are\nOn the conservative side\nWho complain about this\nA joke socks on my kids' teachers are liberals but I I don't [laughter] I don't listen to the complaints as much as I used to\nBecause people on our side on our team are choosing\nNot to go into teaching\nSo if if you're not going to go teach well\nI mean you've got a right to do whatever you want but if you complain about on the left these in in the teaching profession I don't know that I'm going to listen much to you\nI don't know that I mean listen much any more to you until our side decides to get into that profession and that's not going to happen\nThat's not going to happen [noise]\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred a it is up to a U.S as parents um to do a better job of raising our kids are always\n\n\nFor\nWell it's made it possible for us not to be so dependent upon a few sources and those few sources always were traditionally left is\nLeft of center\nBut now the danger and there's the danger\nIs that we've become so Balkan eyes that\nUh we ... we don't share\nA common set of facts [noise] like if you watch
