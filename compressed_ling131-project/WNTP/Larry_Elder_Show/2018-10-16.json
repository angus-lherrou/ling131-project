Elizabeth Warren are produced today\nUm DNA evidence that she's got Native American inner she'd been told by her mother and her grandmother and her great grandmother that she was part Native American she told people she was part Cherokee all of that stuff\nAnd then you know in ... made fun of recalled her Pocahontas Trump keeps doing that Trump came out uh what what did he do he came out this past summer and said I'll donate a million dollars to a charity of her choice if she can do some sort of DNA test and prove that she's got any Native American inner\nWell lo and behold she found a a world renowned DNA expert who has determined that she does have\nMaybe like six to ten generations ago she's got Native American blood in her\nAnd I I really don't care about this ... am I Am I crazy 'cause I Know like this is a huge issue on TALK radio conservative talk radio and it'll be a huge issue on Fox News tonight\nI'm Sorry I I just think this whole thing is stupid I mean my God we just found out we just found out earlier today that uh the the deficit right now is\nHigher than it's ever been since twenty twelve is that just a little bit more important than whether Elizabeth Warren has one one thousand of a\nLot of Native American blood in her and that Trump promised to denote ... to donate a million dollars to a charity and and now that she's proven it Trump says no I never said that ... who cares about any of that\nNo you know what misty Devon I don't want to talk about it to me it's a stupid issue to me it's an issue where it just it makes us look dumb as a country I wake up Monday morning and the biggest issue in the world is a Elizabeth Warren might actually have a as much a Native American named her as anybody listening\nIts grass on the issues that really matter\nAnd I would argue you know silly me I hadn't been doing this radio thing that long only a few years so silly me I really don't know what I'm Talking about you know you got guys who have been doing conservative talk radio for twenty Thirty years I Know there are a hell of a lot smarter than I Am so I don't know what I Know but I I I'm going to guess\nThat a country full of people\nAh that that spends its time\nTalking about Elizabeth Warren's a Native American ancestry\nAnd whether Trump is going to donate a million dollars to her charity a choice right is is a country that will continue to bankrupt future generations because I Would argue it's a country that's not serious\nAnd I'm not going to do it I'm not going to be a part of that I'm not going to be part of that\n... you tune in to me every day to find out I guess what I think matters I don't know why you tune in to me but I Would think you tune into this radio show\nBecause you've had a long day you've been working your ass off

important to tell me what\nMatters and you know what a little bit worn being Pocahontas doesn't matter\nHow much what her DNA results saying don't matter and what Trump says about her doesn't matter none of that stuff matters what matters is we're bankrupt in our kids ... and we're doing it now with an increasing rate and Republicans are to blame not Nancy Pelosi not Chuck Schumer\nNot the rock Obama [laughter] you know who's to blame for the deficits right now the rising increasing deficits right now the Republicans in charge of the house\nThe Republicans in charge of the Senate came Donald Trump in the White House that's what matters\nThat headline this afternoon thank God for that headline so I didn't have to talk about the ... bits Warren and Pocahontas let me go to David David you're

are more jazz every time Trump calls Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas or than they are upset at Trump for increasing our deficits\nWhat does that say I I got elected because conservative grassroots people cared about the debt and the deficit\nWhen Obama was president and the Democrats were in charge we now have increased seem debt in deficits with Donald Trump and Republicans in charge and all of these grassroots conservatives don't seem to give a damn\nMan if I'm Talking for five years ago right now\nMy lines are lit up baby everybody wanting to call in and tear off after polo she or Brock Obama for all of this debt all of this big government man I'd get people calling in left and right but I'm a Trump's president\nShow new rules you can't complain about the debt\nMega mega mega you cannot

Know so\nMuch for listening you know what today we begin week three\nOf our campaign my campaign urging you to support alliance defending freedom I Want to thank you all by the way a for putting up with this right we're taking time away from our radio show\nTo ask you\nTo give money to alliance defending freedom the organization on the frontlines in this country defending religious freedom they are in fact abs is in fact the premier organization\nFighting on behalf of religious freedom all across the United states of America I Want to thank everybody who's given we're going to be engaged in this campaign all month\nThe entire month of October yeah we're going to take time out of our regular programming this month we only do it once or twice a year but it's important we only do it for good important causes and religious freedom as one of them abs has been fighting and winning for many years\nAlliance defending freedom senior counsel Jim Campbell tells us\nA it was started by people like James Dobson and Marlin medics and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nAnd so for the last twenty five years we've been defending religious freedom and defending freedom of speech around the country\nThat is right around the country and around the corner\nLike I just lost it\nUm I I shut up for a little bit and I let you all way and I didn't intend to do what I just did\nAnd talking to my producer earlier today the big story was how much Native American does Elizabeth Warren having her it's what everybody's talking about so we gotta talk about it and so I went into the Tonight Show figuring my God that's what all the conservative talk radio was talking about\nHow much of a Pocahontas was Elizabeth Warren and what's Trump have to say about it because he's always got some goofy to say about it but I just decided about a half hour ago I got the stomach to talk about it\nIt's stupid and its own important I I mean here we are and and I guess the the the poetry right the symmetry was beautiful because this afternoon before I went on the air we found out that for this past fiscal year\nThat just ended September thirtieth\nUh we've hit the highest federal budget deficit that we've had in six years seven hundred and eighty billion dollar deficit this past fiscal year and more on our way to a one point one trillion dollar budget deficit next year\nAnd I thought to myself well that's beautiful because that's a hell of a lot more important I talking about Elizabeth Warren's DNA results how about we talk about something important and I I\nApologize if I rented I didn't mean to rant but when I tend to ramp like that I shut up and I let you all speak so I'll let you do that now they marry around with Joe\nHey Joe I just think talking about the deficit right now with the midterms coming is in our best strategy I agree with you\nThe deficit is huge but I think there are so many positive things that we can focus on what Trump I'm listening in the middle east is a big deal you know they find out what happened to Shelby can change the dynamics of our relationship with them\nI think we can talk about that I think we can talk about\n... let me stop you from it because I'm going to get in the show being a little bit you're right that's an important one but just make me feel better show you you don't want to do you agree that the deficit these are big problems again\nYou prefer and we don't live on the bottom before the midterms but you're okay talk on the bottom after the midterms\n[noise] absolutely something he has to be done there's no there's no doubt about it but it er\nThank you thank you I I hear ya I guess my response would be\nUm every day every minute of every hour of every day\nOf every week of every month of every year we continue to live beyond our means and we continue to bankrupt our future generations and we do that whether Republicans are in control or\nDemocrats are in control

all month\nThe entire month of October yeah we're going to take time out of our regular programming this month we only do it once or twice a year but it's important we only do it for good important causes and religious freedom is one of them ATF has been fighting and winning for many years uh\nAlliance defending freedom senior counsel Gen Campbell tells it\nWas started by people like James Dobson and Marlin medics and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nAnd so for the last twenty five years we've been defending religious freedom and defending freedom of speech around the country\nThat is right around the country and around the corner\nAverage Joe Walsh Monday eight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for

border\nThey're coming again you remember what was it may may maybe June memory had a\nA few thousand the caravan remember coming up from wherever they come from Guatemala [noise]\nUh a few thousand and uh and they marched there way all the way up through Mexico and they got to our southern border\nAnd CNN and ABC and all of their media friends were there to meet all of these people who wanted to come into America illegally\n[noise] thin the Trump\nAdministration talked tough ... when then when you had all these folks at our border who'd been you know marching\nFor hundreds and hundreds of miles by the time they got to our border and the cameras were on them or forget about it\nEven the Trump Administration backed down because they didn't like that look they didn't like those objects and you know lo and behold many of you don't realize this but that last time this happened that caravan of a few thousand illegals\nComing to our border believing that they had a right to come into this country the vast majority of them in fact\n[noise] did come into America and the vast majority of them in fact our our here\nA lot of people don't realize that but they're here in fact a lot of people don't realize that catch and release is back I hate to say it I hate\nTo lay that down in front of everybody but catch and release the border policy of the Obama administration\nIt's being practiced right now by the Trump Administration they don't want you to know that\nBecause the Trump Administration wants you to believe that they are tough on the border and they're different than the Obama administration I think they want to be different they want to be tougher but in reality they're not\nTrump pet his separation policy awhile back right adults in childhood kids separated a at a border and again the media the cameras got a hold of that\n\nThe PR which horrible even the Republicans complained and the Trump Administration back down and very quietly very quietly moved right back in to catch and release where\nYou know what the deal is is you you you come into this country illegally\n\nYour detained for twenty four hours your then\nGiven some sort of hearing date for two three four months down the road and you are released into our country\nAnd the vast majority of these folks never ever ever show up for the court hearing and so the vast majority of these folks ended up\nStaying in America illegally\nFor ever\nAnd that's what's happening again right now who to blame\nWill come on now\nYou you you've got to blame the administration\nI\nI understand that Republicans and Democrats don't want us to get tough on the border but the Trump Administration said that they would show if they're not who you're going to blame\n\nThe whole thing is just miss defined to me 'cause I don't believe in the separation policy at our border I certainly don't believe in catch and release to me out policy at the borders pretty simple\n[noise] you don't let him in to begin with period\nYou don't detain them in some facility together you don't detain them in some facility separated\nYou don't detain them at all if somebody knocks on our door and they want to come into our country illegally you say respectfully no can't do that won't do that\nAnd there's no problem of detention there is no problem of separating kids and adults because you do the humane thing and you just don't let them in at all\nBut that's an option that\nEven the Trump Administration seems to have no interest in\n\nThem so we play this dance ... we're going to do once they come into our country think about that\n\nWhat are we going to do once they come into our country that's what we discuss that's what we debate that's what we try to figure out instead of a deciding that they're not going to come into the country at all\n\nThings mean spirited cold hearted is it really is that is that really what it is\nDefending our border like that that is a mean spirited thing to do\nWhile I beg to differ\nI understand how the Trump Administration didn't want the bad publicity when it came to his separation policy at the border\nAgain we've talked about this\nWhen somebody tries to enter our country illegally you've got three options\n\nOption one is catch and release you ... you give 'em a court date and you hope and pray that they appear that court date down the road and number two you detained them\nDetain them together to detain them separately hold them for a longer period of time and then give them a court date and hope that they appear down the road that court that or option number three\nBrace yourself you just don't let them in\nYou simply do not let anybody in to your country illegally at all\n\nIf I were king of the world or rather if I were simply president of the United states that is in fact the option I Would pick now people want to people are seeking asylum\nWell there's a right way to do that you you go to a a port of entry and you seek asylum you don't just walk across our border\n\nSo when I say you turn them around and you don't let him in our country yeah and then you give them an instruction on where to go and how to go about trying to\nClaim asylum [noise] but you don't let them in this country illegally [noise]\n[noise]\nWells that we got to let him in they got a right to come in\nYou'd be amazed at the number of people who really believe that\nYou would be absolutely amazed that the number of people who believe that that that anybody has a right to be here [noise]\nWhen nothing could be further from the truth and nothing could be further from the truth but we are at\nThe end of the day we are so afraid of that and I I look I put the Trump Administration in this basket as well\nWe are so dang afraid of truly\nDefending our border 'cause ... you want to defend your border well you know if that means that means you actually turn people away who are trying to enter illegally\n\nAre you ready to do that are you prepared to do that\n\nFor most Republican no Democrat is\nAnd I I got to be straight with you man I I don't know of the Republican who would want to do that\nI don't know of Republicans who would do that and I believe that Jeff Sessions our attorney general\nWants to be as tough on the border as we can ah but I also believe that the Trump Administration\nHas blinked plenty\nWhich is why we find ourselves in this situation again see they pay attention down there they pay attention down in Mexico they pay attention down in Central America\nThey pay attention and when Trump first got elected and Trump talked tough I'm going to build a wall and that can lead anybody in here illegally we're going to deport people you know what a lot of people stayed away\nA lot of people stayed away but then these people\nDown there kept watching they kept watching they kept watching\nAnd they saw that\nEventually our policy was kind of stay the same\nThing so here you're the comic\n[noise]\nAre you ready to
