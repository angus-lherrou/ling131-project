immediately let me go to Jeff who's been hanging on Hey Geoff\n... who I think I really appreciate what senator Collins who did the day she took the exact right tell first acknowledging that something probably did happen to miss for but on the other hand bank while you know what even decide that\nDon't have the facts here we don't have a process where Rick that guilty people without a fact it was just the right\nTheir own or did it turn out to dry up Republican women and women that even maybe the Democrat women to vote for our intended it felt good job for her\nIt's a good point chef and I would encourage anybody and everybody to Google and listen to Susan Collins fifty three minutes speech she laid out the case for why are again for how what we've forgotten the last few weeks a qualified this guy is\nAnd again address seen what happened three weeks ago what broke three weeks ago uh she's where I have been from the beginning and a lot of people have been something happened to Dr for something traumatic thirty five years ago\nBut there is zero evidence that it was Brett Kavanaugh and you can not just based on that allegation uh uh stop Brett Kavanaugh from being on the Supreme Court law let me go ahead hey you're on with Joe Walsh\nThat the Democrats are going to be loaded for bear these mid term elections pat yourself on the back to night Republicans and conservatives\nBut then you better get down to work\nBecause there are still a big job to do 'cause unless something dramatically changes right unless something dramatically changes the Democrats are on track to take control of the house not the Senate before this Kavanaugh stuff\nIt was a fifty fifty deal with the Democrats take the Senate after the Kavanaugh stuff that looks less likely I think the Republicans are going to hold on to the Senate but I said last night I think it's going to be more difficult now for the Republicans to hold on to the house\nBut it's going to be really difficult\nIf Republicans pat themselves on the back the next two tree weeks and think he got November made I'll I'll just put this in front of you again they lost those people the Democrats in the left\nWho did not want Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court this was a this was an incredible fight this this paralyzed the country for three weeks it was our Frazier\n... book but for like thirty rounds\nImagine maybe I'll I'll I'll put it like this to ya\nThose of us who wanted Kevin on the court and we're happy now that Brett Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court imagine right\nNow if I'm coming to you tonight and Susan Collins said no and Joe mansion said no and Brett Kavanaugh doesn't have the votes he's been pulled he's not going to be on the Supreme Court imagine I'm coming to you tonight\nWith that message with that news imagine how angry you'd be mad Janelle pissed off you pay if after all of his cabinet goes down I bet\nYou'd be every bit as angry as you were eight nine years ago when Obamacare was shoved down our throats and I know eight nine years ago when Obamacare was shoved down our throats to Tea Party really took off and the Republicans the Republicans were so pissed off\nThat the Democrat shoved Obamacare down our throats the Republicans and conservatives were so pissed off that we took back the house in twenty anti no that 'cause I got elected in twenty and only because they shoved Obamacare down our throats\nOur side got passed and the Republicans took back the house eight years later in their eyes my friends\nAnd the Democrats eyes what we have done and we will do this weekend is we have shoved\nBrett Kavanaugh down their throats that's how they will feel and that's how angry they say will get a\nI don't want to I don't want a wreck Cuba's guys but I'm we're\nStill in the same place we were three weeks ago three months ago if our side doesn't find a way to match the other side anger\nWe lose in November we most certainly lose the house and we lose a seat or two in the Senate\nThere is no better motivator to get you if you're asked and get you off your couch and get you out to vote then being angry their side just lost an Epic Battle they're angry let me go\nTo Jeff Jeff Hey Joe how you doing buddy I'm good my friend hey ah\nYou know so many times over the past couple of years we've always been complaining about all these rhinos yeah lake flake or for McCain rest in peace but uh you know what if this was their idea all along\nThey just fell on a sword on our behalf so they can fire up the Democratic base and not so much the Republican base\nBy say Geoff that's an interesting thought let me ask you a question if ... is Susan Collins in flake had come out against Kavanaugh and taken him down that would have pissed off our base right\nOr it would have but I don't think to the point of you know that's that's two out of out of many right you know you've got Blumenthal got fined signing at all these I mean we we know that they're they're shady and that Schumer yeah Jesus\nBut yeah you know the you got all these other backdoor rhinos like Paul Ryan who knows who knows what's going on in that sense it and you don't want hey we can throw the fight and we'll end up losing anyway but will still be in control and still have our power\nInteresting stuff Jeff thank you man all I Know is this I'm a pretty simple minded guy the other side was angry a couple of days ago they're going to be more angry tomorrow or we need to match that anger in thirty two days\n[noise]\n\nThis is the Joe Walsh from rapid as Joe

McDonald a current and and raise the NYPD or some video didn't show that it it actually it was no need need them to live because they were right there in front of all arrive\nIt it certainly sounds like the video was key for the the jury and that's why when like the defense came up this afternoon and attack the video it just it just didn't resonate Deb gave me a number for Van Dyke some of the video\nIs sexually me\nBased upon them all the testimony but even for me to\nSee it Mays that's fascinating because the jury or the jurors have said the exact opposite I mean you can what are you going to believe your eyes or what [noise]\nWhat what Joe in so many cases in so many cases we have seen police murder\nBlack people on camera on video and they still walk away\nThis time was one of the very first time that we saw that the police were not\nAbove the law do you have the right and shit you serve and protect\nYeah but the jury said you went above and beyond kill listening to the jurors\nOf all races and you know I Am the king of chopping it up and saying black people white people there something that I Am going to tell you it was one of like in the very first time that I thought that perhaps\nPerhaps one time\nWhite folk could empathize with black people do what you said you saw murder when we're on Fox\n... flattering you caught me off guard [laughter]\nOut though is that there were a lot of white people who saw a murder too and what and and again it's it's again about having those conversations I'm so glad that I took\nTime to listen to the jurors afterwards because I have written 'em all off I was like oh they're going to definitely be a holdout white guy that's going to be like heat that black guy deserve to die it was the first time I felt like there was some empathy between us\nI I Want to get your reaction to one thing that the prosecutor said today that I felt was fascinating uh Devon gimme Van Dyke number three\nThat's not the self defense that is not fear for personal safety defending coming in and shooting this because why McDonald was not respecting the authority of the Chicago police department\n[noise] he he went on to say amazed that he didn't take the time in the jury a maze today said that over and over and they said he should have waited\nJoe I'm going to tell you in in this is something that you you know you are that wrist bend the thin blue lives matter\nThis was the prosecutor and the jury offensively saying that black\nLife matters right it was essentially one of the very first time because Jason Van Dyke pulled up and say well guess what got killed as a matter of fact not kill 'em but shoot him as a matter of fact\nJoe so many times I think what that communicate what we feel is black folks is that there is no value on black life when that police officer rolled up on the scene it didn't take him six second to think about\nAnything about require macdonald saw a black kid with dreadlocks and wrote wrote his script and decided he was ready to in the stores\nAnd and and that essentially that the the prosecutor I'm going to say you Joe I think that they were speaking directly to black people not\nJust in Chicago but across the country who have seen these murders ... and feeling like they got no just that it was a financially the prosecutor saying that black life does matter\nHey ... what will be the immediate reaction in the black community in Chicago\nYou know I think that we ... we ... I think this has been an exhausting three year process yeah first ... I think it is a day that we can take a collective sigh breeze pat ourselves on the back for maybe Fifteen seconds\nAnd then we got to get back at it because it's the we still are battling right now with the Chicago um fraternal order of police over this belief contract and they're still trying to figure out what they can kill black people in writing you know we still got much work to do\nWhat what I Love about you and I is you can say something as outrageous as that\nBut I Love having young because you speak your mind and I got so much respect for you brother ... and everybody watching every morning I'm WVU and amazed by man thank you\nThank you and thank you to your audience for having me is\nAlways a pleasure you gotta I'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere [noise]\nMyself only but everybody out yeah um we can say what we want about the victim we can say what we want about chase and fans type but what we did today as we made somebody a sacrificial lamb and we basically tied in the hands of our police department for ever\nAnd I literally cry today over that\nIn a bad day I ah I so appreciate your perspective into your daughter thank you for her service will do thank you ... ... thank you thank you for your thoughts in your opinion I\nI I'm ... I'm sad about it too because\nLook I think the reactions going to be stupid I think the reaction on our side uh I I got all the respect in the world from aids Jackson and I I understand that the reaction in uh the black community in Chicago they're going to feel good about this I get that and I understand that\nUm but like like uh the Brett Kavanaugh saying\nWas not above the me too movement and it's not about all women it was about did Brett Kavanaugh do this\nOr this officer Jason Van Dyke thing is not about\nA cop shooting black men in black violence in the city it's about did officer Van Dyke commit murder that's all justice but we want to create and blow out of proportion all of these other narratives that fit where we are politically\nThis is a sad day for me Kate I think a lot of people it's a sad day as well I'm not because I disagree with the verdict I just think it's a sad day for cops\nWill will will continue with this I'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere\n\n[noise] [noise]

now a ... Thomas she's the mother of a five year old daughter in Decatur, Georgia\nOr who was recently sexually assaulted or in the girls restroom at her elementary school why don't you tell us what this case is all about\nAbsolutely well it's it's a tragic but avoidable situation and when that\nWe've been warning about ah when schools adopt policies that violate the those privacy and taking their student there's consequences to that and that's exactly what happened here in twenty six teams the ... the cater school board or without any notice to parents\nFor Under Cover of darkness passes a policy that says a boy you could say I identify as a girl that claim to be as a girl they can use for girls showers locker rooms restrooms and writes for supper girl identifies as a boy\nI'm when parents have been discovered this there was a lot of outcry a lot of parents than we are concerned about this we're concerned that it's going to violate our students' safety and privacy but at the school ignored all of those concerned ignored the concerns of parents\nAnd what unfortunately happen was and the November of last year a cautious daughter was a excuse to use the restroom while she was in there a boy that identifies as as gender fluid a whiz excuse to go in there as well and sexually assaulted her while she was in there [noise]\nUm the school the parents recorded this at school and the school [noise] been very little when their spots on it did not change its policy it did not even a transfer\nThe boy involved into a different classroom just so there wasn't a hostile environment for ... daughter a rather off your daughter which left in this environment there and that's what ultimately lead to a U.S reaching out to the department of vegetation and piling the compliant\n... everybody listening to us right now would be fairly shocked we shouldn't be a again you've got to school here with a policy that would allow\nA a a five year old who's gender fluid should pick the restroom he wanted to use so the school allowed this gender fluids five year old into the girls restrooms that crushed\nThat's exactly right their policy allow that that's where this young boy with allowed to use them for this was all consistent with the school's policy that they had been the same thing for months and months and months despite parents outcry over things like this potentially happening under the policy\nIn ... when you see cases like this in our schools the whole this whole restroom business the gender business our parents shut out of these policies like they have no decision making in these policies\nQuite often that's exactly what happened and sometimes you get school board that will have a public discussion but then ignore the concerns of students and parents\nUh we have other situations like this where there is no discussion the policy was\nUltimately announced on Facebook page and then where another parents of course learned about it but there is definitely a sigh a ignoring the voices of students and parents that are raising a very legitimate concerns about these policies in the dangers that accompanied him\nMatch sharp is the senior counsel with alliance

Seventeen\nWere you surprised by the school's reaction that they really didn't do much\nI was actually I think we all learn that at the very least you would expect the school to a separate the students that could have been different classrooms um something got adjusted policy take some steps to make sure something like this doesn't happen again and what ... where there was\nNo we're not taking about policy and yeah they're heard her daughter still being\nIn an environment where she's she's\nAttention exposed to this boy again and again and again and it was just a lack of of compassion and responses from the school district to all of this and I think that's what ultimately led to the federal department of education getting involved and looking at the wait a second we're not sure that the school with living up to all of its responsibilities\nUnder federal law I spot to like\nShow you all at alliance defending freedom you submitted a complaint on behalf of Pasha with the U.S department of education what Matt what can we expect what will the department of education do what are they going to look at\nThey have the authority to investigate these types of claims under title nine and were you know they'll obviously be doing interviews and things like that and we're hoping that they're going to take some\nConcrete steps in and get some clear directions for the school to say you were violating your obligations under federal law unless you make some concrete changes and and perhaps those changes would provide a\nI indict host for other school districts of of what their obligations are and and give a warning to school when you ignore or these types of concern when you asked and continue to push policies that compromise the safety and privacy of students at the federal government's going to come in and it's going to step in on behalf of students and parents make sure that their rights are being protected\nIf everybody listening to ... and I right now if you
