wall off all ... will ... will call the ... the recall law often shown over the balls to use ... mobile ... to ...\nYou said a very well Richard let's go you know Claire Wisconsin to Ken Ken you're on with mark\n[noise] um yes I voted for President Trump simply because he said he was going to drain the swamp it didn't mean if you were a Democrat or Republican you were banned the restraint and you're you're out and make America great again\nAnd it didn't matter what side you're on but if you were bad and all these people that are against them\nAre wondering like little dogs which are dealing with three or like\nThat and I think the Democrats overplay their hand let's go to Joe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania you're on with mark\nHey mark I just don't understand I Can't get this through my head why Hillary Clinton isn't being held accountable when she openly called for civil unrest last week um until the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience\nGo wackos are going to come out of the woodwork and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but Joe she's on the other side chicken say anything she wants [laughter] right [laughter] I you know what\nIt it hit me the other day as far as that ... concern out how to eliminate\nAll media coverage or say hey we're going to let them in they have to register Republican in\nThat regard [laughter] would you not hear anything about the cabin anymore yeah you're\nA great point in fact a you know I I agree with you if there was any thought\nThat illegal immigrants who are voting for Republicans in huge numbers certainly even in a majority why do I have a strong feeling that the Democrats would be against illegal immigration like they were four years right there are a lot of clips from\nBite into um Clinton uh to Hillary Clinton all of them were against illegal immigration but now that it's convenient and they need the vote by the way\nIf they lose a minority votes in the proportions that Trump is seems capable of doing the words they Democrats are always get what Ninety Ninety five percent of the voting Obama's case if it ever starts to go the other way they are in huge trouble\nBecause that's what they count on that count as I mentioned the story would learn his mom that they count on just wrote here's what we do we vote for the Democrats they care about the poor the fact that they haven't helped to pour the fact that if you look at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like in inner cities none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side\nThey have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them that it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from minorities 'cause they don't know\nThey don't know that a lot of the stuff they've been hearing and listen to all these years has done them no good\nThey told over and over again Republicans are evil they teach you there for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business both last time most of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly I mean it wasn't a Trump vote for Hillary Clinton\nSo this idea that Republicans for for a big business and the Democrats or the poor and the people who and we had a court challenge me on that or for the poor and and the disenfranchised eats not true\nAnd that's what President Trump appeals to so many people because one of the things that gets them in trouble like everything in life there's a balance theory also helps them they know he says what he's thinking there is none of this spin and all the stuff that politicians usually do would you say one thing and then lose another way\nDue to a different way\nThis guy is different he surprised me\nHe says some things on Twitter and do you know to eat some things you wish you wouldn't\nBut the American people are thrilled that they finally got a president that standing up for the United states of America finally got a president that understands that free enterprise is the thing that builds everybody\nThat this is what makes America special it was an exceptional experiment in the course of human history and pro Donald Trump in his own way gets that let me know what you're saying she had

here and they're doing it in pockets I mean outside Detroit\nUh Minneapolis there are pockets\nA of of Muslim enclaves in this country\nWhere [noise] you and I\nWouldn't be safe at all being caught in in this country yeah I mean you hear about no go zones in Europe and the real\nThough the media denies it and do the media ignores it in the media tries to refute that ah it's a simple fact there are no go zones littered throughout Europe these are a Muslim ghettos Muslim neighborhoods\nOut where it's rare to find even law enforcement will go into these are neighborhoods that are run by Muslims\nOr non Muslims are at at serious risk\nAnd serious danger if they try to go into these neighborhoods\nI'm much ... law Muslim law Islamic law kind of rules the day in these neighborhoods are and again it [noise]\nThe authorities are loathe to go in\nTo these neighborhoods\nThere no go zones and they're dangerous and again this is the\nThe biggest problem well the biggest problem Europe all these European countries made was\nUh allowing all these Muslims in that's number one\nNumber two if you're going to let them in\nWhich is ... erupted\nIf you are going to let them in and then for heaven's sake make certain that they assimilate to your country to your values to your rules to your norms tier laws\nMake sure they assimilate if you're gonna let him in and make sure they become

wouldn't have done it if they didn't they didn't want to select to really make us pay off with a big big day for the alliance defending\n\nThere are really a couple ways to approach it\n\nA couple of ways to approach these midterm elections if you're in the conservative media world right now\n[noise] something's going on\nIt's okay like everybody in this business knows that the Democrats are fired up\nEverybody on Fox News knows the Democrats are fired up and they've been fired up for a long time every conservative talk radio person who you listen to they know\nThat the Democrats have been fired up ever since Donald Trump got elected they're angry there fired up ready to go vote we all know that\nAll the data shows that all the evidence shows that\nSo we can either tell you that\nOr we can ignore the the the the blue wave because we know most to you don't want to hear about the blue wave I mean look I got everybody most conservative radio shows they've got people from across the political spectrum who listen\nSo I got Democrats I got independence I got liberals I got conservatives that got Republicans I've got everybody in between who is listening to me right now but most of the people listening to me right now are Trump supporters most of the people who listen to conservative talk radio they are\nRepublicans slash conservatives\nAnd if you're a conservative radio talk show host\nWell you've had to make a decision are you going to be straight with your listeners\nAre you going to tell them that the evidence is clear that data is clear Democrats are fired up their voting at a much higher percentage then Republicans have been voting in every special election and in every primary elections didn't since Donald Trump became president am I going to tell my listeners that\n\nOr am I going to ignore that and kind of jet Li lie that my listeners 'cause I Know they don't want to hear about the blue wave\n\nNow speaking for me it's it's easy\nIt's it's a it's a decision I never have to make because I just tell you what I think I ... that's the only way I Know how to do radio I tell you the honest to God truth as I see it which is why\nSo many view now that we're three to four weeks away from the mid term so many of you have grown very tired of me from the beginning\nTalking about the blue wave I didn't want to fool yeah I didn't want to deceive view\nOr shall I start talking about the blue away from the very beginning because I saw the blue way from the very beginning by the way let me interject here everybody knows a blue wave is common\nThe question is how big is it going to be is it going to be big enough to take back the Senate is it can be big enough to take back the house and if not how many seats in the house is the blue wave going to produce ... everybody knows that a blue wave is come and the question is how big is it going to be\n\nBut see I've had another motive all of these days and all of these weeks talking about the blue wave I talked about it because I Believe it I see it I've seen that for the past Eighteen months\nBut I talk about the blue wave is well I talk about how fired up and angry the Democrats are as well because I Want most of you to get fired up\nI I I Know that most people listening to me right now like me you're a conservative like me you don't want the Democrats to take back the house in the Senate so I've been ringing the siren\nEvery day every week I've been Paul Revere every day every week the Democrats are common the Democrats are common\nBecause I Want you to rise up by ... I don't want this wave however big it's gonna be I don't want this wave to defeat us I Do not want the Democrats to take control of the house or the Senate\nAnd so I've been trying to wake people up to the ...\nAct that the Democrat vote is up over Ninety four percent\nThis primary season over twenty fourteen the less midterms the Republican vote is only up twenty percent that's a big difference Democrats are fired up and they've been voting\nAnd if our side doesn't get fired up and come out and vote on November six we will most certainly lose the house\nAnd struggle in the Senate\nSo look everybody else you listen to on TALK radio and everybody you watch on Fox News or they got their own reasons for doing what they do\nFor telling you about how fired up Democrats are or for ignoring that 'cause they know you don't want to hear it and feeding you the bull about the red wave the new that smoke about the red white\nAnd look I've even heard guys like candy and I and other people on Fox News who have been poop pulling the blue wave up until about two weeks ago\nAnd now all of a sudden you've got Hannity talking about oh my God we got to get out there and all that at all yeah them out there is a ... common these Democrats man they're fired up\nSo even Hannity even got people on Fox News or who who have done their level best these last Eighteen months to ignore what spend in front of them because they don't want to turn you off\nNow even they're forced to acknowledge the reality\nThat the Democrats will be coming out in droves this November the only question is will Republicans\nWill conservatives again this is a\nThis is a really easy decision for me to make because radio is really easy for me to do\nAll I Do I got this this microphone and all I Do is say exactly what I Believe every single night\nA writer ... every word I order through this microphone is what I Believe and when you just say what you believe it's really easy\nYou don't have to think about what you're going to say right you don't have to calculate you don't have to strategize oh my God what am I going to what am I going to say that my listeners today how am I going to present this no it's easy I just say what I Believe every single\nDay and I believe in my head\nAnd I believe in my heart that the Democrats are in fact a burning for war and they're going to come out and vote this November in droves and the only question mark\nIs will Republicans will conservatives\n[noise] now I understand something um what Hillary Clinton said yesterday that the days of civility are over and a lot of people on our side got bothered by that\nOr I'm going to play you a little bit of Eric Holder from the other day\nEric Holder was at a campaign event in Georgia\nAnd he pretty much said the same thing and I'll play that for you in a minute Eric Holder told a room full of Democrats baby uh when when uh when when when it's time for the Democrats to be like the Republicans it's time for the Democrats to kick\nA and steel and do whatever we have to do to win\n\n[laughter] no no no more this when they go ... low we go high business a thank you very much Michelle Obama Eric Holder told the Democrats when they go low we got to go lower I played\nA thank you very much Michelle Obama Eric Holder told the Democrats when they go low we got to go lower I played that for you in a minute and Eric Holder\n\nIs sort of getting abuse from our side like Hillary Clinton got abuse or from our son sixteen right our side we got our guy in the White House our side controls the house our side controls the Senate we just got to good conservatives on the United States Supreme court\nAh we've been fighting a and we'd been winning and the only thing that's going on right now is the Democrats are fighting back\nWhat's the big deal about that uh there should be nothing surprising about what Hillary Clinton said yesterday or or Eric Holder said last night\nThe Democrats are fighting back as well a reminder of how fired up they are and the\nQuestion is will are ... fired up enough to defeat feathers\nLet me go to Mike Hey Mike drawl I Love your man I'll tell you what after you got a spot on again you know I Know you've got to maybe or\nI just need to know where to go beyond the direct asking\nYou why how to vote\nA Reagan Republican on my jaw walk Republican which by the way kind of pissed me off you didn't run again anyway [laughter] New York where do I do Roskam idiot the other guy idiot\nI'm not going to I'm not going to punch the party line I I I I don't know what to do away
