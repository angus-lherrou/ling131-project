Indiana you're North Dakota Montana you're Missouri\nWell every single one of those Democrats senators said just may not be long for this world electorally speaking\nAnd there maybe Republicans were going to take over those seats and maybe even more maybe John genes in\nMichigan is he going to be Debbie Stabenow if you guys have your act together he will she'll go do that don't make that happen is Menendez going to lose in New Jersey he will if we have our act together so go do that don't make that happen make history in the Garden State go do that\nNo matter what exit you live off of in

it'll be something that will be a more Republican Senate than it is now an over in the house\nOver in the house listen let's let's go and take a look at the at the numbers on this in these midterms\nWhat you've got is obviously a house of representatives that contains four hundred and thirty five people write some argued right now is Republicans to thirty six Democrats one Ninety three and there are six vacancies right to thirty six one Ninety three\nTo when you got to have to Eighteen\nAnd it just so happens right now that are about two hundred are solid Democrat or a lean Democrat\nMaybe a little more than two after about two hundred are solidly Republican or lean Republican maybe a little less than two hundred maybe two oh five one Ninety five so in the middle there are about thirty some that are toss ups\nThirty some that are toss ups\nAnd it's let's say you're really is two hundred two hundred that leaves thirty five and all we need is Eighteen of those thirty five now all we need I Know yeah [laughter]\nCan we do it you bet we can't if the kind of mood is the kind of outrage that we saw from non ideological people to to things I'll tell you to things that will help make Tuesday night a magnificent\nNight for conservatism a magnificent night for liberty a magnificent night for the constitution great night for Trump of course and that's lovely to but I Want to great like for you\nAnd for me and for people who believe in strong borders and lower taxes and and a constitutional lists Supreme Court justices\nAnd who don't believe in impeachment dog and pony shows and making Nancy Pelosi speaker again and putting Maxine Waters in a powerful position and getting cherry Nablus that House Judiciary weaken annoy us with impeachment a drama for two years no we Must Rise up and say no to that\nTwo things will help it happen really ... really motivated ideological voters real conservatives getting off the couch and striking a blow for conservatism that's number one and number two is folks\nWho might not even be that ideological they don't spend all day maybe listening to shows like this are watching Fox News or watching anything and they're they're just they just look at the country and they say you know what the country seems to be doing better\nAnd maybe that means that Trump's doing a great job and maybe that means I Need to vote for

lowering the temperature and and and even after what happened last week\nOr the evil hateful acts that happened last week I don't think the temperature is going to be lowered on either side week out from these midterms is what it is but I'm going to do something a little different to start\nTonight I don't want to talk about the politics to start\nI don't want to talk about who's to blame to START I don't want to get into any of that\nI don't want to start a Republican Democrat fight after what the country went through last week after what Pittsburgh went through last week after what the

Holocaust and this past Saturday morning [noise]\nThey were volunteering they were doing good in that setting the guy when evil and hate entered that send the guy\nAnd killed them\nI don't know right maybe it's not the most important thing in the world but I think it is this Monday Night the victims\nWe we tend to write when evil like this hits when hate like this hits we tend to gloss over the victims eleven people were killed in prayer thoughts and prayers not let's\nDo get out who who's to blame all which Trump's rhetoric no which CNN who's to blame right away we can get into that and we gloss over ... lives lost shame on us\nI'm not going to do that tonight we have plenty to talk about tonight I'd rather start right here Richard Godfrey\nShe was sixty five years old he was a

Semitism\nWe'll get into some of his recent obsessions in a little bit I'd like to read and what my lovely Jewish bride Helene Miller Walsh a road over the weekend posted over the weekend\nWhen she heard about this evil attack my lovely Jewish pride wrote my heart aches\nAnd evil and sick man walked into a synagogue and Pittsburgh earlier today and open fire murdering Jewish men women and children while they prayed and celebrated a Britain and the law\nOf Britain ... the Jewish ritual of circumcision was the first commandment given by God to Abraham the first two and is typically a joyous occasion\nToday's Britain ally ended in senseless tragic deaths of Americans who happen to be Jewish who were just practicing their faith in their house of worship unfortunately\nHatred of Jews and our tradition\nOur traditions dates back centuries we had been thrown out of nearly every land across the globe over the centuries but America has been a welcome home since Columbus first landed on her shores we have survived and we have thrived and we've been blessed here in America\nBy becoming part of the fabric of the business political and academic worlds\nHatred such as we saw displayed today has no home here in America I strongly condemn this violence against other fellow Jews and ask that all Americans stand United against the senseless murders as well as all other senseless murders wherever they occur across our land\nSo wrote my lovely Jewish pride Helene Miller Walsh\nSaturday hate anti Semitism\nCame together Saturday morning this past weekend in Pittsburgh the largest killing the Jews in this country in the history of the United states this past Saturday the deadliest attack against Jews in the United states of America this past Saturday\nWe'll get into the

F. and I'm very very grateful you've heard\nStories all month about Colorado Baker jak Philips being harassed or uh Atlanta fire chief Kevin Cochran losing his job but\nThose cases and all the others like flower shop owner ... Stutzman or just the tip of the iceberg abs is on guard all over America as new challenges pop up just listen to a BF senior counsel Jim Campbell yeah we\nRepresent a promotional print or in the state of Kentucky uh he was asked to prime messages that conflict to his religious beliefs and he declined specifically he declined a request to promote a a gay pride festival and he was sued for that and he had a local human rights commission that ruled against him\nAnd so now that cases all the way up before the Kentucky Supreme Court so far we've won that case but if they rule against them will have to ask the U.S Supreme Court to hear the case\nAnd there's the threat right there is the threat if it can happen to a print shop owner like Blaine Adams send in Kentucky a man it can happen to you it can happen to anybody\nThis is what we got to be on the guard against this is why alliance defending freedom is so doggone important dose of us\nComplain about speech and blame politicians\nThe country also needs\nTo grow up when it comes to guns in this country and I'm gonna I'm gonna tell everybody listening to me right now guns are not going away okay we are not\nGetting rid of firearms in America ain't never going to happen and it should never happen are Second Amendment are guns or gun rights are every bit as American as baseball and apple pie she'll guns aren't going anywhere all

so upset if all your listeners read that but the other thing is I just from my life but life for me I Can't understand how the leadership of a place like that and it's at the same thing happened to the church\nIn Texas for twenty six people were slaughtered yeah but you could not have a security plan and I I remember presented to my board\nFive years ago and I said what are you going to do with a guy comes in with a rifle you throw Bible Chatham I mean that's not gonna work we know that\nYou're gonna wait for the police come God Bless the police are now we pray for him every week yeah my place but that's where a target and your target I think you should be ready to do something about it\nAnd so we just trained that people get training you know good very good training thorough training we had people from the police departments around here volunteer\nTo call them who are trained and anti terrorism and they came and they trained us\nSo Ted you do ... what do you do now in your place of worship\nWell to not give away anything yeah we just we have people one we cut down a lot of trees outside so that we see you have a great vision of the ... we could see everything coming right you have a person's stationed there all the time watching and we had to several people trained and\nAre are good you know God Bless ya it's sad but it's true\nNo I said thank you thanks for waiting and thanks for calling for the life of me I don't know why we all don't do that look um we live in an open society there are people who hate\nThere are evil people bad people sick people were not getting rid of our guns that's never going to happen in that never should happen in America so the country's gotta decide as Ted said the police do the best they can but why why doesn't every church and every synagogue and every mosque\nAsk people in those places of worship trained and armed to protect people same question we ask about our schools\nWhy don't we have trained and armed adults in our schools if we want to protect our children I I get and I understand how there are synagogues and churches that simply can't bear the cost of an armed security guard I get that well then people in the congregation should be trained and armed let's protect\nOurselves let's protect ourselves there's no other reform and what happened Saturday you Wayne stopping so\nOutside of keeping our eyes and ears open and watching and waiting for the red flags and then reporting the red flags the only thing that we can do it as individuals in a free society doggone it is to be our first line of defense and defend ourselves\n\nNot a security guard we defend ourselves can't can't depend on the police they do the best they can we've got to defend ourselves\nIn our churches and in our semi got some ...\n[noise] [noise]\nWe look to them like their gods\nWealth said my friend Patrick wells said thank you I'm I'm just and I'll close on this and we'll move on I'm I'm just so\nTired of\nIncidents like what happened in Pittsburgh who doesn't have to be this way doesn't have to happen this way I look at it you you've got if you've got an evil white guy who\nWas dead set on killing black people it's awful hard to stop them if you've got an evil black guy intent upon killing white people look in a free society hard to stop them if you've got an evil anti Semite intent upon killing a bunch of juice look in an open free society it's damned tough to stop\nAt the end of the day all we've got these us\nYou can't you can't put a police officer on every block you can't put a police officer and every church in every synagogue in every school in every library we can't do that\nYou can't do that\nSo what are you going to do just going to wait until it happens again what are you going to do\nAre you going to prepare her\nThere was a time and there was a day in America\nWhere this was not such a why why all the way out there kind of an idea you're going to church on Sunday yeah they're going to be people sitting in those views who are packing and they know how to use those games that that that used to be America back in a day\nNow it's like ooh that's a weird idea notes that no not at all\n\nI Love to say it and they'll close by saying that again I Love to say it because it is the ultimate truth\nAnd I love to say it because I Love to put this out there in front of all those lives and all those people on the left\nWho who want to get rid of guns and they think guns are guns are the source of all the evil the truth is the only thing that will stop a bad guy with the gun is a good guy with a gun period\n\nThat grow up America grow the hell up and let's start defending\nEach other how about we defend each other\n\nRevolution\nHas been reloaded [laughter] you're listening

doing some during that's nothing but a good thing so whether you are ah [noise]\nListening here and do you have to be where I Am or cook uh Katmandu is great to have your Mark Davis in Fort Larry Elder from six sixty am the answer Dallas Fort\nWorth help all is well would you look I and I've got it keyed up queued up ready to go Sarah Sanders a wonderful moving moment then into the um and then into the jackals questioning or about why it's all Trump's fault but I'm Sorry I I just I've got a shoe on something and you're ready or the beginning because I'm just I've just absorb is myself\nAnd look I I don't\nI don't really care what is in Shepard Smith brain I often care even less about what what comes out of his mouth but at Fox News you have to know something and and I don't know what the deal is is there is there a a a a turnover in either the leadership change or a change of flavor\nIs it but because I mean Hannity still Hannity\nThe addition of shows like Laura Ingram the magnificent of of of Brett Baer doing special report a Tucker Carlson is just a star and and I just love it love him and it's not like I necessarily need all my conservative shows\nTo have exactly the same take because even as conservatives as Republicans ... there are there are shades and nuances and ... and things we we don't all we don't walk in lockstep like Democrats do I envy the match sometimes but but we don't but what about leading up to here\nI I just I Need you to absorb a minute and a fraction here\nOf of shepherd Smith\nNow do this and it's funny ... there there are the opinion shows and there are the news shows\nBut look there they're all ... ... maybe the news he is show that Fox does is special report with Brett Baer where'd you basically get a straight dose of news him at a panel of people have a wide variety of views who discuss it in that great\nHead of the conservative opinion show Laura Ingraham conservative opinion Joe Tucker Carlson conservative opinion show Martin I'm a gallon planet more more straight and and less of of of her opinion and it's great and they're all great what the hell is that it met our was Shepard Smith just who watch is that\nYou got the starship enterprise that may cover breaking news and and ... is a talented man he was a compelling broadcaster\nFought in the world compels them to do list today\nThe U.S will deploy some five thousand troops to the southern border as early tomorrow as thousands of migrants make their way north from Mexico\nThe migrants according to Fox News reporting are more than two months away\nIf any of them actually come here [noise]\nTomorrow is one week before the midterm election\nWhich is what all of this is about\nThere is no invasion\nNo one's coming to get you\nThere is nothing at all to worry about\nReally now\nObviously look what I Do for a living everyone's entitled to an opinion obviously this is a mockery of Americans not all of them necessarily conservative most of them probably are that right there was a mockery\nOf you\nIf you think thousands of people pouring across the border is a bad idea I don't expect that they're going to set up a you know and MS Thirteen headquarters next door to my house I don't expect that but you know a hundred thousand of them will come pouring across the border like some remake of a World War Z\nBut I Do expect that if we don't make a strong message that this caravan will come and if it is successful in breaching our borders been others will follow\nAnd I do not need weasel lectures from the likes of shepherd Smith about how my concerns are are somehow still is titled the view he absolutely is I Would expect it from from psychopath like Lawrence O'Donnell\nAnd and from finger wagging golds like Rachel Maddow I Would expect it from that\nAnd again and and and I just wanted to I I don't need Fox News to be a cheap\nYou know which we all suffer all for for just the same exact echo chamber news every day I I I liked diversity of opinion I like 'em but they they get they get this guy a show they give us thinking show every day to insult the Fox news base\nAnd I just want you to do it ain't by accident\nIs intentional they know he's doing it and they wanted him to do it why you'd have to ask them [laughter] okay\nLet's see here let me do a call and oh it was a break come back and you'll hear Sarah Sanders an Emmy media jackals doing after going after we were in LA rich hey Mark Davis in for Larry welcome how are you\n[noise] [noise] Hi thank you very much art I don't remember but here's my second but anybody listening to might go for it or or ...\nThat would be one year old I watch the news and especially when I catch a they've credit score I get so mad I have to shut off the TV and I have to go meditate\nBecause I'm not going to be used by white understand and I like that\nAnd he gets mad and I talked to other people and they get mad I have a real question here who created this credit score who voted all these guys\nDidn't pay them credentials and then how do they ever get to say they represent may\nVery well may that I Know that they and they and they know it and they don't care now and and I mean they're not supposed to quote unquote represent us in the way that elected officials do they are supposed to cover news in an unbiased and professionally honest and corrupted matter\nAnd the media have not done that successfully in at least a couple of generations and\nI or go have you not hurt\nAmericans want you know [laughter] we record we represent the American populace\nHello now ... and ... and ... rich ... thank you I mean\nThere are an opinion shows I Love the opinion shows the conservative opinion shows tend to show up on Fox obviously the liberal opinion shows I mean ... I mean listen I just took a little ... and Chris Matthews and that whole coven\nAnd and and and and ... and in that\nTotal head case Joe Scarborough but do they get to be over there on MSNBC and do the Trump painting fire of their viewer base of course they do of course they do when it's a free country and and there's a marketplace out there and\nAnd they've got X number of viewers and Fox has X number of viewers and and the trolls over on CNN at X. number of viewers and they're all trying to slice of pie and get as many folks who they can and sell advertising and make a buck good for them that's all just fine\nBut remember what reporting used to be all share a secret with these dirty draw close to the radio real quick [noise] I have\nA journalism degree I\nPull up I Know I Know I Do University of Maryland Nineteen Seventy nine College of journalism proud of it\nAnd I was at saving somebody's Abby I went and uh and and then radio news reporting in Charleston West Virginia soon to elect Senator Patrick Morrisey or it had a blast my first two years I went to Jacksonville, Florida did some more reporting before the talk show thing drops in my lap\nAnd I guess that's worked out well for everyone but when it was a reporter when I was studying journalism everything was drilled into us even in the People's Republic of Maryland was objectivity present both sides to try to keep your own opinions out of your stories where in the world did that go [noise]\nAlready and here's where I'm at a goes out for just second let you uh catch a couple of messages and come back and the message of Sarah Sanders is very moving\nIn the press briefing and\nThen you'll ah watch the wolves come after her there after right here on the Larry Elder show Mark Davis him today your eye back\nAll through all kinds of [noise]\nSort of the president said over the weekend that he could\nThat was he had any concern at all that his words\nIs certainly a\nThe president wants a homeless for our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days have find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he has certainly I think\nFounders known that to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\nBut he's also finally attack some of the very people to receive those white farmers who was mourning suggesting that the news media is responsible for for the anger is\nHow does he do that when the pipe bomb or this was somebody who wins the Trump rallies this is somebody ought to ban covered\nA tax on the media praised for for the president on either the shooter in Pittsburgh is somebody who was of\nPresidents with so much time talking about what why is he out there\nWhen you say spring you country why the author\nVery first\nThing that the president didn't condemn the attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these rigs thank you [laughter]\nAccent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction so many people involved in this country the only person responsible for carrying out either at these heinous acts\nWere the individual to carry them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field if congressional Republican you can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime\nMan bam thank you very very much Sarah Huckabee Sanders toward the when\nWater ... will\nDestroy what Steve poisonous coven miss this media community yes\nAnd people wonder why discourse\nIs a is dashed against the rocks\nIt's not because Trump one or the occasional bar but he throws in a tweet or the occasional moment in a rally the entire culture of reporters editors commentators who said that we are currently led by a racist I ...\nHate or a a an evil person Howard Dean president of the states is evil president United States is evil Howard Dean\nReally that's why discourse is in trouble it ain't Trump's fault Mark Davis info Larry be right back\nYou're listening to the Larry oh there's\nLine when he when we\nWith us for a news Patrick sauce [noise] President
