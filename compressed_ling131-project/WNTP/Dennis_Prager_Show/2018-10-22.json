Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project merit tossed\nAside keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got some news biggest Claire McCaskill\nCharged responded to our hidden camera destination she attacked a video of course she made a false statement in this state that she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II\nHad brought you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh ... never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation\nAnd just to your listeners know our investigation McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and the cat's gonna bottles policies\nAre saying but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and McCaskill herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be a gun down to some type so the capital now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only does the staffer talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talk about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into the Senate will vote with the so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's the red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not leftist their their their moderate\nTo pro life pro gun Democrats external thing in Missouri than these like state so or this and that's the gay shouldn't expose that in order to get elected in order to get elected\nYou have to lie to people and that's what our staffers are saying he's saying the moderates we'll just have to get over being allied can be very devastating very powerful\nI mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because of the ball hitting US Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling her liar\nHere is Claire McCaskill's response James okay\nWell and some startling Josh how I Would be part of fraud gently in betting on me and my campaign\nUm he's the attorney general of the famous Harry he's supposed to be going after fried not participating in it [laughter]\nSo um there was nothing there have been very upfront about all my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment really talk about this is how far they're willing to go too far in that have been my campaign\n[noise] well first of all it does it mean to both have lived through ... unequivocal falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I'd never met him and she didn't live on local pd in Missouri Larry what's gonna happen next to this other Senate candidate John always say that he had\nNothing to do with it chicken at respond to that so I think we're or cheating our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nHurricane that ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable and death toll is now past thirty Kendall

a regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher the house armed services committees are defence expert at a Marine Corps intelligence veteran himself\nBut get right down to it the danger zone has receded according to a radio real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seemed to see six districts will hurt Andy Barr Mike Bost Rodney Davis Brian mass John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory\nIt if we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and they sound pretty optimistic about holding the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... as we have around my district in northeast Wisconsin which in a surge in volunteers coming in\nWell coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to take up signs and ask\nWhat can I Do to help but I Do sense they light momentum shift I always thought this was going to be a night that when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other uh but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out\nOf a couple of states that look if you try to get our direction so again we got to run through that you have just as you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down the candidate quality and sort of that twenty to thirty states that we're talking about here\nLet me talk to you about some defense so she was first of all the F twenty to ten dull a it's a murky picture or I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a danger to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way do we keep after twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell and trying to read through that and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask\nThe hard questions of the aid figure out what exactly happened it seems like Seventeen twenty twos or damage I think ten of those are cats in the storm right in hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen when Lester rated hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a four to five little avert imported our fire I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here um but the planes are basic and those that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a budget that twenty two going into super cruise over Kansas is too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country so as best I can tell him talking to officials pocket experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired but the problem here is the skin on the plane\nThere's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive\nAnd my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frame appear to be okay\nSo we believe we can get most of them back on track but repairing the skin um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay out of your question you know why we're so many they're grounded\nThis goes back really to the Obama administration decision to halt the program a two thousand nine\nFactory gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground in the first place with their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts\nAnd a lack of train people to repair that our president doing the job campaign when candidates in vulnerable critical house and Senate races in Ohio he took time to praise the work of some of America's political and military heroes who hail from the state\nSolicitor civil war general Ulysses Grant was preceded by the mention of grants number one\nFlurry older shows on medium is used a semi to paint Trump as a racist\nTrump is being criticized for praising General Robert we\nAlways say that gave us a great president who has it been properly recognized OK William McKinley he has not been properly records it also gave you\n[noise] have general [noise] who is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise]\nYou know I'm Talking about [noise] still Robert\n... was a great general can you hear that he says so Robert he went to great general [noise] still Robert Daly was a great general she got that [noise]\nPan [noise] Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia\nHe couldn't be Dr really he was going crazy I don't know if you know there's a property lead was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln jam mommy I Can't really\nAnd one day it was getting really bad and link you just said you\nHardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nAnd like you said I don't care what probably as you guys aren't women [noise]\nAnd his name was grant general [noise]\nAnd he\nWent in and he not smell out of everyone [noise]\nResorted\nTo win grant really did he had a serious problem is Syria's trying again Rob but man was he a good general and he's finally being recognized as a great you know [noise] but\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared it's intelligent\nTurkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did what in the ... you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence got it buys who often work very closely with the Turks\nAnd then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared\nReally All right now doesn't impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stressors Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront the who these who are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome as being a necessary for the correction the middle east\nOr I'm not sure this had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish this whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begin to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accept certain moves on because it as an exotic story and reads like a trailer I'm Jamal ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long David Kirkpatrick\nYeah I think and I tried to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion you know the wall street and Silicon Valley or he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and there are no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nListen to the entire interview with New York times reporter David Kirkpatrick on channel review dot com coming off\nLast Monday I got closer I Can't learn that to me to be honest I don't understand their grievances against him and

my initial take high everybody not just stupid cows jaded mean but other\nI think a producing terrific people\nYeah been be so why does it now seven thousand have you seen pictures of the caravan coming in from largely from Honduras\nBut to talk to somebody about how ...\nHow did they get through the Mexican border the Mexicans just don't care\nKeep remain conflicting reports that it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred and forty years at seven thousand [noise] and it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long\nAnd again the question is how how did they just have such a large group trip through Mexico about that I think Mexico cares a\n... it was all substantial part of their population lives in the United states and phones Mexico some back billions of dollars and we take the unemployed\nIt's a coach hands I mean we're essentially were a ... government of Mexico me and my steak and the left

thing is that done anywhere else in the world and the democracy\nWe import millions of people in order to have you elected that's what it's about\n[noise]\n[noise] and they said it's a big question we should have some folks um because the big question here how are they going to be stopped she misses me my fear is that\nThere will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people but not go there come to the border and they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back a thousand miles or Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what the distances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add a feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSeats are fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to acknowledge that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSee they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just prefer California\n'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches was there was not landlocked to the bus to my knowledge so I I don't ah\n[laughter] I have to live in this may believe\nWorld that are on the left has created there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior in a moral way to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to fully vast numbers wonderfully they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful or equally wonderful or non wonderful culture get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin American American culture that's amazing I guess why are so many Americans fleeing to under us\nWhy should they be why should they be impoverished they have food they've perfectly they're perfectly acceptable natural resources\nThe reason Latin America is largely an economic failure is because it's largely corrupt\nAsked our friends in Brazil\nIs is is there a few as ... as intelligent dust trees people as the Brazilians but they're mired in corruption corruption is is the greatest problem outside of Iran on the face of beer\nNot global warming my friend's corruption but nobody wants to talk about it because it sounds like you are attacking another culture but I Am attacking another culture I'm not attacking another race or another ethnicity or\nRace or ethnicity or insignificant culture is everything\nSo I I don't know what will happen at the border I I don't know how they will be stopped they have but otherwise if you want them in you are aligned to yourself and to everybody else if you deny your for open borders seven thousand people want to come in\nThat seven thousand more voters plus there plus their families the this is for the Democrats this is awesome\nI listen to the political pundits who are divided\nOn this well this will be seen being good and we were approaching this hugely hugely nation changing

better for Republicans that's the answer but the point is they will undoubtedly be somebody will get hurt I it's very hard to imagine\nNo young man is going a scuffle with any American border enforcement agent and then get hurt and and perhaps a child they will be more cameras there as many cameras there was\nPeople and then they will be or they will be the usual from the left look what

they're going to elect Democrats\n[laughter]\n... what is what is their excuse because they feel sorry for these people\nThat that is not ... you can't make policy like that it's the end of the United states because you would feel sorry for the entire ... or not entire but the vast majority of humanity\nAnd then they won't be a United States the reason the United states is prosperous it's because of of values\nThat the left wishes to destroy and we will not replace with refugees from anywhere in the world nobody almost nobody there are obviously wonderful individual exceptions bring American values into America\nPiece of the guys who who supported the president do send billions to we to the Iranian regime that screams death to America\nBut this is classic classic left reward our enemies and and ah you were in eight on our friends this classic 'cause just sick world but the world but the left it's morally sick\nI don't know what else to say folks what should I say they're just have a different opinion and I respect it what would your what shall I say I I used to pay my in my own mind I debated I debate this what language should be used when when speaking about what the left does

will it didn't take five days of took fifty years putting fifty years the left is fundamentally transform the United states of America nearly half of its kids are born to a mother who doesn't have a husband\nIs added that she'd been left I'm ... I'd like you to ask that do you think is that a fundamental transformation you think is good\nI mean if you ask your kid of college that one if they want while you're conservative so do you think the odds are they'll say what's wrong with it that's the odds are they will probably say what's so\nIt who needs a father that's I I Believe that\nThat if you have a kid on the left of college and you cited this statistic forty percent of American Kids are born to parents who are born to a mother who is not marry they will say so\nWhat\nThese are just old fashioned patriarchal values that kids need a father or need a mother who's married to a man or let alone to the one who helped conceive them\n\nBut you go as an example maybe I'll do are rare tweet on that has a good example of fundamentally transforming America\nThat's what people should ask\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYeah soccer curl suddenly the point there were no single parents and his neighborhood on almost any ... do you want to live

[noise]\nInteresting experience [noise] five dealerships car dealerships Neal area [noise] and\nThe experience was essentially the same in each it made such an impact on my on me and my wife\nOr to speak correct English on my wife and me\nThat I actually have written my Tuesday column comes out\nTomorrow or tell them on this subject\nWalked among the things that most got to me was the lack of knowledge about cars that they're selling among these all all of them young mostly males a\nSales sales people at the if the car\nDealerships it was it was remarkable\nAnd now that you can call in I can pursue it I I had this experience with my wife were shopping for an SUV first time I've always just driven a car and anyway shopping for an SUV and I am very rarely shop for cars because\nFor much of my the last decade so I have been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way whatever it is it I'm now as we're having a new experience driving had in the wild card you might want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with the Internet I Want to know what to do it with a you know with car dealers [noise]\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance Rafah ... for four or five five were young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no when barest but I'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is all representative and it may not be fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey\nI could look it up why why do I have to know if that SUV can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the length of the of that or SUV versus the other one is I could I could always look it up on the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you read to nobody thing if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need to know\n\nThis is ... now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do I'm very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I Am trusting of the lines are working one ape Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n[noise]\nThat was a ... that was one aspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even deeper and that is that the\nThere was there seemed to be an absence\nOf passion I again I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales folks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these ah salespeople but again all the young I didn't have any sense of that but they were passionate about cars\nThere was it was they might as well have been working in a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people I'm not ... not a character challenge it's just the statement of a change that you know if you haven't\nSeen them in ... in a war you ever seen a young person a long time wow boy did you grow up you really grown because you haven't seen them see you see if you haven't seen something of a long\nTime you can see a change so this was a change that we saw a gentleman do you ah ... when we protested technical question our our launch working is what is

saw though there was it was in it and and then I translated that into as well\nThey didn't seem ... you can sense it in in young people and I'm specifically addressing men whether they they're
