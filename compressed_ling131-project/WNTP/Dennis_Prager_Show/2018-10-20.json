the ss the hunt for the worst\nWar criminals of history\nIt is part of bill O'Riley he's killing series\nI've been reading it emits a [noise]\nIt's it's very powerful you could cry\nAt times in a Bill O'Reilly walk back to the dentist Prager show\nThanks for in the book and that's how I appreciate it\nI think you've done a a memorial service in writing this and I ... it was I think to be honest it was somewhat of a gamble on your part because so much has been written about the Holocaust and about the Nazis and so so I'll ask you then what prompted you to do this\nEvil I'm seeing a rise and evil in America I'm Talking about people walking into schools gunning down students\nThousands shot in Chicago by drug gangs clerics um abusing children uh this just wall pure evil across the board and um while thinking about those stories I came to the conclusion that Americans are numb\nTo the growing evil around us and the only way that evil is defeated is people confronted\nNot turn away as they did in Germany I'm In the late Nineteen twenties in Nineteen thirties\nUm so I decided to write killing fast because we had written killing Patton huge success and we had a lot of research material leftover we got the Israeli government to cooperate with us on ss opened files that had never been seen before which is why we're able to put the reader on a step by step\nOf the abduction of Eichmann in Argentina\nUh we had a lot of new stuff that's never been put in print before so I decided to write it but the over arching is I Want the world not just Americans to know that he will exist and we have to confront it\nWas it hard\nAnd what they did was they said this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you set up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted cash\nA and they have assassins working for them\nAnd and the ... the organization had a rat line what Martin new garden I called the rat line from Germany to Italy general way Italy where they got these ss guys down there and put them on boats and then they went where they went most of them to Argentina where the ... government was bribed to allow them in\nAnd to keep them they're protected\nSo they're Red Cross out of Switzerland to help the ss so did the F a beginning CIA\nAnd sorted elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic so all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in the book and then the track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat and they had to be badgered into tracking down Eichmann in manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's no surprises all across the book individual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil which has been me my story since I was in high school so I I asked a Holocaust survivor men who went through our shirts the rabbi Leon ... passed away\nAnd I I was with him for many many years and I I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their seat as him\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the ... the one thing that I truly remember from my interview and he said they were monsters with human faces do you subscribe to that theory [noise]\nAbsolutely means as his people didn't go to hell university and they and they weren't people who were uh in prison for violent crimes they were\nFarmers shopkeepers lawyers\nWho before World War two live normal lives you saw him in the cafes\nYou wave that um [noise] they're all of a sudden the war starts when they sign up to get a black uniform in a death set in ... to put on their cap they walk into our was another camps and they brutalized people to the extent that modern civilization has never seen they kill babies\nThey gas women they do the most heinous evil things if anyone could imagine and then after the war they\nGo back to the towns and they take up their farming again it's unbelievable and that's why I wanted to tell everyone and reads the book and everyone that I Do these interviews with that he will exist and every person\nAnd you have to fight it you have to actively fight it or it can envelop you and if there's anything from killing the ss that's it\nI'm quiet because I'm I'm thinking and because of money for you to think about the\nUh so let me tell you something that I 'til audiences have my whole life the difference between my religious education and a regular secular education\nI was taught that my biggest problem in life is that is Prager Kennan

that's evil that's an evil sentiment it is and I'm All right to you that that could never happen\nThose interviews has been my reading to you\nFrom a column and nobody will go to a second column in the Washington Post they have a feminist column\nIn the Washington Post where are women the word feminist or or one I think in particular the feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them on the plane last night\nAnd I I should share some of them with you know some of the quotes I think that these are so important to wonder staying the damage that feminism an image it each make believe world\n... all is said emanates from the left or make believe socialism is make believe\nAnd feminism is make believe ... is make believe it's all make believe for whatever reason and it's all psychological it ... it's there's no other explanation there is a deep deep\nDeep uh\nUnhappiness\nMaladaptive ... to reality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who develop them they have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse\nOr is the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea [noise]\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation\nBut overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is one character is that the character respectable left remember from the boat to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen she writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a model leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she should they're interchangeable they have the feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left of but it is interesting that there is no mention in any of the columns by her or older women riding in this column in the Washington Post\nThat may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so lonely used to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the word marriage does not even enter\nShe's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a but she ... there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to his racial loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing\nTemporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what she described that I Know what I describe it to [noise]\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted a week long she said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that lie became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put in bold for myself but underlined what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug\nIt was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if the man is that the driver CDs a patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy\nWell and then she wonders why she's never been so lonely in her life because what the feminists like all left is living to make believe world\nReality it it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world where things will be better so she says if the if the man is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flag that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every move he makes fun of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this is they they have to say that they want their cake and eat it it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and relief not personal appetite and blind conquest you're going to move personal appetite from sex all the good obese care healing and relief sounds like a visit to a social worker or a therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy a different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October ... do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable when she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nSo she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh destroy the title but listen to this again\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional rooms that dating and relationships and memorably can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman\nTheir children left his two children the party they do want to grow up I Want to be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships inevitably can bring why don't you say that about anything else\nI'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that working for a living can bring\nI Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it never bleak can bring\nI told you there children there is no exception leftists are at heart children they do not want it to grow up growing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms at all of that stuff\nThey are snowflakes some of them are even my snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups does it amazing thing she admits this like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post how lonely she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI'm ally continue reading at that moment it felt difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of theaters feel stuck in the same dilemma really that's not true\nLeftist theaters are stuck in this dilemma conservatives have matured understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is a pain in life but is is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be at the end of may first oh\nBy the way just a reminder the amount of money or the the rational bibles but the white five volume commentary on the first five volumes it's been so successful the we're going on the fourth printing of ... is the first volume was on the second book\nOr if the prices going up of five dollars 'cause of the price paper it's printed on very beautiful paper so you could still get the old price at um at Amazon them if you want to go to and I'm just letting you know this is the rational Bible\nAt any rate uh I I [noise] that book makes you aware\nThat Jim is is this is what human beings\nTo grow up you have to leave the garden of eating the left wants to re enter the garden of Eden [noise]\nThey ever make believe garden of Eden in their minds [noise]\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six you are listening\nTo the dentist Prager show with Dennis Springer show\nFrom the relief factor of pain free T o\nI think part of it it's like I heard I don't know who their background but\nI thought that someone who may have had for both of them may be more strong feminist position and now they're kind of struggling with well I found myself in the back of me you know I Want it hit the that strong\nWill cut right through it yes I agree with you now that I agree with you know ... percent right but at no point the she challenged feminism but it\nMay be her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with this particular person maybe their evolution as well I mean I'm a Democrat\nI so I have been left progressive um conditions but I think when it comes to this and my relationship and kind of my\nSense of oh now you know I I Am a nervous they're scared to do that again that like human either\n... or whatever I don't know that that already\nAttached to one side or another politically is that\nOkay All right I appreciate your call very much a cafe in Torrance, California Hi Cathy\nHi Dana\nHi [noise]\nUm I just called to allow him a ... a story that I heard from a recounting from my son about five years ago he is\nNow how old is your son thirty two so he went down okay how writes us\nProbably four or five years ago I was telling me about a attempting to date and he said he found young women so aggressive\nThat when you're trying to get to know them it's a little like a job interview they want to now on\nHow much money you have and my kind of car you drive and what your goals are uh immediately you know not just a friendly let's get to know each other about a very aggressive grilling\n... so ironically if that's the case I have to pass the word is but if that's the case so the argument that men will see women as sex objects is is is matched by women who see men as financial objects\nWhich by the way there is some truth to both not necessarily a terrible thing it just the way people were built we have to live with that\nWe have to figure out how to live with real life\nBut then if you do your older conservative\nWithin a
