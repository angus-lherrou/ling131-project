I still read asterisk until\nI Love on Saturday that same thing that a lot of truth in those burn out that's exactly right so\nSo we created a fable is called Donald drained the swamp it's about a caveman name Donald okay all the cave people are angry because they say\nThe king king leaves in the middle of a swamp and he never he's totally out of touch with us he doesn't know about our concerns\nWe can't even talk to him because the swamp people up protect him he will only talk to people who live in the swamp what do we do so they go to Donald Donald is a kind of a famous caveman he's a builder of caves everybody wants to have built by Donald\nUh and so they go to Donald Donald can you help us\nAre they telling us that the situation is is well tomorrow you know I've got some time I'll go down to the swamp and see what's going on so we take a walk down to the swamp encounters a first swamp creature\nA lobbyist tourists and the lobbyists or says ... you don't understand you can't talk to the king the king doesn't talk to people who live outside the swamp he only has to be living inside and some so if you want to live in this well maybe we can work something out down says not interested I'll see you later so he goes back and tells\nThe cave people he says listen it's worse than we thought were gonna have to get drastic and he said they say what do you mean drastically use as we are going to have to drain the swamp and they kind of get scared like you can't say that don't that don't say that the\nHe says I don't know if the only way and if you will how you gonna do you're gonna get a swamp people angry and he goes well you're angry aren't you and they say yes and it's just well maybe it's their turn\nSo the next day he decide I'm going to dig a trench he's a builder he knows how to do this all this time and I want to try and Mexico is not going to pay for it but he says we're going to build the biggest or the ... trench we've ever dug until he goes by himself with a shovel down to the swamp now the swamp creatures come out one of them looks\nA little bit like Chuck Schumer one of them might look like Hillary Clinton\nI'm not being specific about that off as do you do you yeah the artist that when you when you look at it you can figure out who these people are but but they get angry they said we live here years thinking and and he says well we're the only way we live you either live or where we live and they say we don't want to live outside the swamp the people who live outside the swamp are uneducated\nThey're on cultured they're deplorable and he understands that you know what bully needs to do is dig the trench and ignore these creatures so he starts to dig the trench and as he's thinking the trench he sees that the swamp green color the swamp is actually the color of money why\nBecause the whole swamp is money that's why the swamp creatures will not leave the swamp so he starts digging and then the biggest batter swamp creature ball shows up and he's angry\nThe biggest better swamp creature of all is called\nThe George Soros\nAnd the Georgia sources really angry he has bags under his other than the he looks Hungarian and he looks like a billionaire but but the Georgia storage is really angry but Donald turns around and\nAll of the cave people are showing up with shovels and they say will not as angry as we are and they help him dig the trench dig the trench during this wandering while the rest of the book it was one of have to buy the book is incredible credible but but at the end of the book\nThere's a true teaching moment about what is self government what does it mean for people to govern themselves wince American style self government\nDonald rises to the occasion and he refuses to be the new king he says no no no a free people govern themselves and that is very exciting so they so he says if you're looking for president not a King I'm your caveman\nWashington gentleman ladies listeners think about the facts of the greatest works of fiction or about reality about truth Shakespeare wasn't writing fantasy players to entertain you he was writing about\nPower greed than
