R.\nWhich many of you've done over the years and I appreciate that fact pour you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter at the Marcus for show and if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis [noise]\nAlthough I must admit I intentionally use Facebook and Twitter much less than we know they're biased right and what what's the point that the film we go to print what they want right or at least the allowed to appear [noise] I'm In this hour I Want to talk about the disgraceful and this that has occurred in the nomination process for judge Kavanaugh and what it all\nMeans for me and you and for America\nFirst of all let's get this straight if you don't already know the left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them ... ... it's about the same to me these days [noise] yeah I Know Dennis has a distinction they will do anything and everything to when\nThey have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable\nThis isn't even the ... Ronald Reagan I don't know if you remember he would have drinks with the speaker Tip O'Neill years go obviously and at night and he said in what who were were friends what's going on in the daytime I said that's the daytime\nWhen he fought them tooth and nail out of course you can't have a drink anymore because that is now disqualifying if you were on the right\nIt has become all out war anything and everything goes\nNow lying is kind of place you know with a Senator Harry Reid and write Romney's taxes someone told him that even pay taxes and later on he said well you know it was effective right that's the issue is that effect if not if it's true or the total insanity of the charge\nThat Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang raped or not gang raped the least about what they're doing standing in line\nThey are extremely that supposedly so much so that even the New York times wouldn't print that accusation but all of it is fair game any action position is to be treated seriously if it is made by someone on the left\nAgainst someone on the right those are the rules so the salt that Keith Ellison I think he's running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota He may very well have made against his girlfriend\nIs running for attorney general the best of matter it'll do to save the shah was telling me attorney general it doesn't matter they saw the debt against his girlfriend if it is but he's on the left\nAnd maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which if you didn't know isn't exempt group these new rules only are for those on the right\nThe ends justify any means we're evil and they are right check that correct\nThey never want to be called right but that's all that matters there is no issue of whether they can go to sleep at night but you know why should they care because they know they're doing God's work\nIf they even believe in God their God is more likely to be the God of left this or anti conservative or anti Republican isn't that is their religion and it doesn't matter who they destroy there is no negotiating with these people it is their way or the highway\nHave trouble watching their allies this past week\nEven though you know it's the talk show host to have to watch that circus\nThey didn't really care about that woman not really she was yes center Booker I Would have said to you she was used as a pawn because because those on your side wouldn't have ignored a conservative woman with the same charges against a left this man you were using her\nAnd your accomplices of course in the media would barely cover it need I mentioned Kathleen Willie Paula Jones Anita Broderick the list actually goes on and on those women women sorry weren't on the left so it doesn't matter\nThey're just road kill on the way to power I wrote Sean I learn roadkill in Texas that's that's a phrase that they're the Juanita Broderick right right right [noise] they absolutely hypocrisy of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nI'm surprised they didn't have another Spartacus moment wasn't that at a Spartacus feet like didn't he admits sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other ... on the panel they talked about taking the high moral ground\nThese hypocrites have actually reach new lows ... alone the moral high ground every time I can think they go you know they can't get a lower than this they break new ground\nTell me that is my first question to you how you were able to contain herself I Won a prayer seven seven six these people's disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them in fact what I did was I was teaching part time and so every time a Democrat got and I knew I had to listen but I kind of work this out those little bit\nI I it's hard to take it's really hard to take\nKavanaugh was not even my first choice by the way to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nIf the pope was Trump's nominee and he has left us make no mistake about it they wouldn't have been against him it doesn't matter if Trump appointed by the way why didn't have to they need hearings or future FBI investigations when they know how they're going to vote they already know answer\nTo suffering people like Jeff Flake\nTalk about being name correctly you know as soon as I heard his name I have some doubts he said if you remember he would vote for Kavanaugh and hysterical woman confront him and he admits that was part of the reasons he was for an additional FBI investigation can you believe that\nJeff Flake is a fool this delay will not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats\nIt will further divide us this is all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham hadn't just right\nAnd this is all about power and I I and all of us probably can take in more easily if they just said what they felt\nBut they're a bunch of phony hypocrite left us\nWho disgust me tell me what you think of wanting prayer seven seven six but it's worse than that because we now have taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anybody with any crime you want and you don't even need to have corroborating evidence\nIt doesn't matter if they are innocent you can still ruin their lives\nAnd there are no consequences for the accusers because it's very difficult you have to prove that they did it with mouse\nDo you remember our Reagan's secretary of labor I think his name was a secretary Donovan\nWhen asked after he was found innocent as some charges I don't remember the charges anymore after he was found innocent they said something about where we go next to what are you gonna do now and he said something like where do I go to get my reputation back\nExactly where ... tell me does judge Kavanaugh would go to get his reputation back\nIt's gone now at least for a lot of people the Democrats and the left have ruined his reputation and some like Feinstein had the nerve to question his belligerence and demeanor at the hearings\nWhat was he supposed to do Senator Feinstein after you helped destroyed his life act ever so serene as you ruined his life and his life of his family and his dentist has pointed out we're is his bank account for all the good work he's done for all these years\nHow did Bill Clinton by the way stay is president after what he did with the complicity of views Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate this was not a good week for American I Want to know what you think at one a prayer seven seven six and I can see the borders already filled but you know I I go to calls pretty fast\nNow we're going to get close to the break but as for Christine Ford do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible not regarded by wrestling by Dr Thomas old saying don't confuse the motion with the facts so yeah she was emotional unbelievable but are you know hard maybe getting underway\nBut to judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt it very much especially since no one can corroborate her story she doesn't know how she got there how she got home when it was exactly by the way why don't you tell the others at the party\nOr anyone else for decades for that matter\nTo you know did she was she allowing a friend to be maybe right by those boys also I mean there are a lot of inconsistencies in this stuff are not inconsistent questions so now we've reached the stage where oh you need or allegations\nSo I think about this wasn't running hundreds of people from now on making accusations installing every nomination they don't want\nAnd looming everybody's reputation in the process now now there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused accused and accuse it's a new democratic strategy that has now worked\nI Want to know what you think you'd wanna Prager seven seven six I can see you're just as unhappy as I Am ... thank mark Iceland sitting in for Dennis\nPray for the dentist predator show for the relief factor pain for you to the [noise]\nNot the right word no yeah I I I mean it's\nDifferent than the other thing that I I Want to mention is and I've not heard anyone say that\nUm when they asked her about her ... and if she would cut from there\nUm she she talked about the present well she got some health issues I respect your health issues I'm thinking about this as a former fourteen year old girl even before cellphones next Leland word I called her and said well you\nKnow she I remembering sure ... miles from home\nWell I should get home one of my friends and you know I didn't she\nDidn't she tell her that she was reading or at least give her a call and say you know what happened after I left or any of those kind of things that they're into all that you're holding her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on\nYet what are you disappointed in the prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this is going to reach a climax and I\nAnd I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new drink and then she was gone my heart sank because I thought boy oh boy this is how they're going\nYou know you were done for and I was so\nProud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in guns blazing and and anybody that you know makes fun of him are crying or for bringing up his daughter pay I guess what are ... ... what would you do if you were accused of something so horrific\nWell yeah and but you can't prove a negative\nWell of course and you can't win because if you've been calm they would have said well he was accused of all these sort of you to do but not ... and the other St Louis to deliver it to be a justice if she can't win with\nThem that that's the point you did well ... thanks critical shirts you you can't win with them how could you win was um it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what the truth is we would these people's\nThe people's people thank you mark six that let's see some other great call let's go to um boy we're going to get that break Amy uh this is just this could be brief in Columbus ohio you're on with mark\nPart time people need high I\nJust wanted to make the point really crack 'em I just saw the other day I'm not sure whether it happens or not but one thing I think if I was in ... I Would be focused on the person that was a ... what was going on in\nThe lap pool laughter whatever she thought I was so terrified for the girl that I Would be focused or a person that was on top of\nOne hundred percent or so but the other thing was quick I Can't I Can't remember where I thought but\nWell I'll do it for just ... minutes that break you say they set up and go ... and I think they did let me know what you think when he Prager seven seven six mark I suffered in the spring\n[noise] nine Ninety intelligent conservative talk\nWith us\nOr a news on ... avenue in Washington and only a press conference at the White House defending his Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh he says he is empowering the FBI to investigate according to the dictates of the Senate Judiciary committee last week it was Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Jeff flake of Arizona the Pentagon ...\nHolding off the full Senate vote on Capitol combination for about a week\nAnd the president just minutes ago announcing what he called a truly historic trade deal replacing NAFTA deal that was sent some new trade guidelines between both Mexico and Canada both leaders ought to have this week to meet with President Trump\nOn Wall street right now it would appear investors like that new trade deals without joined a doctoral averages blooming it's up by two hundred and three points at twenty six thousand six hundred and sixty one of the high tech NASDAQ also doing well and so by twenty five would dance and people I've heard of about fifty Forty Tales that as our news dot com\n\nUsed on nine eleven there is a champion and partly sunny and warm and more humid dining partners ninth and I was thinking more animals to find some sun warm and humid tomorrow lady or evening showering damaged arm dining warm as the sun on Wednesday and time once again in eighty and inhumane remaining more violence on Thursday\nI any more bombs on ...

mark [noise]\nHey mark high [noise] yeah\nI'm tired I haven't heard anybody on their own doctor hordes statement [noise] she was talking about on the ... with her husband and they were doing [noise] remodel own a home and to remodel I think she said yeah\nAnd she had requested a second door [noise]\nAnd her husband inquired to her and so why would we needed that can do on the front of the house yeah and she clearly Michael meant that she was afraid that one day that boy that attack or might be a Supreme Court justice in two thousand oil when they were making that bit\n[noise] yeah but what's what's your point I thought you had a [noise]\nI mean I think it's funny that she would put that why would like to believe that that would be in [noise] why she already in her statement something back in the gathering oil white carpet when he was even in the\nWheel but he was a as a federal judge you know the circuit court or whatever they call that the the district court he was being considered for that previously so maybe that's why she brought up\nAnd ... you know even the whole thing with a ... you know so many years later they're going to come back and attack you so her answer would be let me defend her now that she was so traumatized by this whole incident that that that's the result that many years later and I think we need a punishment room for this because it's not a\nSecond according to the testimony from the counselor that she and her husband went to the red carpet we're having a marital problems then then the now the counselor and she had this episode\nThat she describes occurring during the last ... send a card for men wearing pop out her grandson on my own in Connecticut very perfect Nineteen eighty to stretch Kavanaugh so that's another life\nLetter why was she was flying out of your regular freighter flying well that's ridiculous she and her husband fly all over the world but that was another life I never lie was hide the fact that her brother\nHas their relationship what Peter Straub\nUm it's\nA little bit right now but only three people were low so I think that that needs to be investigated as\nWell you know there's an awful lot about the woman that was very\nEmotional I think that women really relate and emotional testimony mhm and they find it hard to back away from it but it was not that's\nTrue well did you hear the actual question is why not done Carol did you hear the code I ... a kind of paraphrase what Thomas ... said that you can't confuse the motion with facts right she was really good on that emotional level right\nAnd and a lot of women especially but others related to that but you just said it but that has nothing to do necessarily with it being factual\nCarol ... go go to your job now okay\nI Will\nGo but his shoulders are saying to me that people are so\nAffected by this or even if President Trump doesn't seem to be ... you guys are so do you see what happens is a good man he's a fine man\nBut this was really upsetting since the OJ Simpson trial maybe were struck by was on for Larry Elder one day when a district testimony happen I mean this is really hitting people who are probably ways in response to all this is you got to come out and vote you got to come out in such big numbers\nThat it it makes a huge difference is not enough just it's great that you know give me a chance to express your feelings about what we we can't let these people get away with it and since I mentioned Sondra in Florida go ahead you're on with mark\nWhich is not an object scratch\nA radio on so that's the delays are you there sundry okay I got to chew on hold because it's going to really make you crazy if you listen to the radio a jak in Annapolis, Maryland Jack you're on with mark\nJak yes mark thank you sure\nUh there's a point that seem to be being I'm not talked about and that was at the beginning of the question\nOf Dr Ford she was asked her how she found out about the party and she said that there was a pool boy attendant or a friend that was at the pool told her about it and and she ended up or you know going from that information she was asked who that person was\nAnd she said she wanted to keep the person anonymous while I think that's a key point from the fact that there is an individual out there who can tell who held the party and we're the party was because that person told Ford\nWeren't was now I understand the anonymity but this is a very important point we have someone who she identified who she's not willing to say who it is who can place or at the party\nAnd back on her ... who held the party yeah I I missed that part I was probably teaching moments but if that happened I it seems significant to me if you have someone who can ... your\nStory at least pleasure their rights and in fact maybe he knows what had happened where a lot better than she does rights that doesn't exactly everyone\nSeems to be focusing on how she got home but I think we need to focus on how she identified that part who were the party was and who was in there seem to be an individual who told her exactly that information who we shouldn't be able to find out who was then cocaine corroborate the whole thing or cannot [noise]\nYou know it's really scary Sean\nThese guys are doing a better job with the questioning Mitchell's where are you guys are asking and stuff has been some of it may be a little lost there but\nUh I I I thought that was fair game also and the ... one of my friends of tennis at the me something about how to cheat she said she could people couldn't hear her but yet she heard them laughing there are so many things that one could have asked her about and maybe we'll call her in the inconsistencies but it seems like they treated her with

and you'll find out where else Cy pure besides filling in for Dennis or Larry or whatever\nIn the last star talked about the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh nomination\nHearings and how despicable many of the Democrats on the left we're in our in many view ... they they're all trying to get to in a little bit I just want to for some other ideas out to you I Want you first to consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams here's the quote\nIt is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished\nFor guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they can not all be punished but if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned\nPerhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial for innocence itself\nIs no protection and such an ideas that were to take cold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end up security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way\nTo the Democrats sites out there know what their unleashing do they care\nThey're destroying one of the basic tenants of our republic the presumption of innocence they are asking for trouble they're also asking for trouble if they want to go back to high school and check everybody's teenage years\nAmong us is so proud of those years and where's the bank account of thirty five years if he even knows what he's accused of as a teenager I thought we at least the left I thought they believed in redemption and they had to get the left\nThat wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offenses\nBut now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high years\nAnd by the way I Believe you confess\nTo some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the Senate\nAnd I thought Joe Biden plagiarized while he was in college how come he was vice president and senator cotton tweeted\nCenter to watch this I knew about this but here's the tweet senator Blumenthal lied for years about serving in Vietnam which is all you need to know about his courage and honesty maybe he should reconsider before questioning judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nEven the New York times reported that this is me now\nBlumenthal has said he served in Vietnam when in fact there's times when in fact started at least five military deferments and eventually landed a spot in the marine reserve\nWhere he used was ... was officially guaranteed not to serve in the conflict itself senator Blumenthal ask Kevin off he was familiar with I mispronounced the Latin false listening you know\nFalse us in on the bus which the legal principle that dictates jurors can rule a witness to be false and everything if he says one thing that is not true [noise]\nExcuse me senator Blumenthal but that does that also apply to you\nOr do you have a six different now for lying I watch these hearings and I felt like I was living in an alternate universe tell me if he felt the same way if you're on the other side of I'll take your view and the other side I Want to get calls from people who disagree why it all makes sense do you want to prayer seven seven six\nNow not the thing I Want you to consider this in my home state of California I suggested on Facebook\nThat Senator Feinstein deserves consequences for her to ... and Republicans should vote for her opponent who may be further less than she is like knowledge that my brother another brother suggested this to me because what difference will make whether a leftist is replaced by far left is\nI remember years ago comedian Mort Saul said that voters are often given a choice between Tweedle dum and Tweedle dum are now it's much less innocent than that and what's the big difference between a choice between left and far left\nOne at least he's telling you where they stand and going for the kill all at once\nAnd the other is a phony torturing you slowly but surely\nThat Senator Feinstein California's going down the tubes anyway so why don't we let them get their quicker I live here so we might be able to pick up the pieces sooner some day or maybe they as they've tried to do they can succeed and form their own Venezuela here\nOr member Governor Brown thinks global warming is the biggest issue we face and he is the sworn enemy of President Trump so let them go to the left is utopia and let's get the pain over with\nYou think of that idea let's get Republicans to vote for senator finds things far left opponent and give her some consequences for her to publicity tell me what you think of that idea to add one a prayer seven seven six [noise]\nIt's time we realize we're in a civil war with the left for the soul of this country so\nYou can tell me what you think ... at the phone number that I just mentioned to you and just listening if you didn't hear the first hour they\nThe emotions the outrage that this is capture to the American people like nothing else I don't think maybe since the OJ Simpson trial because maybe ... ... people out there starting to realize what we're in a lie and they'll do anything to destroy somebody\nAlright I promised I go to your calls so let's go to Tom has been waiting forever Tom England or you're on with mark\nMarket is great to hear you substituting so superbly for that is I think and talk to you again I really miss your old Saturday Night show a few killers have\nDial well you you got to check face because I Do other stuff too so just to see where I Am okay what\nSaves

or pool is only one thing wrong you're insulting fool [laughter] ah I read serious note that Democrats have fallen into such an on the Louisville bleed Gary infinite lead deep\nIn moral up is when you disagree with your age are no matter what they foster victim hood\nConstantly they just said the constitution they hate the free market and personal freedom we know that in the socialist state of California and they are lovers\nOf socialism which is the government crushing people in the most viable way just look at that as a way like you have and mark my theory is if we don't vote them out as you suggest that we must\nThey will get a scramble whole almost in perpetuity on Supreme Court they will do anything they can to push\nTheir freedom killing socialist agenda and the future of this country as the once great\nBastion of freedom that our founding fathers created will be forever gone\nThanks Tom and you said a very well I can I can feel free to say this Bill Clinton's line I can feel the pain out there in the in the obvious and let's go to a I like Josh in San Antonio is question or comment go ahead Josh\nHi taking my call sure you know I just\nWanted to basically say that ah you know in my own reaction in any way to the testimony or at least for testimony which I think a Republican may have gone out at a little bit\nWrong angle I think maybe that they will when you come up you can't really question anybody's memory without coming off a little bit ... especially in a I'm a when a convict him you're talking about budget thing that they should have basically just said hey we understand that you're that you're you've been going through a rough time and they must have happened to you\nAnd your incredible were not questioning that at all I think that what they should have done it that\nIf the if there was a terrible situation to where somebody brought you have it in or brought you in a in a legit accusation but had no evidence what would you do and they're not giving our that option she would have no no chance\nOther than to say that what happened is that it requires corroborating evidence in order to destroy somebody's life\nAnd then if they could have gone around to that then they're going to be like that we need your help to bring some evidence that there is any evidence and then from there you wouldn't have been accused of not remembering\nI'd like your style that's that's that would have been a good way to do it unless you may have different or lawyers who knows and they would have had some objections saying she's not here to answer that kind of a question I don't know you never know what but it but I like your approach thanks a lot of trash\nAnd I knew you had a good comment there let's go uh let's continue the inquisition in some ways even though you know how I feel Jan\nIn Marietta, Georgia you're on with mark\nMark thanks for taking my call sure that's real quick ... one of\nThe thing there are many things that I\nI think that I thought for a doctor forward and her testimony but one really important thing was when she said after they decided that attack 'em that she saw a judge\nThe friend that was in the room and get not help her and laugh hysterically up out what was going on and she said when she saw him\nHe was very uncomfortable when she said hello what teenage girl\nOkay we'll give you a little question at the end mark I slept for them this for\nThe courage is not there this flight cause someone a costume or wherever it was an elevator on the floors of the Senate or whatever and starts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to suggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're\nWe're as the courage Democrats would give them credit for one thing they circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in that's been the problem with the Republicans do you really know what we're up against for them this war this is their religion this is their God for many of them a lot of them probably do believe in God that's not my point\nI'm trying to say this is everything to them who gets on the Supreme Court because they've been using it to legislate and I understand why you're so unhappy\nA someone says something about the less than I Am maybe they dropped off into waiting over an hour but let's go to Trisha\nIn Denver, Colorado Colorado Tricia you're on with mark Hi there Hi Trisha\nThank me neither of them are desirable\nAnd and I first moved to the left spraying an hour so relative to what tools drinking ... behavior that happened there even relevant get all we were to turn that Frank I'm sure that\nThere can be no for an hour walk and chew on a time period\nLooking back worldwide on being investigated period that the wiring back within that entire adult life so I went to the point and we should should jak and require it called the ...\n[noise] I I'd like it but you're you're leaving out the part I just went over they don't have the courage they're afraid of their own shadow that's that by the way that was one of the reasons President Trump is so enduring to so many people yeah it gets himself in trouble with his tweets\nPlaces like the first person to really stick up for what he believes in any you can't push 'em down you know and cut them off\nA and he actually says what he means catch some self in trouble a lot of times but isn't that what makes him so in theory isn't that will we'd been crying out for instead of these mushy Republicans and and a lot of Collins of Maine and Murkowski of uh\nThe Alaska and I mentioned in Sean just reminded me and Ann Romney goes ahead and says I support this week\nTo hit us why Romney lost I'm just going to mention that to me we're we're ... we're willing to do battle see the Democrats campus the left gets it and we do\nWhere Denis says it all the time we're in a new war it might be civil let's hope it stays in a sense that now there's no bloodshed although I worry about that very much when I listen to your emotions I listen to the emotions or the other side [laughter] scary where it's come where you could just make allegations and that's\nIt and you could ruin someone's life tell me what you think mark I suffered desperate\n[noise] into the dot com\n[noise] was\nAfter a news eyeball I knew in Washington\nPresident Trump says he's not at all top of the Congress will approve his revised North American trade deal he says Democrats will have a twenty twenty presidents or you could buy what they\nMight want to give a approval what he calls one of

around I don't believe rape happened and and not just because and and that he muscles her face if he was even involved a or he would have killed her a lot of this may be a mixture of lots of stuff fooling around\nA fantasies uh many years this comes back well I don't know repressed memories I'm not saying she's not credible if something happened\nWith him maybe ... you know I I keep going back

I don't really even permit let's all go on that she had to go to a counselor cognitive problems leading to endorse\nYeah and I remember that you guys are out there you guys are probably things you're asking you want to pull the per second door okay but you admitted that humid that you might be out there and let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania you're on was mark and\nFor you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter us ... show and you'll find out where else have pure besides filling in for Dennis and Laurie in this hour you\nCan continue to call but I thought I Would have some political experts on to give us they're taken where this is all going and what it means for the upcoming elections as well as for the future of the Republican\nThere Sean steel Republican committee men from the former great state of California you can't say that but I can and artist Steinberg political consulting pollster and writer of whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump a political odyssey will gentlemen I don't even know where to begin the callers are still there but\nTo the parents have been accused of surprise you even in the first place Arnie\n... you know if I if there were the vast right wing conspiracy which I was the head when she came forward to\nThat she would have been ... dismissed but of course it would have been ... with the Democrats were also liberals like Alan Dershowitz simply would have said\nLook if I were Dianne Feinstein and she weren't interested the blood sport of gutting this nominee a while we are mid eighties is her final swan song bear [laughter] when this letter came to me or the staff would have looked interview per say look if you want to be anonymous and there isn't any cooperation there it's a long time ago this doesn't come across\nThe threshold for me to pursue and I wouldn't be the end of it\nAnd the army speaking of Dianne Feinstein center Feinstein did you I don't know if you heard me suggests that Republicans in your the national committee men for public after Republican Party in California that maybe we should vote for her opponent so there's some consequences for what she's doing what she did the top two\nPrimary system is another unique the listeners should know that other disasters nature and California that you're allowed to vote for two people doesn't matter\nOnly two people ah who get the highest number of votes regardless of party affiliation we have no primaries anymore minor parties have disappeared in California so not consequently we get one crazy Democrat too far left wing ... Democrats\nAs our only choices for US Senate we can't even writing and it's a terrible idea Democrat activists say the Republican activists have at certain risks abolition folks love it and it and so what we have is a dying Feinstein or as a as a left wing opponent and Sean still not going to vote for either one I Can't even right in\nWhat about what about mark suggested ... here people are so upset I tell you this idea of felt like going to measure fights on campaign Bill Carrick who I've known for many years and say you know\nWhat you're going to have those is the average Republican voter the average Republican vote that's what we should just get it doesn't know the Kevin de Leon her opponent is more left wing than she is fresh so they're gonna viscerally react against blindsided by voting for the other Democrat\nBut you do for your people national listening to the show they say California's a wave of the future the where what this is is that when there was a so called primary the top two vote getters go into the general election matter what so if the Democrats are strategizing and take over your state when November comes you have a choice between bad in worse\nNow that's what it is that's why I say it's ... it's not only my idea of other people to suggest that if I think we should vote for her opponent and maybe she won't win\nRight if you want to be Catholic or do you say okay if she gets re elected she's in her eighties she's getting less less said or do you have to just watch the way she walked to the podium to talk to Senator Grassley their\nGroups Elvis not super high energy there as you get cavity low and he's a younger person who's going to be around for years so he won't have seniority that she'll have but he'll be a threat to us for a while I posted this on Facebook people are upset with me and they did say what\nWas ... that are dying find since she was like more or less the kind of a semi acceptable Democrat because she wasn't as crazy as as as her colleagues but now she's joined that that that group and now we're back to the Salem witch trials in Salem witch trials relationship disabled broad right I was gonna say yeah exactly\nBut this was an Salem, Massachusetts a sixty Ninety two they can you know there were ... there's a hysterical people that were making crazy accusations against a number of women there were hung a and they were accused of being witches and it wasn't even against what they did but it was it was their ghost that did terrible\n... full disclosure is I knew Shaun steel when he was in high school ... no I'm not you\nKnow let let that go I don't want to hear any more about that I Will do want to ask you though once you credible some listener picked on me saying all your talk shows are saying she had some measure credibility ... she was extremely well prepared\nShe's a psychologist she's done to show her whole life she's been practicing this role for for many years to come she had a group of very smart media savvy lawyers\nAnd no she wasn't I thought she gave a good story and that was affected but it was a great presentation but when you dig into and you see that nothing about her story her life story makes any sense at all but\nYou say that and I agree with you but are Republicans they didn't say she wasn't credible and one of your callers I think the key point we always start out by giving her credibility there\nWell you know because we want to be courteous ... not to be angry against women and and the ... and possibly somebody who was actually had this experience picks you got the wrong guy and she probably knows in her mind and her heart of hearts that she got the wrong guy but she's she's she's a tool often\nBut you know it's like our our party they leak the fact we are going to have a women or a woman\nThat question Kirk because we don't want these Republican mail is such a self to your your consult right so is that in a smart move will certainly terrible for our first of all it was a good move that to have the senators not grandstanding my I'm a you know ed Royce when each year the foreign affairs committee they hit it and ...\nAnd ... and I looked and it was awful but it wasn't that he's competing but every house member wanted to have their day in the Sunday or their Fifteen minutes of fame so there was no choreography no strategy no coordination\nSo they were wary of that I get that but why should I have to read the New York times or Washington Post is going to be a Republican tactics\nSecondly they never should have done the traditional thing alternating Democrat Republican and giving a process I Know that I saw a souvenir she was confident I mean I've been crossed with them if you have momentum you want to keep going so he do we have lawyers on our site as their US Senators\nWho are so and after that they agreed to this format rather say look all your Democrats could go through August up there when you're done we're gonna have are a personal question or\nThey should have had you there was a ... again the Republicans were in a bind there they're looking at all the stats and the polls and women are angry and they've been walking away a as a sizable number maybe ten twenty percent of women are walking away voting against Republicans because they think Republicans are but\nIn ... in this hearing ... I'm going to say something a little bit uniquely ... I like what Chuck Grassley is generally done\nHe's kept to tell you I Know and I have kept the tough schedule and look he's got a real problem at you and I don't have\nTo face in daily life he has to get eleven boast about Twenty one person committee no easy task and fake flavors flaking out so the whole hearing loss for one person in the universe was for Jeff Flake jumped like God is hearing any voted out and so I told you earlier this year and it was ... before he changed it I you know what I think it was born that way it's sad to say\nNow Jeff weasel yeah and then he changed thought it was but unless you're a lucky we got a vote I got to tell you something I'm grateful for that now flights got another week going on with us I think is actually good and I'm going to tell you my cold calculating political reason yes making my team very angry fired up\nTheir team's been angry and fired up for two years now it's about time our team wakes up understand smell the roses we have a nasty enemy here\nThey're about they're trying to take over the house of representatives\nAnd if you think it's bad today wait till you see Maxine Waters in charge of a major committee that's really going to put us over the\nTop ... it's very scary as you were to look if the Democrats taken Troy who would share the the major companies in the house it's it's a rogues gallery of I mean you when you see people who are going to be an arm stores they couldn't get a security clearance that there are people going to be having oversight or the CIA for ... or so the\nMessage clearly it's as I said you got to you know be enthused enough to go out there and vote and get everybody\nKnow you look at the at the at the national strategy 'cause we have a national leadership there the Democrats are counting on for example getting a few seats\nForty like let's say Dana Rohrabacher and you talk to conservatives in Washington they're not yet energized\nThey don't realize that this is a battle out here they just look at Republican registration so if you live in orange county right that you got to come out for dinner or what if they have now she asked national implications how few how she can do it late the different anti ... and I think average voters don't understand what it means when one party controls that chamber the\nSenate or the house there ... means that they control the committees\nThat it it is Maxine Waters there it would be fulltime impeachment twenty flat\nOut not only that Orange County as the pathway for Nancy Pelosi we got four seats at risk we got great candidates oddly enough of the four seats we got three women running the Democrats are three guys running\nSo so the ... so in other words we're we're we got the right demographics you've got the right approach or getting out spent two to one six to one and some of these races we need a muscle up and get curious and show up like the Tea Party yet in two thousand and ten so that's the conclusion we we got to get out there to all our listeners out there that are are women candidates were born women [noise]\nOkay was judge Kevin are credible that was a blessing I ah you know ... you heard the ... you heard the speech the little you know girlie boys at that that we heard in the morning but you know the terrible victim and she looked good she had to make up was she didn't have any makeup on\nA she had a nice smile oh by the way our entire statement was pre written and and circulated did you know that it wasn't a spontaneous Damon she she was All right now by her lawyers the phone she had she had rehearsed for several weeks probably for for many years of her life because\nFor some reason she got this weird obsession against Kavanaugh cabinet came through not ... with without notes and gave gave us heart and was it was a triumph but\nAh the ... and that's why he's a he's going to get nominated\nSean steel Arnie Steinberg your calls ... seven seven six Marcus are filling in for Dennis ...\n[noise]\nAnd my question courage you should have done this and wrap it up Dr Ford's number eight descriptions the psychological impact of the event raise questions nine the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely affect the doctor for it's a camp and I think these are all great point because\nWhy why did she do it at a day or the the first of all we all could front is that\nIs that we're ... these are wonderful points but our whole discussion is on this is on the the the the opponents turf there this is what we're discussing it sort of cattle that we have to do it there but secondly you know the reality is that if this were done properly the Republicans when they're going to have her there they would have been different form and secondly she would have had somebody play the role of this\nIt's a preparation is there to go to all the possible response to a good crashed cross examined an editor questions where no matter what the answer your model of quick you they know what's what's your follow up question goes a long one line or the other there and then wait a minute erupt interruption do go to there and you know look\nYou know I've talked to two to too many of the women some of been a had sexual salsa moves out there but the point that they all hinged on is that this was a girl who was not driving age who said that her her parents drove or places there\nBut she has no recollection of how she got to this party and she has she went downstairs out the bathroom somehow got home without telling you seeing anybody telling anybody else at the party like I'm leaving for somebody attacked me or I don't feel well or just ran out the door did she hitchhiked whatever why didn't the prosecutor asked currently I ...
