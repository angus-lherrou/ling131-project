with pain management we did not talk about medical marijuana are very\nVery important you know I don't always talk about it but it's definitely something that we do and it's definitely something that we do in conjunction with the neuro uh the neuro amino acids that we use for pain so\nAgain medical marijuana has a real ... it has a position in the pain management protocols\nHum we sort of dips so factor no we're probably going to use it yes and it's very interesting because again you have to know how to use the medical marijuana and I will tell the folks out there Dr cash gives an expert in that\nSo between the protocols that I've put together and the medical marijuana we're having great success or Aristide patients actually going on medical marijuana she needed to get a little bit of the hydration and first\nWe also wanted to do the stem cells first which we have done and now you bring in the medical marijuana peace and I will tell you we expect her pain to go down from a tend to almost the one that's what we expect in ...\nAnd I would say that when we're going to keep your our listeners apprised of this because we're very excited about how we put this program together and if people understand that the medical marijuana\nDoesn't interfere it goes to certain receptors the neural amino acids go to the other receptors and indeed we also use a sub clinical dose\nOf a particular antagonist since this is all put together for a particular patient in such a way that these things work synergistic glee together to get her to that level of pain\nHow do people get medical marijuana it's had a bike ride it out of my prescription okay New Jersey right now where we can do it in New Jersey and Dr ... yeah she she really proof for medical marijuana but it has to be with under certain conditions correct\nBut pain is one of the anxieties another actually uh we've actually helped an adult child with a two rats and also with um a a certain neurological conditions\nSo it

want to protect themselves from a coronary heart disease and maintain those flexible health a youthful arteries for one for circulation see they want to boost their energy wind not\nI mean we deserved it and that's what we're going to be talking about here today with this cruel omega ... plus which is the cutting edge\nCombination Steve from crude oil which is fabulous for us but we used the crew will not show important we didn't use the crew or with the high omega three\nConcentrated Fishell you need to do that when you're dealing with cruelty cruise cruel just isn't high enough and omega threes so many other important parameters are virtues you got to get that high omega three fish are on there and we've done that so this is now the best of both\nBut we didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've added some vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the amount of coral by sixty seven percent so this now becomes the finest omega three nutrient in the world as far as I'm concerned\nThis is very very exciting this cruel oil sensation I mean it is all over the news docked in eleventh grade studies are out there many experts are declaring that

whose ears don't perk up after the how exactly does that work anyway\nRight will crawl maker fifty plus remember this is the combination of cruel world with\nThe high omega three highly concentrated should also which is much higher and omega threes than most cruel oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the high omega three fish oil we're talking about support for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy you fold flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that stay nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little ... what about triglycerides that become so important so\nThis criminal fifty plus supports the heart in so many ways\nAnd you know the bottom line is we need to

[laughter]\nSo excited that you're able to to join us this year um it'll be you know we we keep it off the weekend to the conference on Monday Tuesday so that more farmers can attend a good hobby I\nLike the ...\nBut we also you know we have talks like yours um aimed at\nThe back yard gardeners consumers really anyone who cares about where their food system comes from that covers everything it covers things like a nutrition making phone gras I'm understanding the impact\nOf food on local economies raising bees all kinds of things as well as the more hardcore farming farming material\nWhere you kind of gave me a car launch to talk about organic gardening we're on to talk about I'm going to talk about something that I Hope will help to homeowners as well as a people with farms and\nBranches and the talk about how to increase production on food crops and one of the things about the woody plants show a article recently about a black version blackberries peaches ... did you read anything you know some of the more unusual things it's\nA there are some real simple things that people can do the will increase their production and cut down their pest control problem tremendously\nThat are not very widely known about it so and it's pretty interesting ... will have fun or\nSpeaking there the the vendors in downtown I'm\nA McKinney McKinney has done a beautiful job with their uh improvements in the downtown area I'm Glad you all are having the events there\nIt's it's fantastic it's like this is our twelve here during this conference and the ... my favorite location where we've just got were coming to accurate again\nBecause we're right in the old downtown near this dark downtown there's five restaurants on the square that source local foods Renault there is a large speakers you know we we have ... the chefs you know\nServing lunch at the restaurants than coming over across the Street's come ... you know give their talks about what they're doing with local source saying it's this integration of local food into the community that's what we're trying to achieve in so many places ... and the cage really taken huge strides had\nBullets really moving the right direction in my opinion I don't know I'm a you know I've talked to the people that are running for the commissioner or here in\nUh Texas we've had both candidates zoning and talked about it and in this conversation about certified organic programs is real head scratcher for us because\nWe we really like some of the things about it on the other hand the government's something y'all deal with the law the government interference in a lot of cases is a big problem and I I see more people going organic than\nThan going to a certified organic and calling themselves certified Rio seeing a similar kind of\nMovement\nOh absolutely I mean a huge percentage of the people who use organic methods in their farms aren't certified I'm One of 'em you know we were not satisfied that I Believe ... national\nGuard bleed the same way\nAnd I think there's value I mean I think you know when I it you know the times I'll walk into a grocery store for something that I Can't get at the farmer's market I'll look for organic you know this is there's a lot of value to that organic\nCertification particularly they're particularly you know when you can't talk to the farmer and to be on it you know the flip side also is you can't assume that everything at a farmer's market is automatically organic stuff that matters\nTo you that every hit that the dirtiest pesticide free you have to get comfortable with asking questions have your farmers pure and understanding it I mean that's another big piece we're doing at the conference we've got a ... a couple of sessions relate on different angles of understanding\nYour food and what was he labeled me what to you know how do you find good food what's the important how do you prioritize you know because it's confusing I live and breathe that stuff and I get confused by it sometime\nAround ... well you know one of the things that we have a problem with the certified programs that are out there is that when you you go to a government agency and so you want to be certified you in most cases you have to go through a three year program of being offered the pesticides and synthetic fertilizers ride\nYeah they don't talk anything about\nThe health of the soil quality to stop using certain things they don't talk much about what you should do the kick the biological activity up\nAnd have this richness in the soil going into the food which is what it's all about everything we talk about here and that's why a lot of people that are out there that that aren't certified or doing a great job because they understand that basic philosophy that it's all about the soil\nEither the government folks even even the batter intentioned ones and there's old age but even the ones with contenders for the most part literally just don't get it and I mean they don't understand it and we see this you know in the research so you know people will see these headline saying you know organic says no better for you here's a study you know and\nI you know or they see the research that says organics we can't feed the world people would start you know by the millions if we did our antics as because when the research universities do their study what they do is they take soil that has been abused for several decades sometimes and they stop eating the pesticides\nAnd herbicides and maybe they do a cover crop\nOr they just some compost started you know they do something and they do it for a year or two ... and the crowd that comes out of there it's pathetic\nWell of course it is [laughter] you you butchers this whole and and you sort of give it to this little trickle of extra nutrition and you think it's going to be fine in a year or two\nA lot of learning that since I started\nTradition and you think it's going to be finding a year or two\nWhile I'm learning that since I started doing the show there was a when I was a deal on the radio station for a while the the one of the guys the helicopter pilot that the the traffic report he said\nHe came in to see me one day that the guy but he was a he does not quite get what I was trying to uh teach\nKnow and that's the caliber of the research I mean that sadly is you know it's one thing from yeah some guy in the backyard but but this is the caliber of the research being done and so you know it's ... you know we have to be our own educators we have to be out there\nAnd be teaching people um and learning farce out see no protection what the real organic says not necessarily certified ... I thought what it means to re healthy food in a way that\nCan feed the world and support our environment long term sustainable in the true sense of the word and that systems can be built by the farmers and the consumer it's it's not going to be built by government because they they are captured by industry I mean it gets into a huge issue but\nYou know the research into political research money into political power of large corporations like Monsanto and Cargill enticed and they've captured\nReally and I'd actually that that term often\nThen last year when we study law talked about industry capture of agencies um they've captured a lot of the agencies and all that states who are supposed to be getting the work so it's up to the grass roots that can help it says that we want to say\nWell I'm looking forward to a to between their legs um go ahead we may run out time go ahead and give her body they're frightened about how to get tickets to get there and then the details of course you can go to the farm and ranch freedom dog or a website and register boils to people need to know\n[noise] um so the farming and treat him dot org it's the best place to go we've got there's a menu item that towards the top ... conference you can register online until this Wednesday walk ins are welcome even after that but\nIt stays permitting that it's better to register ahead it can be downtown McKinney I'm starting early Monday morning running all day Monday and Tuesday um we keep the conference he is very low for a conference of this caliber but it's actually much we do still at all in tears and even for farmers have scholarships that elbow\nOn and we also have a fabulous I Can't wait for it on Monday Night dinner on farm to table dinner ... and I'm\nGoing to miss that go into next year maybe we'll do this I Want to do I really appreciate it I'll keep plugging the thing I look for being with you and we'll see you at the event\nThank you so much our part\nThere and she thinks that Jews McGarry and she is doing a great job with the farm and ranch freedom dot org organization check it out and I hope you can be with us as the years ... under appearances on ... dot com\n[noise] you know not those suckers\nArgues about the size of a honeybee it's not a real big big\nYeah we actually know a little kids are little short short\nYeah well those are the official those are bees that are good pollinators and they don't really sting or anything\nBut they don't staying leave them alone don't worry about\nThe after we said yes to this year there\nAfter nectar and thereafter pollen and things like that that's why they're such good pollinators they're\nDoing here is never seen this meeting on this I Can't remember the third question as to think about how to get ...\nBack okay I appreciate it let me catch up on a few things\nThey didn't get to that too many things going on that first our uh let's see we talked about the ... the mosquitoes adding some kind of a a\nA oh ...\nLiquid molasses or a compost tea or the whole Garrett Jews mixture and making the what you're doing there is you're spraying the Beatty I the ... the bacteria killer for\nUh the mosquitoes which are putting it out with something that helps grow more microbes just\nLasted led to have more advocacy and last longer so give that a shot mosquitoes have been horrible this year and all kinds of places and nothing has worked very well but that we're getting good report back on using that technique in improving\nThe Africa see quite a bit\nUh some questions about the trees are kicking down all kinds of of leaves and twigs and bits and pieces all over the ground in some cases having brown areas of leads up in the tree\nIn most cases works really well you can be looking at two things one is squirrels\nSquirrels will bite off twigs need a little piece and thrown down there just are annoying as they can be we got 'em all over the place at our house eating ice curtains and the live oak trees primarily they're also in the red oaks as well and then really some of the current and then\nThrow it on the ground and just making the biggest mass you've ever seen a blow\nMess off a couple of times a day or in some cases there's nothing you can do about that the big brown spots that show up you can eliminate the squirrels doing that damage though by applying the ... train but when you see that going on you know there's a concentration of sugars\nComing from stress in the tree [noise] one year at the dirt doctoral cover a couple of other things when I get back and then we'll go back\nTo [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] without\n... news on Gordon gripping a member of the U.S Senate Foreign Relations Committee says the U.S Saudi relations may need to\nBe completely revised of an investigation finds the kingdom's government responsible for the murder of Washington Post contributor ...
