media is drenched in lie\nIs saturated and why it is swimming and why it breathes wise it exhale is why that President Trump in some way blood to the murders of Pittsburgh Jews\nAs a Jew as an American as a human who loves troops these people are despicable\nJew and non Jews lying about this using the deaths of Jews because they hate Trump they hate Trump more than they love the debt that is my belief\nBecause if they didn't they wouldn't use the deaths of Jews to crap on the president but that is their greatest motivating force of these people the hatred of this man is greater than obviously greater than\nBoth of truth the compromise of the ... of the Anti Defamation league of various Jewish agencies a bag of all of the left the entire left it's all lying lying lying place\nI've said my whole life the truth is not a left wing value of his proceeds Donald Trump this proceed to this is merely the greatest manifestation of it we are living through another left wing lying

the lie and lie and use that Jews to lie to undo this presidency\nBecause I'm doing this presidency is the Jewish thing to do it the Christian thing to do it the American thing to do and it's of course it to the progressive thing to do that's how they justify their light\nThey live in the beginning of the Trump presidency when they said that the calls the Jewish community centers were induced by the Trump election turned out it was a a a deranged American Jewish kid in east ... in Israel who is making Ninety percent of these bomb threat calls the Jewish community centers\nThe other ten percent were made by a radical black trying to frame his ex girlfriend did\nYou know that that the mainstream media report that like they reported for months or a year that that are that the Trump

All right so lumped arts let me ask why didn't he killed Jews accuse me Christians who oppose the uh the caravan and a vast numbers of immigrants coming into legally\nHave great that you're working you're working burger we would certainly agree element here but yeah there and and there's certainly that was the thing that got killed those you okay you can write your Carter\nSo if I'm right so if the president also if the ... okay if the president were uh were said\nI think it's great of caravans of about tens of thousands of people come in that he would not have killed the Jews in Pittsburgh\nI okay so obviously if you're trying to figure there's the correct wander one correlation [noise]\nNo no I'm just asking what do you think what that Margaret ... or ... what am I trying to tell me what I'm trying to say because all of our ... our primary you may know better than I Wonder what am I trying to say\nWhy ... why don't we date with Trump did say and ... and his supporters\nRight here okay so but yes so let me ask you a question what would be how would you characterize\nFourteen thousand that's two ... worth of people are using or would you call them guests would you call them refugee and they would actually that is that right ... yeah okay go on are you are okay okay are you for accepting them into the country\nI'm for expecting them under the appropriate or an hour or treating that go to everybody who wouldn't be any sensible American Kid right\nWhat what they are not what they are not what Trump and your reporters repeatedly you've been on what you recreate mainstream media was fine with that kind of think they're carrying electric smallpox radically here almost ... years ago it took me forty years ago\nA day or night I I think okay I under your right by the way ... ... well let\nMe let me see okay so let me say there is there is overheated rhetoric but I Am completely opposed to letting their man\nAnd I believe that the greater threat to America frankly I think it's up to the best of my knowledge anyone who says that they're bringing in smallpox is making a stupid argument okay I agree with you I never heard it but I Believe you that it's being set I'm sure a lot of ... things are being said I operate of smallpox okay\nAll right you're right fine Okay Michael\nI I agree with you said you don't have to debate me any more if if that is one of the stupidest arguments against is the only arguments against this is not smallpox the only argument against this is just the does America have a border or not that it could control the left essentially believes and open borders cause it finds nationalism to beat the testable\nThey find it to test the but when we were asked to pull in the United states\n... you know it and you know\nWait it's a way where nationalism is not having that nationalism is having nationalism is having borders borders as part of being ...\nMuch much more than that and you know there\nWas one of the much more that's where we may differ I don't think it's more than that I don't think that\nYeah it is your height for protection other quarter thing that not only should we protect the border but the people who want to cross that border are ... they carry your other alien\nOkay are we going back to that al ... single right word I'm OK from the credits now\nOkay that's a lecture we talk to you when he called animals who was MS Thirteen image Thirteen our animals if you don't believe the Amish Thirteen can be characterized as animals\nI don't know who would be okay I think the ... so the debate is about the debate is not over verbiage even though verbiage matters I agree the debate is over whether the United states of America like any country can have a have a a a border\nI can protect its borders the way Michael protects his home in San Francisco and the way I protect my home in Los Angeles\nIf America is our home we have a right to say who can come in that's pretty

Murray brighter we've published my Bible coming from a beautiful job I might add the brighter we've published by bubble coming from a beautiful job I might add [noise] so I have a question for you\nAs I could use some full time through some so I'd like you to call and we're told repeatedly today that bore a Jew hatred in and talk with Jews are about president\nOr if you're a Jew or you're experiencing a anti Semitism at work or on your dry from home or or anywhere else I I have not even my mail and ... I'm I'm pretty well known you in the United states and\nWhere to touch them in the mail I mean there are others who do I have a saying that they don't I don't deny for a moment but I get very very little old am I ever I've not seen any increase the people who hate me hate me because I'm a conservative but because I'm a Jew\nSo I uh I'm I'm just curious I really am curious maybe I Am not aware of this increase that is allegedly and maybe factory\nTaking place I Know what you're taking place on college campuses bet that but that's all from the left and from Islamic students that's not that's not from the right but that is true if one wants to identify\nA anti Semitism and it's increasing you say well that's anti Israel yet but there there was very little difference okay if the only state on earth you target is the only Jewish state on earth than I'm Sorry but that is anti Semitic okay let's please save me take me the uh the nonsense\nThere are two hundred and something countries but the only one that I work to it destroys the Jewish state but I don't dislike Jews oh okay so you don't dislike Jews it doesn't matter [laughter] and I said but does it does it mean dislike Jews means work work to when I elite then how's that\nShow yes there has been I there is an increase on anti Semitism on the American campus but that's not what the people who say there's makers anti Semitism talking about they they think there's an they claim is an anti Semitism that is massively increased from the right\nWhereas on the campus it's from the left and from um ... many Muslim students 'cause it's it's target specifically Israel there were students who were afraid to wear a Jewish star there are there are students who were afraid to where you know I'm a college campus but other than that do you believe that this is in on the increase\nAnd what is your take on this uh this whole issue\nOne aide Prager seven seven six is the ultimate issues our eight seven seven you know watch on it's been too long I needed I crave it give us the eight seven seven jingle\nOur eyes very nice job right out okay that's good okay very good show I'm joined by the way of showing you should know\nSang that compose that and played it on every one of the instruments [noise] marketable a cheap and it's okay he didn't mark spring Texas hello mark Dennis prayer\nI honor mark hot I think there isn't a Nike and\nThere is an increase in ten minutes President Obama almost a hundred percent right [noise] um Iran now\nIraq well I don't do it all and those things and how they train and actually in the platform at the credit card so that they feel that any minute okay the entire oriented\nAnd I personally had um we had our mind around at our guy\nCan out by someone who is all over it and we had it ... all the playground [noise]\nUm when did that happen\nIt happened and then all the Obama years [noise]\nMhm [noise] All right let me react I I I just want to say okay this is an important I thank you for calling I don't agree I don't blame President Obama for an increase in anti Semitism and I don't blame the President Trump\nAnd I don't think that conservatives should play the cards that the left does even though it's tempting I don't think Obama increased the anti Semitism and I don't think that um that the President Trump has I Do think that President Obama increased racial tension in the country\nHe could he could have been of course of his eight years Reid reassured or\nBlack America that this is a really good country\nInstead he said that racism is in our DNA spoke about Ferguson even though it would be the white policemen was acquitted by largely black jury\nBut because he acted completely in self defense with Michael Brown was not an act of racism whatsoever for the president to say ...\nWas a disgrace to have a Al Sharpton visit him as often as he did El Al Sharpton was one of the instigators of the only ... an American history that word is a minute is used by Brandeis University historian\nIn describing the events in Brooklyn New York and crown heights when blacks attack Jews\nAre and ... they were ... by Al Sharpton\nAnd that so yes but I don't believe that President Obama's responsible for um for an increase in anti Semitism racial tension yes did he leave the country worse than he founded in every way possible I Believe so but but not in terms of anti Semitism okay\nLet's go to um [noise] uh Dustin in Columbus ohio Hi Dustin Dustin hold on I'm not going to I don't want to interrupt you hear the music so we'll take you [noise] so I we hear about all this increase in anti Semitism so if you're a Jew or amount and you tell me do you think that this is true [noise]\nOutside of the college campus I don't I don't I don't believe it is true but hey I don't live everywhere [noise]\nRight you're right there you're you're explaining it yeah yeah All right I I think you're you're explaining it uh and I think there is that that is part of it you should all I'll read the Israel test by George killed or who is of course not Jewish and or she has five minute video with ... university the Israel test and he uh he explains that point\nIn his unique eloquence with his unique eloquence that he is he's a ... one of the major thinkers among among one of the major ten fingers living\nSo he uh he he ... the resentment if you if you resent\nSuccess not just financial but also financial then that's part of what comprises anti Semitism but anti Semitism of course as I pointed out has the elimination missed element we will I liked him the guy in Pittsburgh settled Jews must die\nThat is very rare among ethnic bigotry is there a million ethnic bigger trees in the world this try this try this nation hates this nation is religion hate this religion cetera et cetera but the notion that every one of them most die that is essentially unique to July ...\nBasketball I was told that you wish babies must die\nSo it's a it's been um [noise]\n... it's a very serious hatred but again my my question is do you think it's increasing in the United states where do you think that that's a exaggerated I I it is increasing I'm a ... but it's increasing to my opinion on the left\nAware or anti Zionism has substitute for anti Semitism anti Zionism is a form of anti Semitism of folks if if you have any intellectual integrity you look knowledge that\nI should say that the only state in the world the only people on earth to have no rights will country all the Jews is anti Semitic okay if you if you think Italians don't ever write to Italy then you're anti Italian even if you love pizza and you love a Vivaldi and you\nLove a a a battalion opera\nYou know ... and ... it's irrelevant okay even if you if you've if you've got to a polio vaccine you could still be a semi by the way these people to give you an idea of irrationality old Jews must die so full Jews must I how do you believe this guy might have had polio\nIt was a Jew developed that'd be of the polio vaccine in so many other medicines\nAll Jews must start but I still like to benefit from all of their medical uh discoveries [laughter]\n[noise] but that list of it it's not like\nThe these guys think rationally anyway if you read about this guy in Pittsburgh using total loser eat eat eat eat even the New York times which is of course blaming Trump or even
