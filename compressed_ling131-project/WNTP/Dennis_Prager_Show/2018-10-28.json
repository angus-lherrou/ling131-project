S. P. patient and we're getting some improvement both in our eyes height eyesight\nAnd the fact that she's getting some feeling back\nIn terms of her studying is now I attribute that to what else we use in addition to the stem cells so we don't just deliver the stem cells and say hey go off on your own were actually looking at giving you the growth factors that you need to help the stem cell set the nutrition that's needed for the stem cells a et cetera\nWe also use something the ivy stem cells for lung condition and we had an improvement on a patient with COPD of a we actually improved his I'm permanently function by test so there are many reasons to use stem cells and there are many modalities ups themselves are not all like\nIn what conditions do you look at stem cells that will most likely\nCertainly for the pain in terms of the joint pain people loved the a plate ... rich plasma\nAnd that's done injectable into your knees into your small joints into the ankle and we've used it on the fingers we actually had a young man come in\nWho actually sliced his finger a top part of his finger off they reached so the finger but he wasn't getting feeling in it he was a mechanic he needed that small motor skills he came to us got the stem cells and actually called me just a little while ago and told me\nYou know what they're coming back and it does take several months for this to happen so it isn't it overnight thing\nAnd we do believe that you need to do some other hydration in addition to this in order to make sure that the stem cells do the job that God created\nThem before I was just going to ask you that you deliver the stem cells yes we have a protocol and you have a political but you also include designers ratio\nAnd specific hydration and some a neutral suit of clothes a including homeopathic that will indeed help the stem cells do the job\nDo you do it and I've seen a lot of ads for\nKnees yeah yeah we did we definitely do need he'll get definitely do nice there and we're soon to be doing larger joints as well because we're believers that you use some other technology with that 'cause you want to make sure you're getting the stem cells where they need today\nIs that better than just an an e replacement is\nNot going to say listen I mean I don't mean they weren't the project their upcoming scout me no but you know look if you needed knee replacement you need a neighbor's but I'll tell you this if you can get away with using the stem cells for example more physical therapist is a good example of that\nShe's been doing P. R. P. right now rather than doing the knee replacement she wants to hold the knee replacement offer as long as you get\nSo this this will can help this would be aware of how to try to run out of the progression of the conditions are and this is what we're all about we're not going to cure John\nOkay and and I know you talk about neuro degenerative diseases\nThat he has the case is just unbelievable and and how is she doing by doing great share her eyesight has improved extensively and now she's actually having feeling before she falls backwards it's part of the condition and now she knows when it's coming and she doesn't get up out of the chair which is great\nAnd the we mentioned knees and we mentioned nor degenerative is there any other lawyers long young\nAlone and I I'm really I and I think you're going to see it working well with congestive heart failure to\nSo this is like well what we say twenty second century medic medicine but this is really becoming more and more prevalent right ed seems like more and more conditions you you're able\nTo use it for a while we're trying to use it on a lot of things and again we're using it in conjunction with traditional medication in conjunction with a sub clinical doses of some things and hydration very important because it allows the nutrients for this themselves\nWhat's the difference in stem cells being delivered an innovative medical associates as opposed to maybe someplace else 'cause he might have said\nOne of the reasons that we believe is different is we're going to put a whole political together for you that includes a hydration to make these stem cells for the lack of a better word utilize them so that we can actually continue to monitor your Prague\nBut we really want to get you in a situation where these stem cells are working whether it's with the physical therapy or with Dr ... and myself in terms of the hydration we're seeing Dr more for some additional work\nNow you mentioned that the stem cells is a slow and steady progression white ... a couple of months a couple of months yeah okay you'll see some change especially with the joins the overall though a couple of months to see some progress and I'll tell you a New England\nBut he take the ... we're seeing steady progress right along now the ebbing tide of it but again it's about reaching this therapeutic level you can wait for a stem cell shot that\nMight not be your therapeutic level you might need to so the question is exactly what all natural substances all new mayor dally we got to get to that therapeutic level\nAnd and that's pretty much what would you do absolutely as Lulu and everything is customized another way for the person is not getting the same as another\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight to one

eight to one nine I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight two three eight to one nine\nIf you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael Pincus on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress and how your kill max formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nWhile we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart won't beat boot very important factor in life\nYou would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's Bastille Perot's is going to list just goes on and on and on\nAnd then this this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the bunny\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too\nSo it's nothing that really mess around with that what happens is that we need that many of them in your body in order for the cow seemed to be absorbed\nThough so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body needs to actually feel the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nThough the other thing that is really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and that case studies of people actually take into account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches\nThere's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older ... they're linked there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well and\nSo they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting goal in life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest at\nWell all due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and is and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because get set up powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and

R. E. E. offer I said free offered today from purity products no strings attached\nThis is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business\nFor years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key is visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's\nIn our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body but more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby ha it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on\nAll of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they they certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make\nMore ha now women have more ha to lose the men do\nAnd you see this skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course parity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints so people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age\nAnd so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers are going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint\nYou could see the actual pictures for yourself\nBut the ha revolution has come here pet and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real well\nIt's real for Tom the rights to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California\nSeventy years of age participating in the whole why Iron Man contest and Kona, Hawaii this past year\nSeventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joint did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball but the twenty year old\nAnd I've even begun to jog again these are the kind of report that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one out of that is pretty popular MSN how does this age a stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take 'em for a while before you even see any results you\nGlued costs may take quite a while to kick in\nMSN is a wonderful sulfur compound and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful but they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced it\nThat's what we call youthful that's that's what we had when we were young here's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support\nHis lower back and of course he said I Can't believe that now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product people have tried all the alternatives they've searched everywhere else pat and they haven't heard of ...\nAnd now the reorder rates on AJ sort of tell me that things are phenomenal the product works and study shows how but what are the customer saying what are they telling you candidly what are they saying the bill Saudi\nIt's amazing to me how people say just keep sending death it's wonderful it changed my life here is Lorraine saying I Can't believe it but I'm able to run I Love it\nHere's Brent writing says no one at parity products made an outlandish claim

then ginger didn't put\nQuite as much ginger as I did last week but a ... a little bit more ... Egypt with three different stages\nAnd honey you know on the ... you probably didn't have to do it but are stripped believes in the flowers off to them on the ... oh it also has a a time or the English time and only English time even though\nThe leaves are very small ... saw normally hold it by the tip and strip all the uh small leaves off the using the honey it leaves the ones on the tip and you can break them all from the stem\nOr the tip is there's not worthy ah so ah so could go in there is nothing dangerous around the stands or anything but the woody stems on your Herb's will give more tanning in and out or you know a different flavor to the to the the stage has real solved\nA succulent stamps so just crush them a totally throw 'em in there\nAnd the ginger I\nI normally field the peeling off the ginger and then and then cut it with the grain not across the grains a lot easier to cook for one thing that I think\n... to ... you know if you cut it up into pretty thin slices or very thin slices you're going to get more the flavor out with a using less ginger so that's a good way to go\nOh you probably don't need to do that if you grow your own you know that you're the only one that has handled it and it's\nYou know from a clean organic garden you probably don't need that but in the grocery store you know there are there a\nA laying out there and everybody can pick 'em up and examine them and some people will break pieces and you know who's been handling them so it's a good idea to clean was one of the uh uh products you know a bottle washer\nVeggie wash or

of people of the\nRoute of the country um than other countries taking it and have fun with that we usually do one a subject to Tom the one subject of the current one is drainage but we covered a lot of stuff\nOne of the most important things that I started doing ... years ago when I was primarily in the landscape design business was\nDraining areas that need to have something done more positive to them with a underground a drainage system and I came up with this idea of instead of putting a pipe in the ground and grab all round the pipe and then fill in the ditch back up with some oil\nA started filling the entire ditch a was travel all the way to the surface of the ... or even in turf because\nYou know you get a little bit of oil spilled out on it and the ... spread out over the gravel anyway and you set up a situation\nThat way where the entire linked to the ditch the drainage ditch functions as an inland\nAnd it works beautifully and you don't even have to go to the expense of putting a pipe in the bottom some people still can in fact we mentioned that it's okay to do it but I'm remembering that if you have a blow area that you're trying to drain around at a tree or just a Los bought\nTaking that line out to a lower point just folded up gravel to the surface will probably solve the problem\nThe other really interesting thing that we came up with a long time ago that was has been used a lot is to a level out a real bumpy turf area not by\nBringing new material or I don't recommend ... or anything like that hardly ever or in some people say it's good to use composting compost would be the second best thing to do so in the ...\nWatch better just run a core error writer or across the entire turf area and core air raid heavily then what you do is when those scores are laying around all over after the work has been done you simply rake the corps into the low spots\nAnd that gives a cut in Phil effect to the lawn and we'll end up leveling off without
