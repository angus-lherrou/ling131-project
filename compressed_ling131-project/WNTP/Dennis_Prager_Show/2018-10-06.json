be sure there's no raging infection left in the mouth like a dead to or a pocket of infection from an old extraction something like this\nSo we need to hunt that down and make sure we got rid of that then we've got to work on getting the first morning you're in ph into screens don't know if you were five years old this would be usually a very easy task John\nBut when I have five so neither you

work so I don't do work\nSimple as that tracked you should see my column this week it is a it was explaining the left\nAnd its contempt for\nThe middle class bourgeois Judeo Christian values system and that explains\nTheir belief that they are that normal moral rules do not government that is why they can shout down people at a restaurant conservatives do not because they believe there are rules that govern them\nThat's why they can close bridges because they don't believe rules govern them this is an extremely important thing\nThe smearing of judge Kavanaugh ... an unprecedented unprecedented smear up a good man I I we are in fact Alan Dershowitz calls it worse than McCarthyism man has been a is a lifelong Democrat because he's a liberal\nAnd he does subscribed to the to the moral norms of of the upper middle class norms as we call them but the left is not\nThe normal rules of civility do not God you'd go left\nThey are ... mention am I right that word they are ... ... ... is the Superman literally over men they are over the rest of us over the deplorable deplorable believe in middle class Judeo Christian values less ... left wing or do not\nThey are governed by what they feel is necessary to achieve their ends they break eggs to make a left wing omelets and that is what we are seeing a happening I mean we I I got on to that because I was explaining\nI Do feel governed by rules\nSee you can yell and that's why I've said also often you can yell at conservatives for being hypocrites because they have a standard\nBut you can who who was a yelled at left wing hypocrisy there's no such thing as left wing hypocrisy because there were no rules that govern them so you can't be a hypocrite if you don't promote that rules\n\n... by the way another another

ice in a guy's face fall in college\nSo what so what\n[laughter]\nThe reason that left this don't have any problem with doing this\nIs they are ... they are they believe that getting rid of his nomination before the elections is a good that overwhelms moral norms you can destroy a man and his family a good man and his family\nBecause over rioting that\nIs the good of not allowing for the first time in the lives of just about any American conservatives to have a majority on the Supreme Court\n\nI Can't speak for before Nineteen sixty two but I can tell you about a Nineteen sixty two it was already covering by the left because they ruled the prayer in school is unconstitutional as idiotic as a whole series of ... as as an judicial forget idiotic\nAs not based on the constitution but based on what people left of center think is right that's all that matters the constitution doesn't matter the Bible doesn't matter to a leftist their feelings are their moral guides\nThat's what you

hence\n\nThe ultimate issues hours devoted to the belief that having a map is useless unless you know where you're going\nYou know exactly where you are but if you don't know where you're going it's useless so why does it all about what are the big issue that's why it's the ultimate issues that are after all so sometimes something in the news provokes a subject\nOn the male female our or for that matter the happiness our or for that matter the ultimate issues that are not as the\nCase today so\nI guess it's ... it's a multi faceted question but it revolves around one issue and that\nIs if you are middle aged adults\nIs it important in assessing you how you acted in high school it's obviously based on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and that's the question you're how old is he exactly fifty four fifty three fifty four or whatever you're so you're in you're almost mid fifties\n\nIf you let ... let me put it this way if you had an important position in Europe business where your school and you had your ... agreement\nThat man had led a remarkably good life as an adult the little words from the age of Twenty one so for thirty five thirty four years whatever has been a remarkable human being contributed to his community a family man\nAs a churchgoer which to me means something to many it doesn't ... would you then what do you pursue allegations of misconduct in high school\nThat's the question I wouldn't if I were hiring for Prager you and I and\nI'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old the where the proximity to high school is a few years I'm Talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody applies for a job at ... university\nIs unanimous wanna find human being family man community man this person has been and then uh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same chargers\nOkay I Would ignore them\nAnd it's clear what type of adult you would have been I Am I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school so that's the question that's the it's a ... how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\nNot not not a thirty about twenty five but in high school\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow I don't have I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy and high school and I let an anti cheating on tests campaign I was elected the graduating class president I I was a bird was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that you know things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think it's a possibility or in the case of Brett Kavanaugh but happen or not happen if\nThey ... they were kids in in high school who were uh near two wells and who ended up fantastic adults\nSo ... who cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act and high school ... active in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five\nThat's a separate issue you because you you want to form a good person as early as possible I I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nWhat how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position that you think do you think it matters that's the question\nWhy Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nStuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business Qunu what a terrific person this is and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you uh you you Rob the candy store All right that's pretty serious not not not simply\n... not simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner and and you rub it\nBut it is obvious you turn July for rent or otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we won't let no point to acknowledge\nThat your turn your life around that's far religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity so rooted in the importance of benefits of forgiveness\nOf tissue vi and in the Hebrew of of return or that's ...\n\nThat is this famous Hebrew statement that I'm a I'm a ... literally translating from the Hebrew where a panic stands the most righteous person cannot stand\nYour a higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turned that life around them has been good the whole time\n\nThat's how that's how I Am and of course obviously impulse religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people sins and forgiveness\nAnd the uh Judaism holiest day is the day of of uh of panic since day of atonement Yom ... so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo uh I emphatically endorsed the notion that when you are already in middle age and the blood a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd bribery where where's your color cutting off line is el is elementary school right well you know elementary school well yeah that's what people said until recently about high school\nOne a Prager seven seven six\n\nAnd let's go to will in San Antonio hello will Dennis Prager\nI gotta I [noise] [noise] well yes\nI could just tell you a little back story um I was a through high school through college uh we did go live in

know that that they lie in the media\nPrincess shattering thing isn't it it it doesn't matter how you've led a whole adult life that's what's being out at in the United states of America\nAnd I worked at a school and I would hope that people jak just with the young kids I was like these these kids are going to be good you know quick yeah thing I'm just be a good parent and do the best they can and you know put God in there and you got it\nRight I think it usually does thank you I contend that for many years that my mother couldn't believe I didn't end up in prison [laughter]\n... you have no
