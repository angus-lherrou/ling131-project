things sound really good to me when you wake up in the morning in bed or the feet and hands still cold\nYes\nThey are okay All right then let's go to circulation\nSo circulation the number one thing you would try at first just to see if it's an issue is you can go on something called circular gold\nThis promotes micro circulation throughout the body\nAnd it's your body weight I Would just go to for premium and just see it live in two or three days you have a difference for your hands and feet if you do then I'm going to recommend that you go on the battlefield diet\nAnd use strictly follow it so there's no oil nothing that says occasional rarely you don't eat any of those things for at least thirty days\nAnd see if it now promotes a better circulation to their hands and feet if it does then it's the food that's doing this to you and it sounds like that's the case 'cause it sounds like you've got all the all the things the adrenal is need you could try\nMax stress me and see if it does any good for you maybe one or two teaspoons per day and just see if that benefits you at all and when you wake up from sleep you feel rested\nYes sir I go\nOkay well if that's true then all the adrenal things except maybe the B vitamins\nShould be good in ... that would rule out the ... in my mind so [noise] um get a copy of the battlefield diet what I Would do is just be very strict for

feet in jars they found all of this\n... awful things but you know what's really awful and I just add to that but it's worth knowing the night of the raid when the eventually caught up with this guy only because it's a fantastic a police detective Kim would play very brilliantly innocent by thinking\nThat nice they all they are the da da da da da and two nurses from the department of health\nI Wonder if you go when you walk into this you got all these women lined up for abortions kept walking around the smell of death their bodies lined up in the in the basement and guess what these two
