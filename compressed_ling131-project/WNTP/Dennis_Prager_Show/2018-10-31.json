accusation they make a backup with data so I offer you plenty of data\nAnd in this case nearly all of them have relied on a totally fraudulent study a from a group that is supposed to help Jews and is hurting members call the Anti Defamation league\nAnd as a Jew I Am embarrassed and saddened by the fact that they have become a Jewish ACLU just another left wing organizations lying but because they hate Trump\nFor me to say the ACL's lying is a very big charge I mean they can really unleash a lot of charges against me for doing that so I I think one of us is okay so I really I'm putting my reputation on the line my credibility\nOne of us is not telling you the truth either the ACL as lying to you or I'm lying to you about the ideal really gets pretty simple\nWe can't both be right my

eight states October thirty first\nTeam makes quite a number of powerful points are you ready\n[noise] first just for people to understand Pittsburgh was I'm reading from Pittsburgh was hardly the first time an anti Semitic gunman murdered people\nIn a Jewish institution in the United states\nBetween the Clinton and Bush two years\nThere was a shooting at a Jewish community center in LA shooting at an El Al ... Los Angeles international airport a shooting at the Jewish Federation Seattle a shooting at a Jewish community center a Kansas City in a shooting at the Holocaust museum\nLower levels of vandalism and violence have been even more common it's true the death toll in Pittsburgh was especially high but that's just happenstance any of the other shooters would have been happy to kill as many or more\nSecond the Trump Administration includes some very strong opponents of anti Semitism UN ambassador Nikki Haley is for the anti Semitism in the world body\nOne of the world's primary purveyor of it with a vigorous ineffectiveness not seen at least since Daniel Patrick Moynihan Trump appointee Ken Marcus head of the department of education's office of civil rights has devoted much of his career to fighting anti Semitism\nThose who wish to blame Trump have an ace in the whole\nAn Anti Defamation league study that purports to show I'm almost sixty percent increase in anti Semitic incidents between twenty sixteen twenty seven team which is implicitly blamed on Trump this study has been cited over and over in response to ... to Pittsburgh\nThere were several problems with relying on this study for Trump bashing however the first is that the study includes one hundred and Ninety three incidents of bomb threats to Jewish institutions as anti Semitic incidents even though by the time the HDL published the study it had been conclusively shown\nThat the two perpetrators of the bomb threats were not motivated by anti Semitism\nI'll tell you and I told you this many times about Ninety percent of those bomb threat to the Jewish community centers were cold than buying American Jewish kid with mental problems living in Israel the other ... percent were black radical\n... and you have to be a deal as he writes one can only guess why the ... chose to inflate it statistics in this way\nBut none of the explanations speak well of the ideal second ... port itself acknowledges that some of the rising incidents may simply be due to better reporting quote more people are reporting incidents to a deal than ever before unquote third quote\nCollege campuses so a total of two hundred and four incidents in twenty Seventeen compared to one hundred and eight and twenty six team unquote\nHe continues to right professor Bernstein how many of those incidents emanating from traditional forms of anti Semitism cut one might associate with Trump being populism and how many from leftist pro Palestinian sources the a deal doesn't say\n\nDo ... I Hope you you're following this point it's rather important oh look at all this increase of anti Semitism on the Trump and then cited doubling of incidents of anti Semitism on college campuses Ninety nine percent of which I probably induced by the left at by Muslim students\n\nFor the ... big you was incidents as anti Semitic\nSo long as they were reporters such for example the report states quote Jewish graves or cemeteries were desecrated seven times in twenty Seventeen\nThe desecration of Jewish headstones is a classic anti Semitic act employed for hundreds of years the majority of the cemetery desecration occurred in the first months of the year at the same time as the bomb threats were called them to Jewish institutions\nContribute to a sense that the Jewish American community was under siege unquote after say a Jew American Jew or have not felt under siege but\nYou know hey I'm a conservative so I think differently which is true I Do I think differently is correct cult clearly the problem is the desecration of cemeteries of all faiths is not uncommon\nAnd are often the product of either bored teenagers or vigorous in fact at least some of the cemetery incidents counted by the the L were ultimately determined by police not to be anti Semitic in origin\nThe desecration of a cemetery in St Louis got a particularly large amount of attention the police eventually caught the perpetrator and determined that he was just mad and drunk not anti Semitic\n... not updated its study or press release to relate to reflect such facts\nOther questionable quote anti Semitic unquote incidents I've seen reported include graffiti with the swastika\nAnd Trump in quotes is the author supporting Trump the Nazi or attacking Trump accusing him of being a Nazi\nMy inclination would in most cases the suspect the latter but surely it's at least unclear none of which is to say that we can move out of the surge but the ... study every one relying on to prove this doesn't show any such thing [noise]\nI'll continue fraudulent bay deal report on anti Semitism the whole left wing media\nLike the Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank\nAre relying on turns out to be a fraud [noise]\nThose are big words I Know what I'm saying one eight Prager seven seven sit\nThe amount of hate from the left towards the amount of heat from the right ... there's no comparison the problem is that no sound appear recalled data exist that shows an increase in anti Semitism during the Trump Administration how do you like that\nThat would justify such claims while the data that does exist like much Saturday the study proves no such thing\nUndoubtedly many readers are silently protesting what about the ACL statistics showing a fifty seven percent increase it anti Semitic incidents and twenty seven team a finger reported by NPR the New York times the Washington Post and many other media outlets in ...\nThat's not what this study shows wait a minute you meet NPR the New York times Washington Post a line no professor Bernstein that's not possible not it's not possible they wouldn't lie\nIn fact I saw what the study shows and despite the way it's been reported in the HBO's own press release the actual findings don't even purports to show any such thing\nMost important this study is not actually claimed to count anti Semitic incidences such but rather the reporting of these events first it purports to count those incidents that have been reported to the ... by the media law enforcement in the public\nThe HDL or knowledge is that some of the increase in documented incidence is not an actual increase but results from Cold War people reporting incidents to a deal than ever before second\nThe report does not count only actual anti Semitic incidents but any incident that results quote in Jews perceiving themselves as being victimized due to their Jewish identity unquote\nAs a result of this methodological pick the aid deals tally includes a hundred and sixty three bomb threats made the Jewish community center on the Jewish and students early twenties Seventeen even the two perpetrators were not motivated by anti Semitism\nRelated Lee twenty Seventeen so don't usually high level of concern and the Jewish community over perceived threat a result of both Trump's victory and the Jaycee see called Jewish community center\nThis likely lead to an increase in ambiguous incidence being reported to the ab yells anti Semitic we know for example that one purported example of anti Semitic cemetery vandalism turned out to be just old stones toppling over from poor upkeep\nDa da da da da da da and another turn out to be the product of a drunken mad I read this to you from the other article he wrote individual with no anti Semitic content ... did not delete that one from a tally\nThen of course it's the campuses right which is overwhelmingly from the west is even more dramatic refutation of the gay deal study then I Will take your calls\nIs a big deal I'm Dennis Dennis ... from the relief effort and your brain freeze to now [noise]\nNine Ninety intelligent conservative talk\n[noise] with us\nOr I knew who was eyeball I knew in
