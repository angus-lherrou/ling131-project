M. D. be dead gum [noise]\nSays you can't do work so I don't do work\n... you should see my column this week it is a is explaining the left\nAnd its contempt for the middle class bourgeois Judeo Christian values system and that explains\nTheir belief that they are that normal moral rules do not government that is why they can shout down people at a restaurant conservatives do not because they believe there are rules that govern them\nThat's why they can close bridges because they don't believe rules govern that this is an extremely important thing\nThe smearing of judge Kavanaugh on an unprecedented unprecedented smear up a good man I I we are in fact Alan Dershowitz calls it worse than McCarthyism man has been a is a lifelong Democrat because he's a liberal\nAnd he does subscribed to the to the moral norms of of the upper middle class norms as we call them but the left is not\nThe normal rules of civility do not God ... the left\nThey are ... mention am I right that word they are ... ... ... is the Superman literally over man\nThey are over the rest of us over the deplorable deplorable believe in middle class Judeo Christian values left ... left wing or do not they are\nBy what they feel is necessary to achieve their ends they break eggs to make a left wing omelets and that is what we are seeing a happening I mean we I I got on to that because I was explaining I Do feel governed by rules\nSee you can yell at you and that's why I've said also often you can yell at conservatives for being hypocrites because they have a standard\nBut you can who who was a yelled at left wing hypocrisy there's no such thing as left wing hypocrisy because there were no rules that govern them so you can't be a hypocrite if you don't promote that rules\n\n... by the way another another matter in this regard my original column that this ... this charge should have been ignored it was right on my mind was the only one to the best of my knowledge riding on this in the national media\n\nOr they may have been others I I I I certainly hope there were actually my point is not to tell you that on great my point is to tell you that I was alone are largely alone\n\nI said from the beginning a man who has an impeccable life as an adult\nI Am not interested in what he did in high school I Would have held this for Merrick Garland had he been the nominee I Would hope because we are governed by rules and these rules apply to both Democrats and Republicans\n\nThis is this the new standard for the latest charge a New York times piece that he threw ice ... and a guy's face in a bar through ice in the guy's face fall in college\nSo what so what [laughter]\nThe reason that left this don't have any problem with doing this\nIs they are ... they are they believe that getting rid of his nomination before the elections is a good that overwhelms moral norms you can destroy a man and his family a good man and his family\nBecause overriding that\nIs the good of not allowing for the first time in the lives of just about any American conservatives to have a majority on the Supreme Court\n\nI Can't speak for before Nineteen sixty two but I can tell you about a Nineteen sixty two it was already governed by the left because they ruled the prayer in school is unconstitutional as idiotic as the whole series of ... as as an judicial forget idiotic\nAs not based on the constitution but based on what people left of center think is right that's all that matters the constitution doesn't matter the Bible doesn't matter to a leftist their feelings are their moral guides\nThat's what you must understand it is a this I have said much of my life it is the heart versus the law the moral law the heart follow your heart\n\nJeff in Stockton, California wants to know well I'll let him say that I actually don't take calls us early but it's a good challenge Hi Jeff Stockton, California Hi\nYeah next year 'cause I don't want to work in that you're saying that when you're\nWhen you're all our kids are going around her ... year old a twenty pound no room for her and then go on the on should not into that is correct okay it's very much\nAnd You're welcome okay of course that's what I said and I can\nOnly say that I Hope somebody charges Jeff from his high school days and then we'll see what his position as\nThere was not a shred of evidence to support if there was just dirt\nI wrote many years ago the rape of her name is also a rape I should republic shit I have to say I don't know if it's on the Internet I wrote it when I was writing a newsletter I have to check\n\nSee I'm guided eye as as many of you know I'm clouded by my religion Judaism in Judaism who is she who humiliates another person in public is considered to have murdered him it was such a powerful thing that is why I ... my show this way I never allowed Monica Lewinsky jokes for example I explained\nIt is it's up it's up the rape of a name is also right from ... when was it originally published does it have an original date on it and it was earlier from two thousand seven that that's so that's I just I simply rewrote it I guess on the vet named that's fine anyway it doesn't matter true was true eleven years doesn't change\n[noise]\nTime governed by that belief that to to smear or people humiliate them publicly is equivalent to a ... shutting their blood a basic Jewish aphorism and teaching\nAnd I banned all Monica Lewinsky jokes at I sat on the radio I Will hang up on you if you start telling me one I never told one\nI felt the woman was profoundly humiliated jokes were made of her\nHow do you make jokes of people at their expense it's it's just a I mean obviously there are jokes their political jokes that's fine I don't even mind ethnic jokes if they if they don't cross lines like I think any joke about [noise]\nAbout lynching could possibly be funny no joke about the Holocaust could possibly be funny but I I I haven't you and I tell the jokes about Jews\nThey it we have to laugh at ourselves and be able to laugh at others ... songs is not maliciously intended\nBut but humiliating they they specialize in this tear the man them tear the man that\nThe charges made thirty six years later about what a guy did in high school that is correct um unless there is evidence that he murdered somebody or or in committed an actual rate\nUh I I I because because of the ... of the crime that that's it otherwise I'm Sorry I'm Sorry we're not going to open up the gates to having this done\n\nSee what happens is the Democrats don't care because they want to win at the moment but it's like Harry Reid Harry Reid changed the rules on the Senate and with regard to the ability of the minority party in the Senate or to\nA delay of votes what does the word again by um when the last year by filibuster sell what happened is the the Republicans got into power and they all great what we need is a majority now will ... will apply that to the Supreme Court justices too\n\nSo I have to say uh it's painful but uh\n[noise] do I I I battled with is within me do I want women to come forward and do this to democratic nominees [noise] that this was done to me in high school the man is now fifty something years old [noise]\nI don't know I don't know because I Am so against smearing a name but they have to know what they have\nAnd you have a woman say what she said they're even know if you read the report of what is her name Michel ... Rachel yes Rachel and it's the last names ritual right Rachel Mitchell\nThe woman who seems to have asked you know ... very on challenging questions\n\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis what we should put it up and put it up at the finish Prager dot com\n[noise]\n\nI can only provide bunny assessment of Dr forwards allegations in a legal context and the legal context here as my bottom line a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove what this case is even weaker\nThan that this is from Rachel Mitchell a prosecutor of sex crimes\nDuck the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate them\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence than to understand the difference folks there there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt that is for a conviction\nBut outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard\nThat's different from beyond reasonable doubt just preponderance there but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\n[laughter]\nIt's a very dark day in America to very dark day because the ... there's an entire\nPortion of this country the left that does not believe in moral norms they acknowledge it ... ... if you put them if you do you believe in moral norms oh of course of course but tell them yeah where are they from their their from them their moral norms are left this moral norms\nWhy did they have such contempt for vice president Mike Pence\nMike Mike Pence announced he is not in his in his public career he has never sat in a room alone never dined alone with a woman other than his wife has always been another person man or woman president when he's been with the woman and they mocked him for that\nIn fact there were there are articles about how Pence would be worse than Trump\nBecause he he's a Christian he believes in Christianity\nThat's why they charge evangelicals with wanting to make a theocracy [noise] just telling people that are bound by biblical\nRules [noise] makes a theocracy [noise] within a Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio [noise]\n\nUsed to I'm nine Ninety am news jog nine Ninety died um um\n[noise] but that's our news I buy new in Washington even as the FBI rushes to complete his background check by friday the said it's up for a Republican Mitch McConnell is valley wants to go to the lawmakers will get a chance to vote up or down on the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation by\nThe end of the week three scientists from the U.S France and Canada had been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics that's where advances in laser physics three will be giving up a prize\nJust over one million dollars new ball shows about half of the young Americans expect to be financially better off than their parents have to sign the dream of upward mobility remains alive\nBut somewhat tempered the poll was done by the Associated Press dark set up Republican parents research and MTV it found about half of Fifteen to twenty six year olds think they will eventually be better off than their parents in terms of household finances\nAbout twenty nine percent expect to do as well as their parents twenty percent expect to be worse off more details and that's where a news dot com oh\nNice town nine Ninety whether ... pounds in San shower then it's going to happen\nIn Wyoming he made Ninety One shower and then it does in his evening on the lines of planning on tonight and I think he sang and send them our own way behind Seventy nine and importantly sending warming humid Thursday hiding very tightly sunny lower humidity on friday when I have a need for Saturday partly sunny nice to have any line\nLindsey Williams for news time nine nine AM based on nine Ninety dot com\nSecret ask all of your life your wealth insurance people an investment people today settling annuities or insurance contracts they're doing it around here so here's some strategies that can help you overcome the or at least\nWhen it comes to your money with getting clarity so if you're afraid of the stock market crash do the following some financial advice from secret us go every Saturday morning from tends\nTo let them pass your life your will fund stark nine Ninety nine and just talk about Ninety dot com\nI'm alert jobs ...
