Mr tripled tree at a certain point to those ceased to be in effect like seven feet\nSo I have a theory my dear friends that is going to blow your mind okay even the living martyr has not or\nHeard this new theory [noise] it's not entirely new wife made reference to this for decades but I have now put it in the context of the current political situation I Believe that we will be seeing more violence from the left\nAnd I would like to give you a theory as to why I I I mean my first theory I wrote up a few weeks ago in a very important column I know it's important because it got just on town hall or should we were twenty two thousand\nOr what does it again what do I forget that we're not forwards a when people pass on to them no no no come on guys [noise]\nShares yes I don't know why and it's I think of shares in terms of stocks I think that's the problem anyway I wrote the first reason I Believe that is that the left they'll like liberals again the left\nDo not believe that they are\nObligated to the to society's rules of of behavior facts Hillary Clinton said that just now did you see that we have we ever saying we have a clip by or any way if we do I would like to get it I Want and the Eric Holder that's exactly right\nWhen they're down ...\n... ... ... you know there are down so we take the high road they take the low road and when they're on the low road we kick them\nRight so there there are absolute invitations to violence and of course I mean I violence is a complex term in some ways is it violent to scream at people while they're having dinner at a restaurant\nFood interesting question if in other words if you're not touched is there is there ought to violence is the only sense that can be involved in violence the sense of touch a it's an it's an obvious question but anyway\nThe second reason this is my new\nIdea the second reason the left will be violent is this I'd like to read to you this actually is is a a\nSomething I cite in my Bible commentary in ... in chapter forty six of genesis about out yet coming up the spray anyway so let me tell you where it's from okay\nAge from three professors Roy Ballmer iced or who's been on my show with major criminologist bread Bushman and W. Keith Campbell in an\nArticle called self esteem narcissism and aggression\nDoes violence results from low self esteem or from threaten the ego wisdom\nWhat matters is self esteem ... that's the main with the peace if it was published\nFebruary two thousand in current directions and psychological science\n... it's the journal of the association of psychological science you are you a new one every couple of years you don't ... you would never let it collapse but impressive it is just impressive so why you wouldn't be everybody\nThe the article so these are all professors self\nEsteem narcissism and aggression from current directions in psychological science fruit from the year two thousand now I'm going to go to it until you are just a simple\nOne paragraph conclusion violent men\nSeem to have a strong sense of personal superiority\nYou hear that\nI told you this many times citing boy battle meister\nThat in his study of criminals which has his whole life work he found that that they had violent criminals had higher self esteem than the general population\nI continue favorable self regard is linked to violence in one's fear after another murderers rapists wife\nFeeders violent youth gangs aggressive nations and other categories of violent\nPeople are all marked by strongly held views of their own superiority when large groups of people differ in self esteem the group with the higher self esteem is\nGenerally the more violent one that is why the left will be violent and back to exactly right [noise] I a lot of time in various\nStrands that I have brought to your attention throughout my radio career\nIt is exceedingly important to understand the roots of the self esteem movement they are completely on the left John ... a left wing state senator in California I interviewed the man\nI understand where he came from why he pushed for it and California passed that I wrote against it what you could you take a look what the ear was California delegated\nUm I guess we have very high fell asleep and I always hot and found someone for greener yelling at me or not agree with me\nIf it's truly a lot I blame I wasn't really bother me I never thought of myself as I wrote an any way but I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem fell I guess\nI wanted a limit on it or you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids are on losing teams it's ridiculous\nOK so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be bored with mind one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child with God I couldn't agree with you more that's not the self esteem that the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God I promise you\nDo okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain ... that is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it [noise]\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd be you know okay you're even laughing ... that so that that proves my point so there's there at the other is you believe I Am I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in er into self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think a highly or or well of you are cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nOkay so I think we're on board on that the self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behaved irrespective of religion can sell us grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it\nThis is secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem I think there's a big difference I don't see evangelical Christians going out there\nAnd screaming at the at the legislature tours or pro

violence from the left\nThere it was called for by Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton this past weekend and just in time for me to find a direct quote\nPlane shorter than my commentary the rational Bible\nText volume coming out in may\nAnd it was apropos for certain arena seat\nTo think that you're right is not a problem I I don't know why you wouldn't think you're right if you have an opinion it's what you want to do with the people with whom you defer that distinguishes the right and the left we think we're right the left thinks they're right okay\n[noise] it's a tremendous amount of work and it's very rewarding was the rational Bible I'd like you to read the reviews on Amazon to see how it's touched people's what it's meant to to truly change your life for the better\n\nBy predicted another prediction I made that was accurate but I don't I make very few predictions\nAre predicted the facts that as a result of the covenant earrings\nWhich I was opposed to from the outset what am I stand by if\nI Do not believe that you should have been brought to Washington I Do not believe that the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee you should have listened to the testimony that's about to

hearing was ... people responded and the New York times because they they never come from non left thinking most New York times readers and perhaps the for those who can't stand the president\nMay start to understand that your choice is the president you can't stand the versus the people tearing down your society they show not even an issue it's not even a question but I predicted in mind that article I predict that\nIf we're going to go back to high school than we are going to go back to middle school and elementary school\nCould happen immediately incidentally I'd made another prediction for decades but if there was same sex marriage that will and for the left that will and then for much of society the belief that there was a distinction between the two sexes\nBecause the my my argument which was a it's a I don't believe it's ... can be refuted my argument was very simple and right\nBy saying it doesn't matter the sex of whom you marry you doesn't matter you're saying sex or gender doesn't matter and that's exactly what has happened and the generation of kids in a lot of parts of this country and the western world is being raised\nTo believe that they will choose whether they're a boy or a girl or men or a woman\n\nAnd some of my a mattress best friends people deeply in my life I'm ...

that in in light of how much typing\nPeople canal do on the computer and on their phones it's just not necessary to learn it it's like it's sort of an obscure art\nBut I I find that all that you can't

somebody like Trump one of the name it looked on people hurting like and I just wanted to get your take on that\nWell there there there is an answer to your challenge the number one I haven't seen him

general over at all or your wife though [laughter] it's an honor to be on your show I'm a I'm an avid listener daily listener you\nOffered stomach Claire when a cloud of chaos and the political conversation so it's an honor to be with you truly\nWell that's their arm jury touch because of who you are so thank you but I I Want to focus on you and your book and the news items that I just read about you and campus Owens but first let me tell everybody she was written this book campus battlefield\nHow conservatives can win the battle on campus and why it matters so campus battlefield the book is up with them as Prager dot com if anybody knows the campus battlefield is turning point you have people all over the country\nThat universities all over the country who are members of TPP will say I folks have spoken for his conventions all around the country or will be Newport Beach shooting in oh was it was just we can\nDo and I was in Florida for you and you know I just want people to know I spoke ... was Washington DC cause or a member of the the Donald Trump junior was with me a behind the scenes fair and a twenty five hundred students didn't feel\nThat that's correct yeah you spoke to our high school audience and you spoke to us on the Palm Beach and in fact you also a book at our chapter of the University of Wyoming or ... or the ... people selfish I was an excellent\nSpeech and I think our chapter at Colorado State\nUniversity is also hosting you know I in the near future as well so uh\nI just want people to know how much we worked together it's it's it's a powerful thing and that's the reason I mention that but I just want people understand twenty five hundred students from around the country use it a cheap and that's a very big deal and I I just want to salute you for that\nAnd it is when you go to something like that my dear listeners you you get some optimism\nShow you or your ... title of your book is\nHow conservatives can win the battle on campus All right go ahead how we are and why don't we wish him\nWell first of all the premise that I come forth in this book is one that you talk about a lot which is what we believe we're in in our civil war and that's our culture war for the soul of this country and politics of Andrew Breitbart used to say posed downstream from culture and the most in court vertical and culture is our universities\nUm they are they are filled with ...\nProfessor relief but as you always permanently said Dennis ... not very much wisdom that goes on there and what what I found by touring these campuses in speaking at you know over a hundred\nA year and now having an organization that spans Thirteen hundred of them across the country is that it's not that students are opposed the conservative ideas\nIf they're not exposed them at all the first place bravo and so and and the ... that are put together in this book or factually ... and it it it's in some ways increasing creeping ocean but we have to show up it's remarkable\nTo me how many students are searching for this message they have a desire to hear a different viewpoint and for whatever reason the universities have silent from and it's quite simple my conclusion I've come through as they hate the idea that there are other ideas\nA black not liberal very very few liberal out there where ...\n... they are focused on silencing any opinion that might ... model Rick Rick I'm control over the intellectual an ideological um viewpoint of a generation and so just just yesterday I spoke in South Florida we packed a room with eight hundred students\nDay before that we have two thousand students at the University of Georgia\nWait a minute wait whoa that's a big deal it really\nOr your weight you ... you wish you and campus or just you got\n... ... and myself pressures the real draw so I kind of just\nGo oh you're just humble guy okay I mean you're both ... but that that's very significant to south\nI forgive me I Want to underscore what you should be very briefly issue my dear dear listeners is they have never heard our side\nIt is not so much that they are from the left it is that they have no idea that there was a non molest way of approaching life\nExactly right and and what what I find for the work that pregnant university does and what we're doing on the ground is that when students are presented these arguments in a logical factor river\nUm non feeling sense if you will because every ... dogs is rooted in the ocean\nAnd it's rooted in Queens and as you've caught so many millions of people Dennis very few people care about how you feel we care about how you act and even more importantly what you think and why you think about what you do and so we have found is that\nStudents that have any sort of ambition students that have any sort of sense of human decency or wants to do something in their lives on there's no way they can find a ... ...\nBecause the left is all about tribal identity politics\nIt is about you can never you can never improve yourself you have to blame the external for any sort of suffering that you might be in your head being experiencing source students that might have what some would say classical liberal ears on gay marriage or abortion bare leaving the last\nIn record numbers because if they didn't believe him some stuff on the free enterprise\nOr they think that black only dormitories or a bad idea then all of a sudden they're considered to be a right winger are conservative at the at the university and so the second part that I highlight this book\nIs how radical the universities have become and it it is important for your listeners to understand the Democrat Party the sixties and seventies but JFK type Democrats those are considered to be fringe right wing radicals dial on college campuses if you believe that there are two genders you if you believe in free enterprise\nSystem if you believe America is the greatest country ever to exist those are considered fringe ideology and because of that you know the left has some ways during us a favor it allows us to recruit decent minded students that\nQuite frankly say there's no way I Want to believe in this cultural barks this world view that is being shut down my throat by my professors um and then the third point I make in the book which is really really important is how the conservative business community has subsidize the students are getting over the last couple of decades\nUm it is amazing to me you know you walk you walk the halls of Harvard or Yale or Princeton a majority of the big gifts that are given at these universities were the worst indoctrination occurs\nIs thanks to the giving of conservative successful business people that have allowed the Marxist to have unlimited amount of funds to indoctrinate\n... generation after generation and so it's really a call to action to parents and to a one night to stop giving money to the university not give it to ... university that the different things stop giving money your actual school you went to first\nOf all they don't need it second off they're going to use your money\nTo go against your values to a program a generation to hate America and that that really needs to be reinforced that I go through all this certain levels are given how universities corrupt the uh the ... process and how they deceived donors into thinking of going forward the targeted\nOn initiative or program when in reality it goes for opioid cultural studies or feminist studies and allows these professors to continue their um\nFor ... book the book folks again this campus battlefield Charlie Kirk founder and president of turning point usa the book is up a dentist Prager about kombucha please tell my audience what is happening with DePaul University\nYeah I mean DePaul University which is a private school in Chicago a Catholic school um has this allowed I did all set that candidate\nSelling myself are not allowed on ... next week despite the fact that we followed all their protocol that we feel about all the forms that they asked us to do and and they're not that they really and that's a common tactic of the lap Richard ... mayor and when you disagree with\nThat ... and Charlie Kirk on they express violent language that could be demeaning towards\nBy the way I Want you to know that that is another example of why I say the left law he's with the ease with which you breeze ... is that you wouldn't engage in violent language give the example she said she's black and she said black shouldn't vote Democrat and that is considered violent language\nThat that's correct in her so the ... the actor for the law\nThey learn that all they have to have seven or eight students feel they're threatened by a bigger and bigger than a couple of ... within a moment's notice and so the actor peppered occurring in by the professors and hope or important ... keeps going they are claiming\nTo be allowed to crack dialogue it allowed the agreement that allows you point to hurt bitter is a professor of none of that that big anger and they're really really good at it\nYou know hold on their whole cake Charlie Kirk my guess is the book campus battlefields I'm\nSchool movies every child ... ideas and go right when I was like I'm On that and I didn't\nReally only that there is only ... I write so there are only two ways and that is to to consider not sending your kid to a school and home schooling them a is a two and two and to provide a positive alternative\nAnd that is through the great books through the Bible through ... university videos me there's tremendous there was a tremendous amount of great stuff out there but the the first thing they\nEven ... yes of course like well you know one of the Bible has been infiltrated\n[laughter] that's that's the point\nPart of the reason I'm writing by my book which to my bought her or her shock came in ... the number one national bestseller non fiction number one number two in all book sold in America on Amazon when it came about may\nIf that doesn't show you a thirst for exactly uh what I'm trying to do are rational presentation in defense of the Bible and why it's the best book ever written nothing all I never imagined that it would be that successful\nThe Russia probe up\nBut uh they ... everything has been co-opted which is true he's right but we're we're fighting back that's why it's so important to the upcoming elections white so important that you vote if the Democrats do in the house they're not expected to win the Senate but if they don't win the house which you know the blue wave\nThat will be an enormous statement in this country they've tried everything the entire media has devoted two years\nTo undermining the Republican Senate seat of the presidency\nForget Donald Trump please give me a break you think if if my parents were president they would be any different hysteria of course not\nOf course not\nThey don't want an alternative they don't they the the giving up of power is not the left doesn't give up power as if they're not used to it\nThat's why they went crazy on Capitol that conservative court for the first time I would say since since Nineteen sixty forty fifty eight years the first time in fifty eight years the left doesn't control the court\nThis is this is intolerable New York times when we come back I Want to read to you or do your time's headline and sub headlined can give you an idea why the president calls it fake maybe\nWith Dennis Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studios\n[noise] nine Ninety intelligent conservative talk\n[noise] for that sort of new ... new in Washington Virginia's governor has declared a state of emergency in anticipation of hurricane\nMichael's residents passing the state governor Ralph Northam issuing the decorations day he's urging Virginians to prepare for possible flash flooding and been heavy rains also some strong winds tornadoes could crop up power outages could be the result\nOne of the charges against Harvey Weinstein was dropped to have heard evidence merge that a police detective had urged a witness to keep quiet about inconsistencies in the accusers accounts there was no immediate response from the New York police department when the details came out today\nThe Social Security is going to be giving more money to those who depended upon that starting next year the average recipient they say will be about thirty nine dollars richer every month about Seventy million Americans affected on Wall street the Dow Jones industrial average struggling again it's down two hundred and eighty one point this is as her a new\n\nAre you a stocker options trained her looking for real training strategies that you can use immediately Hi my name is Scott ...
