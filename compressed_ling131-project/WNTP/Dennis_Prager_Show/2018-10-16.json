high school I remember writing an essay on the moral necessity of the afterlife\nNot what most of my friends were thinking about on the other hand I Do want you to know folks I went to hockey games every week just I did I did leave a normal life semi normal\nAnyway the ultimate issues our I'm Dennis Prager and I have a truly a terrific guests man I have tremendous respect for Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture at the discovery Institute in Seattle\nI I Would you tell people I think it's important given that we are going to talk about science and face so tell people don't be humble about some of your credentials in the you're in that arena\nSure um I as you mentioned direct is a network of scientists or run out of the discovery Institute in Seattle\nUh my

about the origin of the first ... which uh prepare very abruptly in the fossil record in Contra diction to Darwin's own expectations of a very gradual origin for for animal life so your life has been\nImmersed in science by the way just I've never asked you this and all our time both privately and um or radio when public was what does the philosophy of science mean [noise]\nIt's the it's the discipline that addresses scientific questions that are right at the margin of science and philosophy things about\nThe nature and the basis of human knowledge the what's called in philosophy pissed about how we know what we know but also questions about a new consciousness the origin of the university origin of life\nUm [noise] and these are the ... that the topics that have always really fascinated me how did we get here how did life get here\nUm there's a huge scientific dimension to these questions but they also have encourage ugly philosophical implications and so\nI've always been attracted right at that boundary between the two and you have\nTo learn a lot of science to be any good in it and you have to be thinking philosophically to make any sense of a\nGreat combination did you enjoy your time ... really now if you have to do if you have to do something is grueling as a PHD it's nice to do it in some place like Cambridge or Oxford weather a lot of cultural compensations and wonderful people and the weather helps the weather's awful but I but I'm Seattle so I was\nAlready not late at night I never thought about\nHis latest book which he edited is a collection of essays\nAnd don't let the title of it in any way that you feel like evolution a scientific philosophical of logical critique number words they use the revolution is the attempt of many and a very good will people\nTo reconcile God and evolution and this is a series of essays critic critique critical of that position right up that position so let me get to that the book is up a dentist Prager dot com and obviously I mean if you interested in theology or science will find this immensely interesting\nSo I mentioned to your right before we went on the air that I until really I met you to be honest\nUh my my view was I didn't really care about evolution it didn't bother me if it was true and it didn't bother me if it wasn't true I Believe in God as the creator of the heavens in the earth the God of genesis one\nAnd if if God used evolution water why care it's all a miracle anyway so back in ... in a nutshell Ben I I read to you and talk to you\nAnd my wife frankly whose loans or a fair amount of his you know about evolution and and uh it has become less and less tenable not for religious reasons but for scientific reasons to\nAh to endorse the evolution as it is generally talk so before we get to a garden evolution\nI Know this is ridiculous in the time that I'm getting me give you a couple of minutes can summarize\nEvolution and why it's now I Wish they'd be skeptical about well not not only we would all be okay [noise] uh but but scientists right this is why you would have been my mind to scientists are having trouble with ... right right okay go ahead so quick\nThree definitions of the term evolution for orientation first is simply change over time nobody nobody challenges that there has been change over time or the kind of small scale variation we see in Galapagos finch beaks are peppered mobs or a bacteria that acquire ... antibiotic resistance is sometimes called micro evolution\nUm second definition of evolution is the idea of universal common descent and the idea that all organisms are connected by common ancestry back to one or very few simple forms such that the best picture of the history of life is like a giant branching tree as part of Darwin's argument the origin\nAnd the third in most controversial meaning of evolution is the idea that there's an ... guided on directed mechanism namely natural selection acting on random mutations that can produce all the new forms of life that emerged in the history of life the producers all the change over time\nAnd that that mechanism um ... is also responsible for the appearance of design that that ... biological systems manifested even leading evolutionary biologist acknowledge\nSo those are three key definitions the first is innocuous nobody doubts that the second is somewhat controversial the third is where do you stay a little much of that can on the tree I'm I'm skeptical about the the universal common descent there's a lot of continuity in the fossil record and then the genomic a patterns that we're now observing\nA but the key issue in the one that leading evolutionary biologist themselves are now questioning is the idea that the mutation selection mechanism has genuine creative power the ability to generate fundamentally new forms of life ah so what you hear a lot of evolutionary biologist quoting now an aphorism is that\nA mutation selection explains the survival but\nNot the arrival of the fittest explains a small scale variations but not the major innovations and in virtue of that uh two years ago this time um I was at a conference that of the royal society in Britain the oldest or\nIn arguably most August scientific body in the world they called a conference to a assess modern neo Darwinism and specifically to call for\nA an a new theory of evolution many of the evolutionary biologist there were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation that selection as creative power the opening talk at the conference by ... leading Austrian evolutionary biologist\nEnumerated several key what he called explanatory deficits of the modern version of Darwin's theory neo Darwinism\nBut a number of the the the deficits that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis bombing the the Royal Society\nWhat is the ... the royal society of London it was started by Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first president we yeah yeah\nJust reading about them yesterday okay so they that's incredible that you had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation where\nWhere most if not all of the talks were were exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement complement replace the standard mutation selection mechanism the odd thing about the conference however was that\nUh there was a group of of ah what they called themselves third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nA ... but they reject standard near Darwinism so they're looking for another approach they have their ... uh one group of scientists is known as the ultimate burger sixteen and one of the scientists who was involved in that who have called the conference declared at the end of this world society conference\nThat it was interesting but it was characterized by a lack of momentous miss\nIn other words they did a good job of critiquing the neo Darwinian mechanism but nothing really was offered to solve this problem because they rejected rejected out out of hand

evolution my guests Dr Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture the discovery Institute in Seattle now edited he is the evolution\nOur eyes and when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years\nWho have believed what you now say is not tenable what does that say if you are right why does that say about scientists\nThat science like uh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to groupthink or to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments in particular in\nDebate about biological origins there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle known as methodological naturalism and it says that if you're going to be a true scientist you have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanation for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates\nWhich would be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle then precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered that the foundation of life we've discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates till our local hero in ah in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program only much more complex than anything we've ever device but where does software come from it comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligence um\nActivity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that
