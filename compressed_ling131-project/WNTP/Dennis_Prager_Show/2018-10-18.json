I agree with it yeah so\nLet me talk to you about the water issue\nSo are you advocating a de ... process in in California part of it there's a book\nCalled there shall be water by such Segal which are out there you go out to write and\nI it outlines how Israel turned a desert and do a wonderful agricultural and by the way they Israel neither do it it was a national security issue for them that they could give their imports cut off any moment and they had to grow their own food\nLike I tell ya we need to be able to grow our own food in California as well I mean obviously we have imports are that are available now but if we get into a war or\nYou know California is ah the producer of most of the nuts and fruits and vegetables for the entire country and in many parts of the world to and you know that's a function of having water and we also need water to live in and take a bath\nAnd ... you have to you didn't have to add fruits and vegetables you just could have said was the producer of\nOf the mill [laughter] that would have been a double entendre I understand yes\nExactly by the way I I this is going to sound a little off to you but it's a ... I my listeners no I'm Serious the very fact that you would advocate do sell them as a nation would be reason enough to vote for you\nWhen when I think of what is being spent on the train to know where you had that we could be the salad leaving water we have as you pointed out the biggest body of water on earth the entire\nLength of this gigantic state cold California and I were told that we're ... we're going to have to the curb our behaving in showering and people will now transforming their lawns into rock garden and it's a it's a disgrace\nAnd it's also created almost a third world in the Central Valley I mean there are so many people in the Central Valley that depend\nUpon agriculture and water for their very livelihoods in living you know I mean the other people in Silicon valley God love them uh uh doing wonderfully but you look in the Central Valley in Victor Davis Hanson is written about this very well uh\nYeah it's almost a third world and some of those spots and uh they're being starved of water and I got to tell them I I've been with so many farmers in this race so far who are just\nScared to death of Gavin Newsom as governor or because they think they're going to their days will be number\n... I I think that's true actually I'm I'm ... I'm a\n... a symbol of your campaign that built the smelt\n[laughter] no you know the symbol of my campaign is somebody sitting in their car for two hours on a ... a\nLos Angeles or Orange County highway burning gasoline at four dollars a gallon muttering under their breath as they go over another pot hall and you know blow a tire or something like that\nAn insane to themselves boy I Love the weather I Love of what's going on and you know with the natural beauty of the state bank I get to look at the ocean every once in a while but\nYou know is it really worth it I'm living in a cracker box apartment paying Fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars a month or the rent just went up two hundred dollars a month last month and\nWhat am I going to do and we know when my kids get older and they're done with school\nWhere am I gonna live and retire I my kids going to be able to live here to begin with or where am I going to live and retire\nThese are the issues that people are thinking about Dennis and I'm hoping between now and November sixth day really hit home and people start thinking\nWe got to change this we can't continue the same path Gavin Newsom was going to make this worse yeah\nThat is exactly right uh what is your website\nJohn Cox for governor dot com and people can contribute there obviously we've got a lot of people have done that Dennis and I think there are\nPeople in this state you know some people tell me well in order to change we just have to go over the edge you know I mean we just have to have a crisis in the state\nBut you know what I don't want to get to that point do you get what we have a crisis in this thing well we do ... what does that be we'd have to say the middle class is leaving California I Know who are there are ... miles of homeless people\nI mean one ... one crisis or they are they talking about do we do we need to lose all electric power I mean I don't even understand\nThat's what I mean I think it's like the real life the frog that's being boiled and doesn't know what\nYou're absolutely right you know and you're right that the favor of the rolling blackouts that occurred back a couple of decades ago or so\nYou know these people could see that a course they felt that in Napa Valley this last a week where they actually had the power turned off a in part of that is because the forests aren't being managed the utilities aren't being managed but that's another story so maybe you're right maybe this is heading home to people and maybe they're going to realize that by November sect\nDo you have a special message to Hispanics in California absolutely\nUh you know they're being put upon as much worse than anybody else uh the the cost of housing the cost of gasoline and all the cost of living in this day and the lack of opportunity Dennis I Hope we get a chance\nThe course of the next couple of weeks to talk about that because my opponent was putting business by Gordon Getty and the billionaires in San Francisco I struggled I had to work my way up from the bottom I think that's a message for our Hispanic population that says you know we need to make sure that people have more opportunity in this day\nAll right listen tell me again the name of the website John Cox for governor dot com [noise] All right my friend will talk again thank you very very important dying goodness Prager every body John Cox Republican governor I'm telling you\nThese these within the shooting this this this is a big deal middle ruled\nYour main friends who have\nYes it did now I don't know whether they call themselves or death or not but the set up a was um that the they used the two letters S. S. because of ah of handler\nAnd what they did was they said this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you set up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted cash\nA and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the ... the organization had a rat line what Martin to garden I called the rat line from Germany to Italy general way Italy\nWhere they got these ss guys down there and put them on boats and then they went where they went most of them to Argentina where the ... government was bribed to allow them in\nAnd to keep them they're protected so the red cross out of Switzerland help BSS so did the F a beginning CIA\nAnd soda elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic\nSo all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in the book and then the track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat and they had to be badgered into tracking down Eichmann in manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's no surprises all across the book individual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil which has been me my story since I was in high school so I I asked a Holocaust survivor men who went through outfits the rabbi Leon rats ... passed away\nAnd I I was with him for many many years and I I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their seat as him\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the one thing I truly remember from my interview\nAnd he said they were monsters with human faces do you subscribe to that theory\n[noise] capsule literally means as his people didn't go to hell university and they and they weren't people who were uh in prison for violent crimes were\nFarmers shopkeepers lawyers\nWho before World War two live normal lives you saw him in the cafes you wave that um\n[noise] they're all of a sudden the war starts when they sign up they get a black uniform in a death set in ... to put on a cat they walk into our within other camps and they brutalized people to the extent that modern civilization has never seen they kill babies they gas when they do\nOh it's heinous evil things if anyone could imagine and then after the war they go back to the towns and they take up their farming again\nIt's unbelievable and that's why I wanted to tell everyone who reads the book and everyone that I Do these interviews with that evil exists in every person and you have to fight it you have to actively fight it or it can envelop you\nAnd if there's anything from killing the ss that's it\nFrom quiet because I'm I'm thinking of because of money for you to think about the uh so let me tell you something that I still audiences have my whole life the difference between my religious education and a regular secular education\nI was taught that my biggest problem in life is that is Prager in secular life there talk that their biggest problem is America and that's a very big difference when you learn to fight yourself or your word to fight your society\n[noise] Americans\nAre being misled primarily for political reasons about\nThe true nature of even I'm going to give you an example that everybody will be able to respond to and it's very short Kavanaugh hearings were ultra disturbing to me and millions of Americans because we saw an attempt\nTo destroy a human being and his family\nOkay now I don't know what happened\nI don't know\nChristine Ford I listen to her I never disparaged her but I don't know what happened and there's no corroborating evidence to say that anything happened [laughter] so I'm watching this thing and I'm watching Kevin are watching his daughters in March and his wife and I'm feeling it because I went

the belief that are not to use a Republican [noise] so that's one of the reasons this book is so important you were talking though about the the capital hearings go ahead\nYeah I was talking about a cabinet thing and then after Susan Collins the center for men gets up there and says look I got a a poll due process and the presumption of innocence women to vote for cabin on so he's he's confirmed now the day that he was confirmed\nA writer for the cold there program tweets well cabin on baby on the Supreme Court but at least we ruined his life\nAnd I have been harrowing trip tremendously interesting interviews and in\n... burst\nAmongst those interviews has been my reading to you\nFrom a column and nobody will go to a second column in the Washington Post they have a feminist column\nIn the Washington Post where women were feminists or or one I think in particular feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them on the plane last night\nAnd I I shared some of them with you know some of the quotes I think that these are so important to understand the damage that feminism and image if each make believe world\n... old is a step emanates from the left or make believe socialism is make believe and feminism is make believe you ... is make believe it's all make believe\nFor whatever reason and it's all psychological what ... ... it's there's no other explanation there is a beep beep beep uh\nUnhappiness\nMaladaptive ... to reality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who develop them they have contempt for the world as is\nConservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse or is the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea [noise]\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation\nBut overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream up something better which is what character respect the characteristic of the left remember from the boat to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen she writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a model leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have the feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left a but it is interesting that there is no mention in any of the columns by her or older women riding in this column in the Washington Post\nThat may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so low leads to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the word marriage does not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a buck cheat the there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to wish racial loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing\nTemporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely to watch the she described that I Know what I describe it to\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted a week long she said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that lie became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put in bold for myself to underline what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug it was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if the managing the driver CDs of patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy well and then she wonders why she's never been so lonely in her life\nBecause what the feminist like all must his lip and to make believe world\nReality it it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world were things will be better so she says if the fish the man is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flag that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every movie makes but of course that is exactly the way young men are talked today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this is they they just said that they want their cake and eat it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and belief not personal appetite and blind conquest you're going to move personal appetite from sex all the good obese care healing and relief sounds like a visit to a social worker or a therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October fifth do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise] so she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh destroy the title but listen to this again\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships and memorably can bring\n\nYou hear that this is a grown woman\nTheir children left his two children that horse they don't want to grow up I Want to be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional boots that dating and relationships inevitably can bring why don't you say that about anything else\nOpen to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that working for a living can bring\nI Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it memorably can bring\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart the children they do not want it to grow up growing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms and all of that stuff\nThey are snowflakes some of them are even nice snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups does it amazing thing she Mitch says like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post held only she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI now I continue reading at that moment it felt difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of the leaders feel stuck in the same dilemma really that's not true\nLeftist theaters are stuck in this dilemma conservatives have matured understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is a pain in life fish is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be at the end of may first oh\nBy the way just a reminder the mom my the rational bibles but the white five volume commentary on the first five volumes\nIt's been so successful the there were going on the fourth printing of accent is\nThe first volume was on the second book or if the prices going up to five dollars 'cause of the price paper it's printed on very beautiful paper\nSo you could still get the old price at um at Amazon if you want to get it and I'm just living you know this is the rational Bible\nAt any rate uh I I [noise] that book makes you aware\nThat genesis this is what human beings\nTo grow up you have to leave the garden of eating the left wants to re enter the garden the ... [noise]\nThey make believe starting to be in their mind\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six you are listening to the dentist Prager\nThe idea is that a man just is not assertive and then if he is assertive then he's obviously a not someone she feel safe with so no wonder she's lonely\nTired of it it's like I heard I don't know who it was a background that\nI thought as someone who may have had for both of them may be more strong feminist mission and now they're kind of struggling with how I found myself in that dichotomy you know I Want to hit the strong\nThat well right right yes I agree with you now that I agree with you know ... percent right but at no point to she challenged feminism [noise] but\nIt may be her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with that particular her than they'd eat there ever was\nWell I mean I'm a Democrat I so I have what he left progressive um positions but I think when it comes to this and my relationship and kind of my sense of\nOh now you know I I Am too nervous they're scared to do that again that's like human ...\nEither ... or whatever I don't know that already\nAttached to one side or another politically it's just\nOkay All right I appreciate your call very much a cafe in Torrance, California Hi Cathy\nHi Dana Hi [noise]\nUm I just called to allow him a ... a story that I heard from a recounting from my son about five years ago he is\nNow how old is your son thirty two so he you know Kate\nHow writes us probably four or five years ago [noise]\nUh he was telling me about child attempting to date and he said he found young and then sell aggressive\nThat when you're trying to get to know them at some little like a job interview they want to now on\nHow much money you have in my kind of car you drive and what your goals are at immediately you know not just a friendly let's get to know each other about a very aggressive grilling\n... so ironically if that's the case I have to pass the word is but if that's the case so the argument that men will see women as sex objects is ... is matched by women who see men as financial objects\nWhich by the way there is some truth to both not necessarily a terrible thing that just the way people were built we have to live with it\nWe have to figure out how to live with real life\nBut then if you do your homework
