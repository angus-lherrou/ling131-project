her\nThan it is [noise]\nDo everybody I'm Dennis Prager and this is broadcast every week because life is a challenge for the vast majority of people I Would say there's a tiny\nSliver of people for whom life has been pretty much a walk in the park I knew\nTo such people\nAnd then the last years were not walk at the park but it's very it's it's a it's unbelievably rare unbelievably rare\nIt's a four people it's varying degrees of challenge but that's that's the way it is that's the reason I ever happiness our reason I wrote a book on happiness so reason I lecture on it [noise]\n'cause if you can bring people to understand certain things and you can increase their happiness and if nothing else at least to have their act happier because that's a moral obligation not to inflict bad moods upon other people [noise]\nSo today's subject is a as a life change or if you take it seriously\nWe determine how others see us\n[noise]\nYeah if you get that people think that some objective reality determines how they are seen by others but the truth is your behavior determines how you are seen by others\n[noise]\nAnd I'll give you an example you you may recall the last show which is a remarkable woman Gail McWilliams who is blind and who if you meet her\nYou don't think about her blindness you just think about Gail Gail is is charming and Gail is full of life\nAnd that's in other words she's not when you when you deal with her you're not thinking the whole time she's blind you're thinking the whole time she scale\nThere are blind people with whom you would think the whole time that well I'm I'm dealing with a blind person\n\nFear are people who have I'm giving you some pretty dramatic ones and the issue here is not blame or anything like that is just to tell you the truth about how you are perceived and I'm going to give you other examples all of them are sensitive by the way everyone was sensitive example [noise]\nAnother one is ... parents who lose a child\n\nThat can become and I'm not blaming or anything else but I'm just describing the reality that can become their identity\nThere so and so she lost her son she lost a daughter he lost the daughter she lost to some or that is part of their by auto biography but it is not the defining element in how they are perceived\nBecause that's not what they\nRadiate when they meet you [noise]\nWhat ever it is you or the one who determines how others see you\n\nBut it's also true we'll give you another example for minorities whenever the minority might be racial\nOr sexual or\nA religious you determine by and large certainly in the United states and the United states\nYou determine how you are perceived\nIf you are a racial minority and you are\nOr your self perception is as a a primarily a victim of racism you will be regarded as overwhelmingly a member of that group rather than as job or\nSusan just take two common American names but probably not that common now frankly\nWe want to look up the most common names I should learn what they are and use them now what's the most common birth name of the west or had been for girls and boys [noise] this is this is a\nBig big deal you you are a you are in a religious minority\nYou you are the one who sets the agenda on the house majority will regard you know people and minorities don't think that way they think that that's how they're perceived\nThe whole time I suspect that there are are we haven't we have the names there the link or the link who need to link\nMe that was the main but it's okay it's okay you that are you into the na na na na na na I Know I Know that a real baby ... dot com and the answer is\nFor God as a sub nuisance okay here we go\nFor like I don't believe that Liam Liam\nIs the number one baby named for

Jew and I realized very early on it is up to me\nTo make everybody relaxed 'cause they ... it was a great it was a great revelation to me that the\nThe obligation ironically 'cause I I I Believe Americans have good will and couldn't care less your religious ethnic racial background doesn't matter you want if you're gay you set the agenda whether do they see you as Liam how's\nThat asked or as\nA gay guy you said that agenda do they see you as primarily black or Hispanic or in my case as a Jew or do they see you as Dennis\nBut doesn't deny that you're a Jew doesn't deny if you're a black

I I hear that at the beginning but it quickly changed when I felt\nWell part of the reason and and this is very important until ... if I'm wrong in your case tell me but I think part of the reason is what you mentioned very it's a very beginning they weren't that many Mexicans in Michigan so see so if that was it advantage to you\nBecause when you are at an immigrant community and you can stay with that community in a in a self imposed ghetto then you are primarily that I'm not Bob\nI agree with that because and and other cities in Michigan where I grew up there were REO so to speak but in the city I grew up there wasn't weren't so we are intermingled with everyone and we didn't have that uh\nSo now that you're in San Antonio where there are barriers one at one of you done\nOne of the fact that you know what to do is I stop\nTerms of where you live a ...\nDo you live in a Mexican community orange the Mexican community are mixed\nNo electric humanity like 'cause I needed something close to the airport and that was you know\nI'm a gotcha I Gotcha well it's a joy to talk to you thank you Bob how is that Mexican\nFrom Michigan number Mexican from Michigan Mexican from Michigan\nI like it or like\nA yes you know what the world is divided between there are a lot of you know as a lot of those is divided between those who acts those why those ... those away there's one divided between the healthy and unhealthy\nFor healthy and uh is is quite healthy is on me I also happen to be X or y or Z in terms of of whatever that differing I'd been to be used but for the first and foremost them I'm Me\nThat's good that's good that's what America was founded to be ... for many warm doesn't mean you drop your your specific culture or if or background or religion of course\nIf it's your choice on that\nOne a prank or seven seven six and we go to Christopher in sun west says the sun city west excuse me are and what what state is that\nFrom the what Arizona\nOkay so that's a easy got to tell our screener OK it's hard to know all fifty initials\nOdds to hold on there I don't want to\nAll right everybody we aren't allowed to do is go fast I mean we're not done yet it put it's already coming up to the final say one of his vision of the happiness or if you want to give him as a rare chance [noise]\nAnd I remind you that it's brought to you by\nCall eight hundred six five one o seven mining robocalls Frazier the happier [noise]\nThis is like you got\n\n[noise]\nYou have my head in the day of battle amen based on a true story of an army chaplain and his wife and I only stand before you today because Jesus as my right hand because I have a family who loves him release of\nMarriage one family under God she may be a free said family\nFight health I think we all have indivisible rated PG Thirteen maybe inappropriate for children under Thirteen in theaters October twenty six for tickets in show times go to indivisible movie dot com\nBill O'Reilly here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth\nIt's about Nazi evil and those who enabled it the ... on you as Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books have sold more than twelve million copies\nSo I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time\nGold is a better way gold is a better way gold is a better way dot com imagined doing business with the company that seeks to add massive valued before asking for your business Hi my name's Adam ... on the corner of advantage gold and the author of the now national best selling book gold is a better way\nIs still may not be for you but if you're like most people you'll be blown away when you learn why goal to set the short over ten thousand dollars and a bonus for hitting the bestsellers list I been gifted two hundred and fifty copies from my publisher\nGiven IRA or four one K. with over a hundred thousand dollars I Want to send you a copy of the national best selling book you can buy it on Amazon or go to Barnes and noble or be among the first two hundred and fifty people to reply\nJust text weren't best seller for nine seven seven six\nThat's best seller too for nine seven seven sixty claim your free national best selling book now that's the word best seller for nine seven seven six we promised that massive valued forever asking for your business just catch the word best seller to for nine seven seven six\nThe original batteries flashlights involved says the weather changes from car batteries the generator batteries and bold for any need from devices to be those\nBatteries plus bulbs has what you need a better than box store prices you can find everything you needed one of the six area battery plus ... stores and right now get twenty five dollars significance for half price in the store near you go to W.
