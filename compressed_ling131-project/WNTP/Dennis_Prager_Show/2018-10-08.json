Democrats Harvard law professor darker than the coffee is\nEven though if you read the report of ritual Mitchell the woman who seems to have asked you know ... very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide bunny assessment of Dr Ford's allegations in a legal context\nAnd the legal context here as my bottom line a she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove what this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell ate a prosecutor of sex crimes duck the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee neuro nor do I believe is evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence that interview understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... from not mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just for ... live but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThat Republicans ... to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote one week as the FBI made and visual inquiries\nAnd midway guys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice [noise]\nNow if in fact we get word that the FBI has done and that should all centers will have their report it's okay to file the notion of cloture because that says thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat is right down to the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or in other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I catch a more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to them because the institution of America has not yet adopted to deal with age but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nOf the fear of flying narrative that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraph inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nCould not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that are very rare [noise]\nAnd then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems whether testimony\nWell there are some awesome well a ritual Mitchell a that was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um and I thought did a very professional job\nBut I thought she got the basic facts out the demonstrated that there are gaps I understand that victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated\nAllegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry Adler the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month proceedings I say bring those on because they will be laughing stocks about Seventy rule I just got into it and she said Brett Kavanaugh why I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a center\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous and I'm sure we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful and attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're all from this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts as five friend the majority leader likes to say uh after continued to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cutting number Fifteen what about these red states have such\nAll of them all up\nAll of them politically in any of the only two that are open seemingly ... even though there is no senator\nCornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think that uh I think the judicial I mean I'm sure I'm so I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what ones you just said\nAs the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as a base with confirmed\nThat you know I think things very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because if they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and uh this uh this ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or hug not display the appropriate temperament on the bench\nThis man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time and in particular where he asked judge or senator corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut they shouldn't be expected just to take a business slander these allegations of\nCriminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified in a showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be a blight some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge cabinet I I think it will be a huge mistake unless there is direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen that they this way is that the general sense in the ...\nWell I think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for ah for the judge\nIn the middle of this political debacle another letter blurted out there was from the president of the American bar association Robert Carlson says my sale it'll colleague Larry Elder remember that letter that the\nPresident of the ab a sets urging the Senate Judiciary committee to hold off voting on\nJudge Kavanaugh until the FBI investigation and then it was written by the president of the ... name of Robert crossing turns out Robert Carlson deny permission from the standing committee to send that letter and they're unhappy that he sent it without their permission and they're unhappy that people are suggesting that the ... has withdrawn its support of Brett Kavanaugh they have not\nPoured negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst abusers of the trade laws and on the planet one other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump had his past outbreaks of one of the points you made\nIs he said look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but boy is it working because these countries are reducing our church\nIt's even a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries\nAnd the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI Do it you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped pass NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this was the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement is now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer\nBut it is a new on North American free trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries is modernized because America has a better deal and so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this do you also got me on that one that's not you know we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan a show I mean I agree with you on that\nOne so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just in just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we've talked about this on your show before the war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property we produce computer software we\nHundreds Patton sent copyrights and and acknowledge each and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and something and certainly trying on and many other countries and Asian countries they just steal or an electoral property and this new uh I'll call it the U.S a CNA has much better\nProtections for not America's intellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them\nTo the entire interview with economist Stephen Moore on tonal review dot com coming up\nOn an alien hours of taxpayer money went to prepare religion America's religion for the discovery of extra terrestrial life\nSounding the alarm on bureaucratic ways to limit tell the story\nOf sarin\nNews I'm Rhonda roster of NTSB is on the scene of a horrific accidents go higher in New York\nThat happened over the weekend twenty people died when a limo apparently ran a stop sign and hit a parked issue V.
