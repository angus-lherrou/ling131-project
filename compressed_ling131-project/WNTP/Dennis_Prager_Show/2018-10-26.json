through sponsorship and your business is important and I urge everybody who wants to payroll processing or a chart done by a company with a guy like Tom who's really of like minded patriots\nBecause you made a point about visiting with a Congressman Steve ... she was almost killed on a baseball field in Virginia\nRight and and I think this is something if if everybody could take a moment and pause and think about the attack that happened in the baseball field\nIn DC right or Virginia or a year ago right and how they discovered that the perpetrator was a Bernie Sanders volunteer right and he had an actual hit list in his pocket right Republicans that he was going after literally and the way that the uh media treated that situation including\nYou know the fact that he's going to the very fortunate manned and to beat him and he's humble and grateful and\nHe does not carry it is not carry a grudge rice and compared to the coverage and the attribution or blaming that's going on right now is absolutely disgusting\nIt's insane I mean it's a it's a tale of two stories I mean it's all the the the hypocrisy it's like we almost forgot now you wait and see the coverage of this nuts that they've arrested um and it certainly the president is going to speak from this uh the young black leadership summit and address these comments\nBut I I promise you there or if this guy is indeed there's his van is covered with pro Trump stickers apparently and all that abuse of some some lunatic crazy person who happens to support President Trump there'll be more media coverage about that\nOn the eve of the terms then there were the congressional baseball field shootings of last year\nYou were writing correct and the question is going to be how connected was ... or is he just somebody who

St Paul yesterday in Minneapolis today I Am so fair minded that I Do that when I come to the twin cities I take care of each twin\nWe had a truly remarkable even being last night about ... seven hundred I could say that any more about that I Do know I really do see an empty seat often you hear that but it's not literally true but I I mean they may have been but I didn't see one\nTo all of you who came thank you and again it was a wonderful evening\nWave at Morsi of the local station and the ... say I'm told maybe the Patriot one of my favorite and Larry Elder and Michael ... there was really ah\nI I Wish there was an evening that I I I Wish every left wing or in the country could have seen what what how we talk\nJust amongst ourselves and the civility of it and the lack of a trigger it would be fascinated to contrast that with a similar evening of people on the left to an audience on the left but\nI don't know how I Would do it but I Would like to talk to about a little moral leader 'cause I Want to talk a little bit about the last question was asked but in the meantime they have found a suspect\nOr\nThey have arrested a suspect me in these\nAren't even know what to call them what the real bombs whatever they were sent to all these people on the left avid so far it looks like it looks like the man is a a a ... on the right\nAnd he has a a a they have his band and fan is\nPlastered with Donald Trump stickers and the like so we will ah let's see we have even more information just coming in now he's in his fifties\nAnd let's see what else we can say arrest made in connection with mailed explosive devices wide ban outside plantation auto zone appears to be focus of investigators\nAnd if you get the pictures of it or you can see the the the pro Donald Trump stickers\nAnd the other people look it's conceivable the guys on the left that he wants to make believe these are the right but I I suspect that this is the real deal he's simply a he was already it's interesting he'd already been arrested in the past he has a record for making terror threats\nWhy people who make terror threats are not in jail is want to\nBuy a boat rentals I don't understand why they have to actually acted out [noise] you can't threaten death terror\nAnd the like and that would be sufficient to place you are in prison I I don't know I'm a I'm just a question that I Am posing\nSo on is going to happen and it's already happening is you see we told you it's a Trump rhetoric the cause of Trump's rhetoric that caused the truck prior to Donald Trump to be left and the right got along great so left was not calling us all of us all of us all of us racists\nAnd all I I'm not ... they were not calling the police are racists\nAnd even on occasion pigs this none of this was happening guy who pay portrays the ... the police's pigs on his socks in a in a a football game in a is a chosen by Nike to be at spokesman ... this is all this is all because of Trump presumably\nA wedding that Charles Murray uh one of the most thoughtful up people in the country uh it goes to speak at Middlebury College and or is it physically attacked in a woman oh the professor with him is injured by left wing students now that's all Trump\nShe ... this is the amazing thing\nOnly only for rights abuses hate is is the lie the one of the grand lies I should make a list I have to\nDo that for myself the grandest of the laws the greatest of allies is that America is racist the or the other uh number one is that we were Nazis\nRight I mean come on and and you remember how fast the steam Scalia and the uh the shooting at\nAt a Republican congressman putting a baseball game mouth fast that disappeared from the news I mean you get updates on Steve ... is going to be used as a condition and that would be it\n\nBut now this thing right right it just before the elections I mean this guy aside from just being ... evil in his ... and sick is stupid stupid\nEvie if if if the left could have invented the guy they would have invented the guy if he turns out to be the right wing or is that it that it apparently he he is I say apparently because of the of the van but as soon as I heard ... and then in ... in the beginning I thought this could this could\nWell be a guy on the left because it's so often these hoaxes to take place but as more information came in and my thought about it more than I realized who the targets for it's hard for me to imagine these these were the ideal targets of somebody who does have people on the left I don't know if the people on the left would have picked the same\nTargets if they were trying to blame the right and we'll find\nOut more than I Will let you know any more information as it is revealed to the public of the United states of America [noise] so I have a very interesting thing for you here very interesting [noise]\nToday uh let's see David Brooks in the New York times who ... the the New York times has three columnist out of about\nTwenty that are not on the left and David Brooks is one of them\nAre there are none that are on the right\nThere are non leftists which is fine but they're they're not really on the right eye number words I don't I don't believe I Know for a fact there was not a single pro Trump columnist of the twenty twenty five columnist for the New York times not one\nHalf the country is pro Trump and not a single columnist they could not find a human being as ... I take that back of course they could find a human being they would not publish a human being who was pro Trump on the opinion page\nOn the New York times of the New York times so but David Brooks is not is not on the left he's just he's a couple of plays a centrist and he's quite anti Trump but he wrote a piece in which she spoke about how beautiful nationalism is that he is a nationalist he's not a global as\nWhich in the New York times that gutsy thing to do of course he spoke about how Donald Trump\nIs probably a good nationalist either because otherwise he would be unacceptable to the New York Times' readership defeated and also attack\nDonald Trump I'm not saying it's not some searing it unfairly telling you that that's what happened but the article the column was a pro nationalism pieces I remember I spent some time on that it's very important\nThe president said he's a nationalist any attack the global lists and he was last data CNN and I played the laughter I mean they actually laughed at it\nSo now I what I find even more interesting than the columns are the comments by readers so I Want to repeal showed the comments of New York times readers to what New York times\nColumn\n... the virtues of nationalism in which he says I Love my nation you know and it's a good thing to love your nation and my you know I I feel more for my nation than I Do for another nation just as I feel more from my family than another family\n\nAnd I want other nations to love their nation right all of which I upset very often myself so listen to some of the uh some of the letters that are written and again I'll give you updates are with regard to uh anything in Florida here with the suspect of the bombing\nSo here's number one ... the times picks\nMay have times picks there were three uh\nThere are three a list that's the word three lists of comments from New York Times pick list the readers pick list and all so this is the times ...\nThat sounds like patriotism to me and there's a difference nationalism is historically been used to know the superiority of the nation to the detriment of other nations in the world community nationalism as arrogance and false pride\nNationalism can blind citizen to the need for critical thinking at assessing ones country's policy\nSo you see this is this is a big issue this is really really big\n[noise]\nLashed loads of nationalism ... that is one of us as fundamental\nAs the left belief in big government is to smash [noise]\nWe will return one eighth Prager seven seven six\nTo see a the idea of that Santa Claus can only be wiped out would be that would be racist but I think [noise]\nBut is Santa Claus the ... the legend of Santa Claus coming from Europe\nAnd coming and and the you know for kids another disease from the north pole the people in the north well I guess really north I guess you might be a more of a ... think of it have Eskimo\nBut anyway it's an it's an audit charge that if if if you hang your hat on she said Santa Claus is white\nAh\n[noise] it doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks that blacks should be mistreated\nOr is that they are inherently inferior in some way I but tell me I'm very I really am curious 'cause I I'm not I'm not up on my triggers here\n\nAbout uh that's interesting thing\nJust said to me by Sean so this is joy bay are dressed as a a beautiful African woman for Halloween this is from twenty sixteen\nOr or like I I don't know the the rules are very complex I got to tell you as you know the University of California has a big list of micro aggressions things that you can things you can say\nThat reveal that you're a racist I mean you are racist if you say you you don't view the only race you think to exist as the human race\nThat actually that actually matter one or two but Barrow thing I think Cuba or but I'm Glad to be a thank you for working that hard\nAnd moves\nMe it ... me that the shoulders working that hard\nAll right anyway any any more news on all of that or I Will I Will bring it through tension won a prank or seven seven six or our lines at work at an age everybody checked on the lines were good All right [noise] but I I Will get back because\nYou have no idea how revealing it is [noise] how much the word nationalism\nRankles people on the left [noise] and you know this is not a theoretical stuff if

overriding important issues nationalism\nShowed David Brooks New York times non last is one of the three mountain left is Ross Douthat that embraced the fans are the other two has written this column I'm a nationalism and says I Am a national is not a global ...\nCan you tell me anything that cannot cause evil is there anything you can think of is there any belief of course not doesn't exist\nWater is necessary for life but you can drown if there's too much water right if you were in ingest the water and can't breathe I mean it's it's a simple analogy almost simplistic but it's accurate\n\nOne of the things you that you one day you wake up and you realize the less not only poisons everything it touches it's not intellectually base\nThis is the real shock because it's intellectuals who tend to be leftists so you think that there's an intellectual foundation for left isn't bill\nIntellectuals love left ism but there is no intellectual foundation for it the opposition to nationalism is emotional all of left as it is emotional\nLoading of the order created by the Judeo Christian West that's ultimately what it is about\nSo I'm reading to you these\nComments by New York times readers to David Brooks column where he says I hey I'm I'm a nationalist and I'm not a global as they got away with it because he also attacked Donald Trump\nOtherwise the otherwise you might have felt like he was defending the president and that's not tolerable in the pages of the New York times so more comments it's well past time to stop the

they will know that they may be challenged or even a God Forbid really God Forbid\nOffended that knows that works\nSo here it is every body and the what made me think of this topic was actually the last hour the previous hour talking about nationalism [noise] so I have a theory and you've\nProbably heard me say that oh one thousand or so times 'cause I have a lot of theories about life\n... theory that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more\nAnd if you have more or\nIf you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are and they are and know a new order of important ... just three identities that\nI think are they are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a loan doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they are great contribute towards towards happiness or sexual identity male or female a national identity and a religious identity\nI think in my lifetime I have\nSeen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those and I won't even identify them cause it to happiness our want everybody to listen and everybody to be as comfortable as possible\nBut there are those who are working to\nNotify those identities and say that they they really are not real and if they are not even good book that's\nTherefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population by knocking these identities\nWon a Prager seven seven six so that I Believe that the more comfortable you are with being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl\nAnd that is that is a serious part of your identity sir\nI Will be totally over by a graphic here I have always been I'm very lucky I admitted both been comfortable with being mail\nI've never wanted to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and I I celebrate to ... to ... to whatever extent that celebrate a boy I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgendered and I'm not even attacking the trench either on the contrary there's not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nOr bend your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness it it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it's something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try to filter maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you gotta really deny reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness\nWe're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female\nSo that's one identity I identity is in fact almost been given a bad name oh he has an identity ooh that's not that's not good next is a national identity I think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nIn it and I think uh I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness\nAnd I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I'm a man\nOr or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more I identify as this is my thesis of this happiness our the more you identify with\nThe the greater your chance for happiness in third as a religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is for Christians obviously the majority great majority that you're listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're a Mormon if you're if you're Catholic if your Protestant if you're evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every it it could it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee of life\nYou can be a you can be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show my bragging\n\nI was the moderator and there's a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then there were members of fourth religion\nAnd I\nWould get calls people would call him and I remember how many people called and it was amazing to me so much so that at one time there were so many people who identify themselves to tell you how do I know so I just want to say that the priest almost ... Catholic or I'm a recovering Catholic and I\nI I I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves like nobody called the say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter] so ... we had this this I these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called that he was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns who would do is apparently raptors locals with a ruler when he was when he was twelve I told them you know I Am and I'm not Catholic but it seems to me after Seventy eight years you might want to give that up [noise]\nAny way I I Know that in my life those three identities religious national\nAnd sexual have been major contributors [noise]\nAnd I know that there is a sort of a war against those identities today and I think all that will do is decreased human happiness\nI had to take your calls eight seven seven to for three triple seven six the happiness our problem is that a Springer show\nWell look uh I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says is true\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it very well there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely would be\nBut if it's a challenge to find a kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't that interesting I of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics but interesting\nIt's a very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that\nUh in in Chicago hello and Dennis Prager\nNana thank you so much for taking my call long time

general approach is to clarify where we differ it comes across as extremely aggressive totally non defensive\nBoth so you're not defending you and you're not in attacking them just say listen we're we're both here to study and we're both students and or you know we're good guys and so on and so what I like to do just what I like to do is I like to figure out where it is I I might differ with
