conservative talk\nIn mind Gallagher\nAre so honored to be spending an hour with Newt Gingrich you're on the Gallagher showing the relief factor dot com studios Mr Speaker I never thought I'd get inspired by the Washington Post\nBut I I've interviewed Dan Balz a number of times over the years of various political conventions and debates and all and he wrote a piece this week headlined battleground house districts remained close in New poll\nUm he he says that according to a new Washington post poll of the most contested districts in the country\nThe Democrats now hold a statistically insignificant lead over Republicans again it's not supposed to happen that way there's this was supposed to be occurring Newt are or do we dare dream that the narrative that the Democrats are going to take the house\nBut Republicans are going to control continue to control the Senate\nIs not going to happen and the Republicans have a chance of holding both chambers\nAnd all kinds of I think social anybody who tells me they know what's going to happen or just remember that two weeks out of everybody will she knew that Donald Trump would lose on election day uh five thirty eight the the\nNew York times found the polling operation said there was a Seventy one percent likely to Italy would when I'm\n... you know virtually no one you know I was safe but some cry that I said for a long time I went and but but I think this far out a loser dynamic developing we'll see how the dynamic continues but but for the last few each part of a dozen I've written about this in my newsletters\nAgain which productions um the uh\nThe cabinet affect the sweetest thing one\nIt galvanized the concert then she got really angry at the sort of sleepwalking and happy and lots of good things but now they're angry and that's a huge increase in energy on the right which I she personally and I'm sure you see that the rounds you're going to do an amazing look much more energy\nThan I can remember it anytime a in many many years a second\nI'm mass came off\nOh I think that the nastiness position as the Spartacus moment my book or a the the the shouting over the chairman but by the Democratic senator from California Kamala Harris down the list them all Harris I mean\nPeople will be under the degree to which they are willing to exploit Dr Ford manipulate her keep her letter hitting spraying it at the last minute maximize public relations um people get a sense that\nYou know these people are really bad and I think that the Damascus continue to come off as we see more and more bad statements and more and more bad comments on the third thing that happened was all of a sudden particularly the Senate races\nPeople realized oh yeah this is a team sport and so somebody like greatest it would've been desperately trying to convince people in Tennessee than it was a moderate they looked up and they said wait a second you're going to vote for Schumer\nWell you want to moderate if she got a little pressure on the latest polls that just came out this week show hike camp for example down sixteen points\nNow nobody and she's a very very competent a political figure she's very good campaigner has a very long track record not to go to nobody would have guessed that she'd be down sixteen points\nAnd everywhere you turn now racist that the Democrats thought they were going to win a very very tight um you know early voting we're seeing a Republicans are doing very well know again I don't I don't want to draw any any conclusion we still have almost two weeks\nAnd two weeks out I think Donald Trump would have lost\nBut he was gaining boats every single day right and we keep gaining boats every single day and frankly a caravan is is a is a huge burden for the Democrats\nThat they just can't I think the answer to that and I think among suburban a woman who have been one of the real weaknesses for Trump because they think about him is Thirteen gangs and they think about cartels and they think about a lawlessness\nAnd seven thousand people determined to break the law I think they meet the Democrats and come back to the Republicans are in a much greater number then people would have guessed a month ago\nIs it just me or does it feel ... you're talking about prominent Democrats and the missteps of the last month or so I mean and you could go to Elizabeth Warren and her bizarre a\nDecision to release this DNA test and create a whole wave of of ridicule and scorn or the mob violence we're seeing we're seeing a Heidi Heitkamp I mean for crying out loud she's she tells the world she was ready to vote yes on Kavanaugh until she watched his testimony with the sound turned off\nAnd she didn't like his facial expressions doesn't it feel like the Democrats are a bit like the gang that couldn't shoot straight\nAnd I think they have a huge problem I think their their base so far less now\nAnd the energy at their base and the hatred that their base has for Trump is so intense yeah but they're surrounded all day by people who are giving them signals uh that don't work in the normal world\nRight and so who you know comments like em I'm sure that that when the former attorney general said when the Republicans you're down or will probably go low we kick kick him I'm sure in that immediate crowd they liked it\nBut for the rest of the country it it was a little sobering to have somebody who's been cheap law enforcement I've seen it in states suggesting that Republicans want to get checked threat and it comes to comes in the middle of the whole way of these kind of states ... ... and the other the other part of it is frankly a\nGeneration of left wing activist to get goofy things and said goofy things who are now running for office and we live in an age where YouTube and others allow us to track you know things he did so it's not just where they have an oddity thirty six years ago right one and a lot of these candidates last year the year before Rand it ain't pretty\nBig earlier than the Democrats\nWe're going to see if it's going to be pretty in the morning or November the seventh I'll tell you what I loved was getting to spend an hour with you Mr Speaker thank you for taking time out of what I Know is a crazy schedule for you and you're going back and forth with your wife in Rome and all the great things that are happening in in Gingrich land thank you Mr Speaker keep fighting the good fight we need your voice\nDrawn Spicer along with my colleagues or some of my colleagues in the Salem review\nAnd it continues as I test out airlines on a daily basis here I I'll tell you one thing that I Do get a chance to test brought traveling so much is\n... in the market for an SUV for the first time in my life and what I Do is I rent SUVs and it's it's a nice way of testing out SUVs\nAre the real road for a day\nSo that's where my ... that's part of what I have been doing so or the or the\n...\nThe press is the media or preoccupied with these bombs or these make believe bombs I'm not even sure which are bombs which are make believe bombs which could work which wouldn't work none of them did work\nThank God obviously nobody has a clue who was sent them and yet we have the following as a given from the media and I'm going to play Mika Brzezinski or for you from MSNBC\nOne point that is just worth making\nI don't know if in a free society in a in a police state you you might have this but in a free society I'm not sure in fact the perceptions of reality among\nThe the two halves are between the two halves of the society ideologically has ever been as different\nFor all intents and purposes Mr Brzezinski him I Do not live in the same society we did not live in the same country one of us is spectacularly wrong\nAnd it it it it's a really it's a sobering assessments one of us is staggeringly wrong\nIt's not on a new launch thing so listen to what she has to say and then they'll tell you what I have to say and you will decide or at least conjecture here she is today um MSNBC\nDemocrat I I think ... now and say that we're a little ... springs that [noise]\nI Want to be honest I highly reactive Atlanta ... about this president [noise] and I've found some of that even the forest [noise]\nWe don't have a sense a pack a day but I Do now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that ... that of all that top Democrats in the ... what the target at\n...\n... watches the what was the inevitable rhetoric that top Democrats would be targeted\nNow I Know what they'll say about media and ... you said that the un American Me of the people now if I could have maker Brzezinski on the show this is what I Would ask her I Would say\nI'd like to establish where our perceptions of reality begins to defer when they have to start at some point would similarity so where do they fear so for example do do you wish you'd knowledge that\nIn the last two years since this president has nearly two years since he's been elected\nThat people on the right have been far more harassed including politicians then people on the left\nThe candidates I've read to you folks were candidates have been pushed or shoved or punched aware they had been screened that curse that\nI don't know of any parallels with regard to left wing politicians\nRight wing ... about his Republican House members were shot at and by sheer grapes heroism and luck none were killed no democratic congressmen have been shot at\nIn these past two years since he was elected\nPlus ... why is\nThe mainstream media light coming of Donald Trump to Hitler why is that not a coal to violence I don't I don't\nWhen I say I don't understand ... most people say when they don't I don't understand the releasing I disagree I tried to be really precise so when I don't understand I don't understand I don't understand why\nYour side would not regard why could mean the president to Hitler\nAs a coal to violence\nWould not be obligatory on old Laurel people to kill a ...\n\nI I Would think it would be personally I [laughter] if somebody could have assassinating Hitler in the Nineteen thirties van ... or ... approximately fifty million innocent would have been saved\nIt would've been one of the greatest act to goodness in the history of the world so I'm I'm not quite understanding\nNot arguing with her I I don't know what does that mean a battle of his conspiracy theories versus left wing conspiracy theories\nIf I talk that I'm clearly I really don't deserve a radio show this is not to insult to it it it's the whole left does that\nThey make these massive charges and I I ... I don't know what they're referring to what does that mean a battle of conspiracy theories\nIs it a conspiracy theory a does she think it's a conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in a in the last election\nI'm curious what she acknowledged that that's a conspiracy theory bribery you haven't heard much about that lately have you\nWonder why\nWhat if it turns out to be essentially nothing\nIs what will happen nothing\nLeft lies dominates the media for a year or two with allies they turn out to be lies and then they move onto the next lie that's the way it works there is no shame one of the joys of being on the left is never having to say you're sorry I've ever feeling embarrassed\nThat they have dragged this country through this fraud of Russian collusion\nThe leading the most is dean of the left wing media the New York times the Washington Post ABC CBS NBC NPR PBS and nothing it turns out to probably have been nothing\nThey apologize you kidding are you kidding you are kidding go on please\n... ... to ... so violent ...

more conservative wandering government and more conservative what a mall and government not only to placate that and create some harm there but all the time it with us elections on and to create\nA okay All right I I got older I got a lot of questions here so I I happen to know by\nBy sheer will not totally sure chance I I I cared a lot to know but I did go down to Honduras at the time with his lawyer a controversy or when she tried to install himself undo the constitution and installed himself for another term as president\nAnd the ... the Supreme Court of ... and the Congress even his own party said that this is an untenable a book or he or she persisted in any event and then was kidnapped admitted it was it was remarkable of time and a number in history so my first question is\nWhat ... what\nDoes the left in a in Latin America half the game with this caravan\nMay be more and I I Want to be more precise may be the miscalculated it seems to me and I think to a fair number of Democrats who she's only helping the Republicans absolutely\nAnd I think there was a greatness calculation um you know especially if they were trying to affect\nUs election or U.S policy and for example with the liar in Honduras and and you get a great explanation of that history with the ... it's basically an ongoing war with the current government and it's basically this continuous battle with the current government\nBut the destabilizing Central America or not she stabilizes our ability it drives read in our relationship we thought that they you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship\nBut when you have this well a migration coming across the border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't understand that but Central America\nPeople to flow freely from Honduras Nicaragua back and forth you know to various theories of Central America on it so they can't really just close the border down if people have their paperwork\nSo what the Guatemalan government was doing while I was there as they had buses ready to go they were explaining to the people that a United States is not going to let you in\nThat the Mexican government that this is a very dangerous journey and there were some children there that they had been lied to please hit on the bus let us get you back home let it get you back home safely now of course the organizers of the group we're talking against that now we're moving forward we're going forward\nBut Guatemala was able to actually return nearly\nAccording to their their calculation around thirty nine hundred to four thousand people back to Honduras the problem however Dennis with that once the caravan started moving moving through Guatemala moving to Mexico and moving into Mexico more and more people were joining end\nSo now you have it swelled to estimates right now are like fourteen thousand\nCreating a potential problem for the U.S as they move towards the border which is the reason why the department of defense today\nUnder a James Mattis is now looking at a point eight hundred troops to the border on to the U.S border in order to stop\nThe penetration of these people from coming into the United states should be some kind of turn you remember this is a catch women and children which of course are going through it very treacherous track through these countries um and and you know the heat and exhaustion and everything else that goes with it that dangerous to their own physical body\nAnd the criminality that's contained within the groups I mean I remember to them is Thirteen\nAnd within the group that came in across the Guatemalan border we don't have background on these people that are coming in we lived

to skip the station McCall\nWell my friends the\nThe general tone of course of the media is what do you expect Donald Trump has been fomenting old was violent hatred and that's the reason for these bombs pseudo bombs real bombs not real bombs ... I don't I don't really know yet\nAnd the\n... that I have a vote I offered at the beginning of the last hour is very simply the ... the amount of rhetoric of hate and of\nCalls for in your face physical behavior and the actual violent behavior has been so overwhelmingly from the left\nThat ... it's it's almost surreal that people would say it's the president's rhetoric\nAbout forgetting these this bomb issue about which we know nothing would regard to who sent them and why but putting putting that aside\n\nWhat speakers are threatened at colleges do you know for the first time in my life of decades of lecturing\nI have asked for security when I go to Colorado State next week I have never asked for security I've been given it routinely but it it it's it to me it always struck me as a sort of pro forma funding you know two wonderful police officers would accompany me for my car\nBut in this case I actually asked for\nThe rhetoric of hatred that has been directed against me in the in the Colorado State newspaper is is quite remarkable\nIf it is it is probably like lives it is all made up everything about me is made up everything\nAnd it doesn't it doesn't matter to them because the truth is not a left wing value wife said that my whole life this proceeds Donald Trump this perceived Ronald Reagan this perceives ah\nIt it emanates from my study of the left from a college graduate school um\nIt has never been a left wing value it's a liberal values are conservative value but it's not a left wing value\nAnd fishes this is a perfect example on my mind is what I mean there are there are so many and the calls to violence but you wouldn't even Mika Brzezinski acknowledged Maxine Waters\nTelling people get into the face of of politicians I Wonder why I'd like to know the last time that a member of Congress to the United states told people to act on civil e towards fellow congressman\nOf the other party I I Wonder if there is a precedent to Maxine Waters truly an ugly human being who am I Am not speaking of her physically I remember in my life talk about people's physical looks and there's nothing to do with that fuse ugly in character in temperament\nAnd decency and morality\nAnd it it but it doesn't matter because it's you know it doesn't matter\nTo her credit Mika Brzezinski after blaming the president then goes through the ... many of you know including Hillary Clinton\nWill only be civil if we win because she said that there was last week Lori Clinton overturned disability after we win\nYes what the ah the face of the left is coming through\nThere is a way to defeat the left though there is a way to embolden liberals as opposed to a leftist I managed to defeat them in this upcoming election you see it will be very hard for the left to convince the Democrats\nAnd the crowds there are after all liberal Democrats not all are leftist they support all left his party to their shame but they're not all leftists but they will have a harder sell hey our way is the better way\nIf they can't even beat Donald Trump\n... owning owning the colleges owning the high schools owning\nThe newspapers owning the cable networks except for

to the past but it's really part of the current American situation you may recall the people who wanted to remove Andrew Jackson from the twenty dollar bill is probably the most controversial though everybody now for the left is controversial to live before them [noise]\nAh so that's not telling you much but uh we have a scholar on here professor of history and American studies in Hillsdale College Bradley ... just written a new book\nWhich I Will be reading 'cause I I'm just finishing sliced sheer coincidence in some very very very very very very very long book on Andrew Jackson\nAnd I'm real interested in the American president and general and so I'm Bradley ... professor of history book is in defense of Andrew Jackson\nAnd professor welcome to the dentist Prager show\nTenets Hi thank you so much for having me on great on her\nThat's very kind of you to say I am honored show the ... the the indictment of Andrew Jackson is I think largely over his treatment of American Indians is that fair to say\nYeah I think that's probably at least since the late Nineteen sixty that's been the great critique of the ...\nAnd of course that's kind of ... feet into all kinds of culture and especially the textbooks that our children are reading so yeah that that's where it came from and generally there other things that people will argue about but definitely the Indians problem is the main problem that comes up with him\nRight so what is your defense\n[laughter] oh [laughter] what a great question [laughter] especially since I have a book titled that it\nCan yeah I agree it's a little unfair yeah\nAny well it is and it's also kind of one of those titles that that we've touched me in the age right it's a [laughter] right exactly but you know there are a lot of things that we could say about Jack the terms of putting into the contacts\nWhen it comes to the actual Indian removal I think that ... intentions were good but the way that it played out is just horrible certainly it would be very difficult to argue that the way that ... removed from the southern\nWas and of course I I'm I understand ready to go to commercial but the point I wanted to make was that at that time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people need to really really\nWent after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water and the reason was because as president as he's\nReally cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the Indians and for the resettlement west there were a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of white people\nSo that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral do what we left off at a at the time it was a really complicated issue in Jackson was very worried\nQuestion he was worried that the whites and blacks would have very very high procreate a birth rate that they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them out populating them\nSo removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures that we used to the thought now the again the execution of it was horrible but\nHis intention I think was generally a good one [noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book or is it important book now you don't normally defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I've found so I think we all know that and it's true that Jackson was an incredibly violent man there's just no way around that in every way he was but he also had really certain rules so that violence never ever could be applied to women or children\nThat was the same ... actually for blacks as well as for Indians and white\nGet a deep respect strangely enough or beautiful enough yet it's strange interesting respect that women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost ... times and he treats again Indian women as well as black woman in white wearing very very well but\nThe other thing I found about him so he's got his violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting but I also found that has been you know counter so many current politicians\nThe guy was just unbelievably honest in everything he did and I think it would have killed his soul she would have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest that that's how much of a stickler he was\nAbout living out this deep deep profound honesty and his integrity really quite stunning\nHow did he get the I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound\nOh well somebody had a couple of getting quite a few things in a number of Jules back he had been a pre teen and then a team as a third\nIn your old he fought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured at Jackson during imprisonment and mouth off to a British soldier\nKicked the sword health is stored can actually beat in Jackson skull I even feel it would Jackson died gulp male could still layer finger in that school creates\nAdd it wouldn't be actually even with the rest of the school that's how deep it was that the kind of being ... would never forget by any means but I'm sure you were thinking\nBy the way I we have very little time but I ... from you was such a scholar folks you really should read this book I Can't wait to read this\nOr is it is it fair to say and totally different with beef it isn't he hated the British more than he hated Indians\nI don't think there's any question about that this ... yeah I just didn't cross Andrew Jackson and because that soldier did that go ahead Jack ... ever after yeah\nThat's what I thought you are a delight and folks the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson scrupulously on us guys you can see the joy to speak to him\nAnd will do it again and go to prayer for Hillsdale ...\nAll right everybody I Am not back home at the studio so I Am not sitting on my

yourself is it worth it\nIt is the ... is the\nEr the rewards whether financial or moral or emotional or or so many others is is it worth it I mean it's not worth it then you have to if possible seek

and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in this chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface pulling an awful way by race in this country\nIs not okay for that to be part of it will cost to Halloween or otherwise\nWhy didn't end there\nBelieve that that's what she did
