protests that ultimately require teammates and referees to separate\nThe two\nProtests founder and now ex NFL or Colin Kaepernick the guy who was the big poster boy for Nike\nNike another major corporation the loads this country and they'll sell that's disgusting we love America if you love America you don't make a poster boy out of the person wouldn't even stand for the national anthem and the flag okay you're full of crap\nDon't live my friends don't lie\nTo yourself still lie to yourself is is this is\nOn every ... every American black white Hispanic Asian who died for this country and for about ...\nIt was All right so just\nJust understand that you you fools Nike\n\nRead was on the forty niners when Kaepernick started the protests and still refuses to stand for the anthem as long held a grudge against\nJenkins for his role and redirecting some of the protest energy into more direct action via a deal with the players coalition which Jenkins cofounded\nJenkins who endorses the cause behind the protests agreed to stop the army field protests if the league would invest about a hundred million dollars into quote unquote social justice causes\nFor that read has labeled Jenkins a sellout\nAs the two teams went out on the field before the game Sunday reading Jenkins began to draw a moment caught on camera things got tense enough that reached teammates have to restrain him\nKaepernick quickly chimed in to express his support\nFor Eric read after the game ... made clear to reporters why he has so much animosity for a fellow NFL player who actually agrees with the larger cause\nJenkins he said as a sellout and a meal colonialist because he co opted the movement by working with the league to raise money for social justice rather than continuing to protest on the field by the way this proves that guys are like read a Lowe's this country\nHe would rather crap on the flag publicly in front of millions then have a hundred million dollars go to causes that he cares for so why does it prove that it proves that his mission\nIs to is to have contempt to show contempt for America that is what it is when you do that\nOkay let's be honest you you will go down to the ground rather than stay standing for the flag and the national anthem\nIs a is only to say I have contempt for that flag and the national anthem that is more important for me than a hundred million dollars to causes that I Would agree with\nThat makes perfect sense that's their cause it stopped pro black their cause is anti America\nThat is true for all of the left the left as I pointed out a thousand times the left around the world loathed America right there is no exception to that liberals are different group\nBut left lobes America always did so you ... if you're an American leftist you would have to argue I agree with the world's left on every single issue except America\nEvery issue\nAn American left to set a French Left instead of Belgium left this to me you're ugly and left this degree on except America oh all of a sudden the left this is no longer a leftist oh I Love America but I agree with everything else on the left to gender\nPlease please don't still don't

transformation\nBoggles the mind\nThat a lot more to talk to you about you're listening to them as Prager show coming from Pittsburgh where everybody goes to\nThe tune\nHistory has made when a leader steps up\nStays true to his values in charge something fundamentally\nWell it's a it's quite a quite something my friends you in Florida listening you've got to vote you got to get everybody to vote\nEspecially if you can't get to the left of bill I mean that doesn't that doesn't exist in in mainstream politics people are hungry for something different [laughter] I Love\nWhat why are you a

it by fellow Americans you don't know how good you have it something different won't be better something different will be worse\n[laughter] [noise]\nBut change right we are the chain draw was the what was that idiotic statement we ought to change that we wanted that ... waited for yes we are the change that we fought does that mean\nWas it changed for the better under Brock Obama was America change for the better run the ... people getting along better is they are less tension in the country\n... there was the economy improves ... under under Brock Obama anywhere comparable to what Donald Trump has done\nThe it's not true to the economy stupid remember that line from the Clinton erupt about true\nNo people are prepared to have a worse economy\nWhen they're most fundamental values are more important than ... than their money and they are mine are so we're left this let's just don't care for America gets impoverished the care that some people get more money than others they care

and\nThe experience was essentially the same in each they've made such an impact\nOn my on me and my wife\nOr to speak correct English on my wife and me\nThat I actually have written my Tuesday column\nComes out tomorrow or sell them on this subject\nWalked among the things that most got to me was the lack of knowledge about cars that they're selling ... among these all all of them young mostly males a\nSales sales people at the if the car dealerships it was it was remarkable\nThis experience with my wife was shopping for an SUV first time I've always just driven a car\nAnd\nAny weight shopping for an SUV and I am very rarely shop for cars because\nFor much of my the last decades I have been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way been whatever it is it I'm now as we're having a new experience to have an ad in a while ago in a car dealers and I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with the Internet I Want to know what to do it with a car dealers [noise]\nWant to give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there were almost all young men with whom I took test drives I think in every instance raw five I think for four or five the fog were young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\n\nSo uh uh as I said at the end I think that if this is an old representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered because hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that SUV can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the lines of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like ... all I could always look it up and the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know anything if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need to know\n\nThis is ... now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do a very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I Am trusting that the lines are working one ape Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n[noise]\nThat was a ... that was one\nAspect of the experience that the hit me there was another one too which is even deeper\nAnd that is that the there was there seemed to be an absence\nOf passion I again I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales folks were passionate about cars\nThat's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these uh sales people get older young I didn't have any sense of that but they were passionate about cars\nIt was it was they might as well have been working at a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people I'm not ... it's not a character challenge it's just the statement\nOf a change that you know if you haven't seen anybody in a long ever seen a young person a long time wow boy did you grow up you really grown because you haven't seen them so you see if you haven't seen something in a long time you can see a\nChange so this was a change that we saw a gentleman who you are just one of these folks ask a technical question our our launch working is what is the story showing you know\nDon't pay any way uh [noise]\nWe'll find out\nThey're not working yeah oh I'm Sorry folks I hate giving you wrong information I was given the information\nBut all the lines are up but they're not up okay these are unfortunate things that I must admit annoying me but you gotta live with it and you gotta live with it and that's the way it works [noise]\nThat's what I saw though there was it was in it and and then I translated that into as well\nThey didn't seem ... you can

I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgraceful turned back Jewish refugees Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist songs and talking about how they're going to transform England us in the U.S in Germany damage I mean that people are mixing up the Jewish refugees in Germany with the German American button you know\nUm these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're they're just living in kind of crappy countries you\nKnow and those countries are crappy for a reason for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad dictatorial political culture from Spain\nUh whereas we inherited a kind of anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and as a result they have worse government worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things [noise]\nThere's a great Latin American economists her and I think his name is ... ...\nA ...
