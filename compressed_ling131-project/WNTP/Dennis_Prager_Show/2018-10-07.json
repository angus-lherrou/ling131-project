here on news talk nine Ninety if you have a question quickly eight seven seven nine nine zero WN to pay eight seven seven nine nine zero nine six eight seven Dr Molly we're talking about pain and how you're\nA innovative medical associates helps people with pain management we did not talk about medical marijuana are very\nVery important you know I don't always talk about it but it's definitely something that we do and it's definitely something that we do in conjunction with the neuro uh the neuro amino acids that we use for pain so\nAgain medical marijuana has a real ... it it has a position in the pain management protocols\nUm we sort of give so factor you know we're probably going to use the yes and it's very interesting because again you have to know how to use the medical marijuana and I will tell folks out there Dr cash gives an expert in that\nSo between the protocols that I've put together\nAnd the medical marijuana we're having great success or or is the patient is actually going on medical marijuana she needed to get a little bit of the hydration in first\nOr we also wanted to do the stem cells first which we have done and now you bring in the medical marijuana peace and I will tell you we expect her pain to go down from a tend to almost one that's what we expect in ...\nAnd I would say that when we're going to keep your our listeners apprised of this because we're very excited about how we put this program together and if people understand that the medical marijuana\nDoesn't interfere it goes to certain receptors the neural amino acids go to the other receptors and indeed we also use a sub clinical dose\nOf a particular antagonist says this is all put together for a particular patient in such a way that these things work synergistic Lee together to get her to that level of thing\nHow do people get medical marijuana law had a bike ride it out or could write prescriptions and New Jersey right now where we can do it in New Jersey and Dr ... yeah she she only approved for medical marijuana but it has to be with under certain conditions correct\nBut pain is one of the anxieties another actually uh we've actually helped an adult child with a two rats and also with um a a certain neurological conditions\nSo it how it would work\nIs the initial consultation you've come in and says some in and then you may recommend that based on your ticket or patient and the Jewish right and then of course you have to get a prescription right but it's not just medical marijuana you have you ... you enhance it with the hydration exactly\nBecause what we found is certain homeopathic\nCertain things work synergistic play with the receptors remember we have CBD receptors in our body what we want to do is work synergistic Lee in our head for this as well as our guts so there are many ways to use this and you want to use it appropriately and I would tell you\nAh we like to call ourselves now the dream team for that\nGuy and I'll tell you I really respect her and I respect her use of the medical\nMarijuana along with what we're doing with the other natural substances and make no doubt about it marijuana is a natural substance each one of ...\nPeople are sometimes concerned about being on something like that forever how does it work\nI think that that's an unrealistic concern it's like saying that you're going to be on a I don't know a water forever it writes unrealistic\nBecause there are many ways to utilize the medical marijuana and it's there are many ways to do it with certain challenges and that's the key get in and get some pain relief\nI Would say that's number one getting let's get some pain relief and then let us improve your quality of life and all the areas you need\nThat that's all well it it's like any other drug

effect on our overall health and now how her glucose ... and this was a natural solution is a way to really get to the uh uh I guess the root cause of pain in the body\nUm before we get into that Dr Janet I'm a I'm going to ask you and I know this is hard for you because this is this is the emotional but I think it's important for people to understand\nHow you got to where you are today or why what what's ... and if you could share that ... it was for it that a lot of personal pain mhm and pain that my\nIt's been had years ago he had a severe osteoarthritis throughout his body at the same time I had five from my house yeah right so I was really on a quest to find something all natural\nTo help him have a better quality of life for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time\nMhm well let let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose I mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on because I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that emu oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right to your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain okay I took a new oil\nAnd glucose ... mhm I use Boswell law which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay we're on the line that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory less than a natural organic sulfur that is also just as important as glucose in Maine\nAnd rebuilding and repairing our joints and salad I put that altogether and ice cream that actually has no odor it's grace list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain and death in irritate you scan goes in Fifteen minutes later you have for a plea and so that's why I'm here\nTo share what I Know and show and a half right has it right\nThen I have this here by the way of folks will cause me cream comes in a plastic dispenser that has pumped top on it at\nThe top ... you'll need one to two pumps depending on the area okay I've painted ... that sanitary in ... so you don't have to worry about it becoming rancid\nOkay now I'm In terms of this getting into your body then you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also made building we read the rebuilding part so how does that work\nOnce you apply the cream to that area that you're going to target ... okay\nYou get the information to go down and the body heal itself\nThe body heal itself provided you give it the raw materials that needs I'm giving you what you made for your body to take over and do the job it was meant to do and that seal okay and this is safe enough and you have to worry about I have to worry about a thing\nThat you're taking drugs for pain it won't conflict with that at all none of these ... going to have

to have a great conversation with you\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly it can be daunting you know with all the different supplements out there not Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this besides the good multi vitamin individual maybe a few other things\nGoing to the three super high nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nWell pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called ... they're a troll and apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigate that they use in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith ... I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with resume or a trial I worked with scientists in Europe and also in California\nSouth Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that green tea\nKirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and always considered super food the green tea fume and there was very ... why do you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other works better you know in a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason pat to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kinda like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and\nThat's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells\nIn our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial in one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know what do you usually been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press and you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity\nAnd have blood to sign on to recap some of these headlines of show me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity\nIs really critical there are many antioxidants\nThat people consume don't actually wind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which are protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nIn addition it has a specific fat oxidation properties that actually burn fat I'm not suggesting that you're going to lose twenty pounds in a week but I Am saying that this is going to help your body to metabolize fat more efficiently\nOver time taking a green tea extract can help you to have a better fat to lean muscle ratio so from a weight control standpoint this is very good news additionally green tea\nHelps to stabilize blood glucose or blood sugar and unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increased wait\nSo by stabilizing blood sugar you have an effect on weight control in weight management so it's really quite remarkable stuff you need enough of it we've got enough of it in green T. C. R. it has to be the right extract when you've got the right to extract but the science is there for healthy weight management\nRight now Chris you see that with surety formula it provides you with about three cups worth of green tea in each to Capitol serving of these cutting edge liquid soft joke so you know the green tea is concentrated benefits for energy for heart health for ... in just too\nSoft gel caps plus you get the Kirk human and the ... too so it's easy you call your daily short cut to better health explain this idea of a healthy short cuts and explain some of the top benefits as well\n[noise] well I mean you could for example drink three cups of good concentrated green tea each day\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor accrued and drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of\nThree of the biggest superstar protective health and Hansing nutrients on the entire planet so when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply\nSaying that you can get in a good liquid soft gelatin capsule what you'd otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine hundred now in this new green T. C. R. formula purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to you I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brain health\nWell I especially like\nThe liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify in Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment so we need a functioning\nSuper healthy very strong liver and we know that hurt him and protect the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps a strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart it's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint we have in numerous ... studies showing overall improvement in joined health and relief\nAnd stable inflammatory activity better joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk him and I like the brain protective studies as well I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind and Kirk human delivers all this so\nI regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware pat but most people are not going to eat\nEnough rock tumor Rick route to get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated curriculum and extract\nChris I don't want to get to technical here but these anti oxygen green tea or classified as police females and there really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists\nBut in his green T. C. R. formula there's more it's got the green tea ... human the spiritual to be talked about flash grape seed extract pine bark bio fibroids vitamin C can you talk to me about this array of really super anti accidents and Polly feels if one of the formula\nOkay we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here grape seed extract in pine bark extract\nBoth contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds that not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels and the skin\nSo we put those in there for extra boost in antioxidant activity additionally\nThe bio flab annoyed and hence the overall activity of vitamin C. and vitamin C itself is one of the most important\nNutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen if we put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C.\nWe realize that we would have an orderly superior formula and just to reiterate pat\nI Want people to experience dynamic health and this formula the green tea the our will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nI ... I Love this green T. C.

and historic downtown McKinney\nA with that little it's a\nLot about these dogs and wherever you are in the country I Know most of your you know a lot of you are not in the Dallas Fort Worth area and so wherever your support your local a rescue organizations there are rescue organizations for every breed imaginable\nOr the SPCA and all of them you know take in probably primarily much mixed breed a animals like a lot of these um that I talk about our\nBut uh we got to at home right now and that's where they came from and they're they're great they're actually getting along better these days one of the things they like to do is choose your own\nWell Nelly the tree climbing dog shocks chew on anything of sticks twigs bamboo\nUm you know you name it but we got him interested in antlers a while back especially her moose handlers are fired she doesn't mind el ... either in there but the ... or the [noise] the favorite\nAnd I got some new and Jeff day and she went crazy is a pretty big one and she went through about a third of it it almost it scares\nYou about how she can chew up stuff and how much of it she swallows nursing bother too much but anyway tighter and her used to really get in fights over them they are both like them they have now decided and I think it was probably\nBy tighter little tighter the old guy or laying down the law about\nHow it was going to work she chews on her wall and then he chews on it does sound like a switch back and forth and it's funny because he doesn't like it until she's cheat on and soften it up a little bit so we always something interesting with\nThe with the dogs\nThough she still climbing trees yeah every now and then she just zipped right across the uh plastic I've been meaning to take the plastic golf and put on to show it extend farther up the tree so it's harder for her to get across but\nIt is easier to get down you say the word tree and she forgets about dogs and birds and things like that\nComes in a behaves pretty oil\nThe T the new to you and it's pretty good by the way it\nIs um is very simple somebody after seeing her newsletter\nOr assume or taught me talk about on the air uh suggested trying this it's

with their uh improvements in the downtown area I'm Glad you all are having the event there\nIt's it's fantastic it's witnesses are twelve here during this conference and the ... my favorite location we've just got were coming to accurate again\nUm because we're right in the old downtown near their stark downtown there's five restaurants on the square that source local nano ... is a large speakers you know we we have ... the shaft you know\nServing lunch at the restaurant then coming over across the street she taught me a give their talks about what they're doing with local source saying it's this integration of local food into the community that's what we're trying to cheat in so many plates at ... and ... really taken huge strides had\nWell it's really moving the right direction in my opinion I don't know um you know I've talked to the people that are running for the commissioner or here in uh Texas we've had both candidates zone and talked about it and in this\nConversation about certified organic programs is a real head scratcher for us because\nWe we really like some of the things about it and all the other hand the government something y'all deal with the law the government interference analog cases is a big problem and I I see more people going organic\nThan than going the certified organic and column themselves certified her y'all seeing a similar kind of\nMovement\nOh absolutely I mean a huge percentage of the people who use organic methods and their farms aren't certified I'm One of them you know we were not satisfied that I did ... years older than ... nationally\nGod be the same way\nAnd I think there's value I mean I think you know when I ... yeah the times I Walk into a grocery store for something that I Can't get at the farmer's market I'll look for organic you know it's just that there's a lot of value to that organic certification particularly they're particularly\nWhen you can't talk to the farmer and to be on it you know the flip side also is you can't assume that everything at a farmer's market it automatically organic stuff that matters\nTo you that every hit that the security is pesticide free you have to get comfortable with asking questions have your farmers and understanding it I mean that's another big piece we're doing at the conference we've got a ... a couple of sessions early on different\nAngles of understanding your food and what was he labeled me what do you know how do you find good food what's the important how do you prioritize you know 'cause it's confusing\nI I live and breathe that stuff and I get confused by it sometimes\nYeah well you know one of the things that we have a problem with the certified programs that are out there is that when\nYou you go to a government agency and so you want to be certified you in most cases you have to go through a three year program of being offered the hosts the sides and synthetic fertilizers right [noise] yeah\nThey don't talk anything about the health of the oil [laughter] only talk stop using certain things they don't talk much about what you should do to kick the biological activity up\nAnd have this richness in the soil going into the food which is what it's all about everything we talk about here and that's why a lot of people that are out there that that aren't certified or doing a great job because they understand that basic philosophy that it's all about the soil\nEat of the government folks even even the batter intentioned ones and there's a whole range but even though it's with contentious for the most part literally just don't get it and I mean they don't understand it and we see this you know in the ... so you know people will see these headlines saying you know organic says no better for you here's a study you know and\nI you know or they see the research that says organics we can't feed the world people would start by the millions if we did organics\nAs because when the research universities do their study it's what they do is they take soil but it has been abused for\nSeveral decades sometimes and they stop eating the pesticides\nAnd herbicides and maybe they do a cover crop\nOr they do some compost started you know they do something and they do it for a year or two ... and the crowd that comes out of there is pathetic\nWell of course it is [laughter] you you butchers this whole and and you sort of give it to this little trickle of extra nutrition you think it's going to be finding a year or two\nA lot of them they bad since I started doing the show there was a when I was a deal on the radio station\nFor a while the the one of the guys the helicopter pilot that the the Trevor gr board he said the images Amy one does it ... really what did you try he said well Baltimore you bugging them put them out no just all over what\n[laughter] you know you did yeah Dick you do [laughter] the\nGuy but he was um he does not quite get what I was trying to uh teach\nYou know and that's the caliber
