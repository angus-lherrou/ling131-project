Donald Trump is now presidential his his last flaws we're still make some data foolish tweed here or there but he's ... his last four years conquering\nGene he really he he has a\nMastery of the domestic and international situation believe it or not and I was surprised as anyone I did not expect it at all\nBut that's the case\nAs I told twelve hundred nearly old Jews in LA last week by the way that talk is up on the Internet it's not on our website up but people should watch it\nFrom the left and the Jews and it said that the largest the synagogue west of the Mississippi Valley pressure alone in\nLos Angeles I'm Sorry largest conservative yeah that's right the three branches conservative performing an orthodox right largest conservative so you could just put in Dennis Prager and valley Beth Shalom and you'll you'll get the talk\nAnd but the uh the group was the Republican Jewish alliance is that correct is that the correct the exact same yeah or or do that way but it it it doesn't matter if you're a Jew or not the it's the talk\nWill be illuminating and\nIt's\nA I said the reason that the talk came to mind as I said at the beginning of the talk as of this moment anything can happen of course but as of this moment this president's is a great president\n\nAnd he is he's a great praise be not only beyond expectations cheese he's done more for what I value and others who are not on the left value including liberals but they don't know it because they've been so intimidated their whole lives into believing the right as the enemy\nBut as Alan Dershowitz or the left is the enemy of liberalism and I have said that over and over watch my video five minutes ... minutes differences between left Marymount lost twice already between liberal and what\nAbout the prayer you does come plus the video this week okay health care\nWhat's wrong with government rather watch wrong with the government or own healthcare God as a timely\n\n\nFlowers there a battle so it turns out I was right there was a civil war in the United states even the left now acknowledges if they're writing about it that's correct but as I said most of my life only one side was fighting\nNow it may may be maybe capital was the final straw ... baby while I reported last hour is the final straw\nA a a male winning the female bicyclists bicycle competition\nBut the male is a transgender woman she she identifies this person identifies as a female with a male body and no testosterone rules the but\nThen the the the runners up from the Netherlands and the United states showed up on the platform they should live on behalf of women and fairness they shouldn't have showed up what people are and fighters\nI'm not blaming those women\nThey're probably not probably show intimidated by the left the ... the day you are no longer intimidated by the left to ask Dave Ruben they Rubin's gay liberal and\nHe is a he he understands the left see HIS Video while left the left social pressure you\n\nIf you're a liberal who thinks that the left is your ally you have been brainwashed there was no rational pop there's no possible rational reasons it's purely an emotional decision\n[noise]\nWhat's going to be the final straw to have people say that the left is it an elderly destructive force any one of these things the Capitol hearing\nThe the ... the defamation of a good man by the Democratic party by the way\nThings happened so fast that is amazing fish it's so amazing how fast I predict that in my column that I wrote on the Capitol hearing now they'll go to elementary school and sure enough that\nOr people see height but it doesn't matter people see\nShoe size I mean people see a lot of things so when they say they don't see they they really mean what Mary Ann said we mean it is astonishing that your kids are learning to honor race and ethnicity on her that's that's the term that that is what they're taught\nIt do you understand how backwards left ism is how morally backwards it's a decline in civilization the American experiment that we're all American out of many one\nVats progressive what they have what they advocate that is regressive [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAh Zack in ... in Illinois thank you for calling [noise]\nHello Zack [noise] but he's not phone day to me it's not a good phone they have to say [noise] okay sorry\nGot

amazing there it is\nOkay stand Detroit Michigan hello Stan\nRecord Dennis or questions for yourself you can help us here in the city the breakdown why all of a sudden in Maine where Churchill it's derogatory this astronaut Scott Kelly\nTweeted a whole above Winston Churchill later on and you mentioned parties last week about ... what kind of self esteem like you're going to backtrack a corporate Winston Churchill yet a product that is very I don't support recesses break like\nThe way I Want to look this up I'm not familiar with that who who tweeted which Churchill who ah\nScott Kelly former astronaut astronaut\nOkay All right those are the thank you for telling me about it I'm gonna look it up that reminds me what was the movie this weekend that that didn't have the American flag uh [laughter] they ... the first man ... it's a movie about\nThe the American flight to the moon ... one of the central moments was planting the American flag on the moon and it's not in the movie\nIt gives you an idea of the the way in which Hollywood generally loads this country because they're on the left all of the left on earth load the America the American left is no different American liberals love America the American left\nThat's contempt for America\nAnd that's a perfect example why would you remove the scene of the planting of the American flag when you are making a movie about Americans going to the mood\nFor the same reason that the left wing writers of Superman had Superman renounce his American citizenship about five years ago\n\nWhat do they have to do to prove to you may have contempt for this country\n\nYes first ma'am yes that was a was David\n\nWhat do they have to do this is my question there apparently\nFor liberals ... liberals have nothing in common with the left except hatred of the rights and a big government everything else the liberalism is the antithesis so you have to drop the hatred of the right to brainwash you should be hating the left\nThe left has contempt for every liberal value\n\nBut with regard to America let's fundamentally transform the United states of America but we love it\nBecause I've asked for about two decades\nIf your husband wants to fundamentally transform don't you think he'd love you\nHow do you how can you how can you have both at the same\nTime we are we have\nGood give me the the Obama ...

I'm convinced America to no longer maintain an isolationist stance and we'd have an American astronauts apologizing for Winston Churchill and his helping to save the Judeo Christian civilization ... these are the stakes\nInvolved in in next month's election Dennis\nMiller Caribbean divide the way I I tend not to ... I almost never make her prognosis and I'm not making one now but would you do you feel comfortable and making ... what do you think will happen\n[noise] um I I don't do 'em predictions but I I listen to those\nWho have a very good track record\nOf it are very few so President Trump's victory in sixteen but one of them was Larry Schweich up um and and I've been texting back and forth to Larry Larry says not only do we gain seats in the Senate we may gain seats in the house is Larry Larry ... is is is optimistic\n... does\nLook at what happened in sixteen\nThe mainstream said Hillary has it in the cat and a new times Huffington Post said Ninety five percent chance of victory and what happened a silent majority trounced or\nIn the last year and a half how could it\nPossibly be but the silent majority hasn't grown just for economic reasons alone let alone the fact that looked at the statistics of African Americans approval rating of the president has doubled in just the last year so how could the result will be better I find that hard to imagine all\nThe uh what I I heard about the black Americans vote was a ... a heat he may get a about twenty five percent which is that where the case that would end any democratic chances\nYeah if if I've seen figures as up to ... percent uh it's it's stunning and indeed what happened last week with Kanye in in the White House and how the quote unquote mainstream media\nCame out of the woodshed and its most bigoted hateful fire shell minstrel\nShow event juvenile equipped for why you need to grow yes and the new life doesn't\nRead rifles he puts on a red might have looked for institutionalized racism and you'll find it on the left today\nThat that is exactly right so right now\nDo you think this is by sixty four thousand dollar question and I I ask that last hour of my listeners\nDo you believe and I and I'll have to ask you was I asked myself no wishful thinking here okay if not what we know hey All right not what we want but what do you think\nDo you believe that there will be or we have reached a tipping point where the left will simply do something so egregious I think the capital humans would be that example but others would differ\nBut do you believe we have hit one or two we'll get one or will never hit one that is the proverbial lobster or frog being boiled who doesn't even though he's being boiled alive what do you think\nI think it's already happened I think the fact that we don't talk about James Hodgkinson every single day and that most American have most Americans have no idea who James Hodgkinson is\nLet's remember that the Steve ... was almost killed by a man who took a rifle in my hand guns to a Republican ... baseball practice session\nBut when he was killed by those three brave kept to police officers what did they find on his body they found a hit list\nThey list of solely Republican congressmen that this individual was going to assassinate its stomach that you know we forget all the people who are on that field\nFried butter on ... so maybe my question wasn't clear I Know that there will be individuals who were tipped over right is there a point where Americans\nNon left wing Americans yeah we'll have their tipping point and say oh oh oh the last ... really is dangerous\nOh it's happened I think it's happened and I don't think it's ritual thinking I just look at the social media and in the last three weeks of the capital hiring I I was in Manhattan last week for the for the launch of why we fight\nAnd an older couple recognize me as I was waiting to get on the train back to D.C\nAnd they came up to me and they said we just quite people living our lives in in in Trenton New Jersey but we've had enough where we're going to vote we're going to support down ticket Republicans because what they did tobacco godly man ... absolutely right just individual was truly\nFilthy and disgusting so yes I think we have reached the tipping point when you have you know set it to like Feinstein like book or like a Kamala Harris impugn the reputation of a man who\nWho is white as the driven snow I think we've already arrived us\nWell they would say yes that's the problem is wider than the driven snow that's how sick it's become that that that's probably a a a a phrase that will be renounced but yes so you think sorry so I Want to get this\nClear you think that that I Do too I think that for a not for all Americans but for a very significant numbers that Kavanaugh hearings worth tipping point to say the left and the Democrats have gone too far so that it that is your position\nIf you if you're on on the millennial who's sitting in some ivory tower and being brainwashed every day if you're just an average American and you look at the first five minutes of the Kavanaugh hearing\nYou had enough I mean ... that was righteous indignation power excellence and I think that's the capitalist\nWell that's the hope that I so want to fight to ask you this prior to the cabin or hearing do you think that there was a tipping point before or you really do believe that's the key one\nNo I I didn't I didn't see before eyes\nWhile so this is dramatic to you what happened\nOh my gosh look this is I think it's in the last chapter in my book it's wicked chambers and I I didn't know what was going to happen with Kavanaugh but afterwards I said my gosh we need to wake up because this is a new mission shock anybody this isn't just blow this isn't just\nParents tapas they've been doing the left has been doing this since Nineteen food\nRight hey what you're saying is America out there are millions of Whittaker Chambers right now about waking up\nYeah OK from your mouth to God's Ears anyway from your from his pen to your mind Sebastian Gorka as book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies it as often\nDennis Prager dot com we continue the Dennis Craig or show\nThe list this president I'll tell you another thing that the capital a hearing revealed to be although I wasn't surprised this was not a revelation but\nThe confirmation I should say more than anything else and this will really shocked a lot of people who loads of man I think he has a good horse Donald Trump yes\nI can attest to this is what Dr phil left insane and they will never believe it whether it's\nInviting the survivors the victims of the Parkland shooting to the west wing to talk to them or whether it's holding the hand of that that an African American grandmother whose son had been killed\nA very vicious who he is and the shocking thing I can tell you because I worked for him and I you know I write down the influences and and why we fight us the evidence of this he or she is\nPassionate to you as an

pretty self recommending but I I have been saying for years\nAnd I think I was one of the first and I'm not saying this to brag I'm ...
