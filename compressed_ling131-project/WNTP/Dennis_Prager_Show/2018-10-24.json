I'm Dennis Prager and this is the male female our\nEvery Wednesday the second hour of my show was devoted to what I Believe it's the most of us to talk about men and women in the media at this time\nAnd as I often point out if it is not the most honest then I salute those who are more angst I I totally prepared to be in second place on this\nBut I I don't know where that might be found at this time and the reason is I don't have a male gender agenda or female agenda another man fan ... fan I'm a good people fan\nAnd there are just as many good man is good women and just as many awful ... ... that's just the way it is it's almost perfectly apportioned\nFor every foolish man there is a foolish woman and vice versa for every good man there was a good woman by and large by and large if some societies you will find more of one type and the other I think\nBut any in any event good people don't grow on trees whether male or female my topic today\nIs the column that I Britain this week and it is largely about young men and the question of ambition\nOne of the things that renders men mass killing in the eyes of women or at least that was the case for all of history and I am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that perhaps for young women today it is not the case I Would love to get your input on that particular issue incidentally but\nBy and large one of the most appealing traits if I may say ... renders a man sexy if it's one of the things to a woman is ambition knocked\nCrazed ambitious miss narcissism no ambition I wanted to get ahead I Want to be successful\nAnd ambition for all of western recorded history\nWas largely I Wish to succeed at work and I wish to provide for a wife and children I Wish to provide for a family\nVicious white male ambition this is when I was certainly when I was a kid this was what was assumed it was so so much of a given it wasn't even articulate it because it was just assumed\nWill you grow up and be able to take care of a family that was male ambition\nAnd uh my sense is that that has been a killed for many young men because it has been killed\nIn the society the notion of raising men boys to be men first of all is it believe it or not is almost\nConsidered archaic today a be a man that that is so sexist be a man or that is so patriarchal or some other ... unbelievably destructive adjective useful\nThing for a boy to aspire to be a man what is a man a man takes care of the family\nThat is the primaries up the only thing that constitutes a man obviously but it is for most males that has been the defining element cat will I take care in all senses of the word we'll like take care of a family\nSo my assumption today is that this ambition has been shot first of all a lot of men for my generation to today even more so today\nOh we're taught that hey you don't have to take care of a family in fact you don't even have to have a family there's no real compelling reason for you to get married and if you do\nThe female will pull her weight as they say she will row her or just as much as you rode your or you were all a boat with two\nAs men and so the notion that that I as a male will need to take care of a family is is considered again the patriarchal an archaic do you agree that's my question do you think that the the man of ambition\nI I Wish to get ahead I Wish to succeed uh I Wish to take care of a family that this is an endangered species I obviously acknowledge that they\nThis they exist even in significant numbers but I'm the question is proportion so if you especially if you are a woman or she will have a daughter who is dating\nOr do you have a sense that this is taking place\nThat one I have described is in fact what is taking place or a this is an alarm that is not worthy of being sounded because it's not a big deal one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThese are the numbers to talk to me if you are dating if you have a son you might have a son for example who is not particularly ambitious who was a more than happy to stay at home and uh you know make a living but not not not really aspire to more I had the sense as I told you\nHours I mentioned I didn't tell you I mean it I mean lanes but it's my column this week is about\nMy wife and my experience is test driving vehicles last week at five different dealers and the Los Angeles area\nAnd my sense and they were all wonderful people are there was this news no knocked on them but my sense was that\nThese were not guys who were particularly ambitious particularly passionate about their work and you could say well maybe they're not passionate about selling cars yeah but it doesn't matter you still have to be passionate about your work even if you don't care about the particulars\nBecause the the more that you're passionate about your work the more successful you'll be and the more you will rise in life\nOr my father wanted to be a doctor\nJust couldn't afford medical school so became an accountant he became extremely passionate about accounting which is about is far from being a doctor is you can get but he just decided to his great credit I'm going to become passionate about my work I've always ... do well at it\nSo the question on the table is ... young males and ambition\nNow overly ambitious is not good overly anything it is good to exercise it's not good to be addicted to marathons I mean there's there's no end in life to the to the\nFact that any good things can be over done\nSo I understand you can have too much ambition because then it's not ambition to take care of a family and and ambition to do good it's ambition to be to be super rich or to be super famous or to be super powerful and that's not a that is not admirable that's not what I'm Talking about\nBut the absence of ambition in men is in a mask you leading\nCharacteristic\nThey major part of masculinity is indeed ambition I Want to succeed and wants to take care of I Want to take care of and I want to take care of\nThat's a good thing and it and and in the past it has rendered men desirable to a woman\nBut I I Believe that society has played the terrible trick on both young men and young women who have told them that they are at the same it's told young women that they are sexually the same as men\nThey could enjoy any number of hookups just as much as men can with no emotional price paid and now why do you think why do you think that this idiocy of a rape culture charge at colleges exists why do you think that exists it exist because so many young women have had sex that they later regretted\nSo rather than saying you know why did I get into it they prefer to use the term rape culture\nThat's that's the genesis of the a phony charges of rape culture and it's by the way this proves that it's phony the proof is that parents and their daughters to college\nNo no parent in the world would send the door to door rape culture I mean what are we always joking but we ... what what are we living in the New York times\n\nAnd they told by the same thing you know you know you know women women will carry half their weight in any in any deal and not by the way guys you don't have to get married you know what's\nWhat's in it for you divorce is a fortune anyway there's nothing in it for you you know women are available\nAnd so that doesn't breed the type of man that a fair number of women would want for a mate [noise]\nThat's my theory if I'm wrong I'm happy I'm wrong [noise]\nI Would like to be wrong male female our I'm Dennis Prager\nKnow well that is that as an exceptional teacher and part of the reason I Am convinced is it South Carolina and it is not LA New York Chicago et cetera [noise]\nThat's a powerful story I wrote it down and I think you and Michelle San Diego California Dennis Prager Hi\nHi how are you at well thanks so we hear\nMy intellectual here our ally great for taking my call so now I think that today I rarely come I think that's ... ... and raise children with that woman studying for minor I taught a college that men and women are very excited\nAnd then I got married and had cats and I can tell and you know that that's not true\nAnd I think that is because\nIt had a baby so stay home and take care of the family will make money and that's why the maker isn't really motivated to which it harder now than it used to be\nA and then everything is okay now we have encountered that low household\nSo they're not being raised by I'm not sure who are boys and girls after school programs and I think everybody live as\nWell I I think that that's to a large extent except when you know obviously quite wealthy homes could afford a on a few manny's or at least one and you know it can work but for the great majority of people I don't think it has worth particularly well\nI thank you for that and the Caleb in Cleveland Hi\nCaleb in Europe like Germany on Yes sir thank you for calling it\nA I just wanted to say

but like I don't want to until I'm able to support a family\nYou don't have to agree with you by the way I I don't I don't understand since you want to support a family and since you both have to live on on some income at this point I don't I never ... I literally have never understood the notion I won't marry until I couldn't afford to\nShow we stay on with me cause I admire you tremendously for your attitude but I don't understand this assumption is that you only get married when you're financially capable\nOf taking care of the other person the other person\nCan also go for\nHelp take care of herself in the meantime as she is right now [noise]\nBack in the moment the dentist Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nNews dog nine Ninety\n[noise] with us or a news ... news in Washington the FBI is activated his joint terrorism task force to investigate a pipe bomb and at least two suspicious packages and it's probably the Democrats and to CNN those packages riding a\nPresident former president bronco Obama's home as well as the Clintons Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince has called the killing of drunk the show veep a heinous crime but cannot be justified the crown prince ... said the killing of the Washington Post columnist will not drive a wedge between\nThe kingdom that he runs in Turkey is comments today stressed the long standing relationship between those two nations\nDoesn't child has died following the survival outbreak at a New Jersey rehabilitation center that brings the death toll there to serve in the state health department says there been Eighteen cases overall the a dino virus that nursing and rehabilitation center in ...

twenty twenties who knows\n[noise] any way mum wherever you are and I believe you are somewhere happy birthday from me from your baby [noise]\nAll right everybody how to make America America again elect Democrats and win back the house or the Senate the emotional basis of left wing sauce is\nSomething I've been pointing out my whole life Thomas Friedman is a perfect example of it like to read the program and and he is considered one of these awful liberals he's not even\nDoesn't call himself a West is but he hates the president and Mrs they hate the president to president represents everything they load the people who vote for them or lower some were deplorable\nWe are the opposite of Tom Friedman we are or it's just the fact we lived differently or we uh many of us are religious many of\nUs uh uh like guns remembered that cling to religion and guns\nOr many of us are to actually get the chills that the star Spangled Banner many of us think of this only contemptible to ah purposely meal in front of a hundreds of thousands of people rather than stand for the national anthem\nMany of us think that the United states is the greatest force for good many of us think that it's the least racist country in the history of the world many of us think we are blessed to be American so where we were different than if you guys are in the Tom treatments world\nBut I like to I'd like to read to you because he is one of their more eloquent spokesmen he knows how to use the language so I I I don't I don't want to use a\nA bad example but the best example that the left has so Thomas Friedman the today's New York times okay it's titled how to make America America again elect Democrats\nNow the very notion that you're going to make America America and abide electing a left wing party is is in itself and absurdity\nThe left wing all over the world which is to do with the American revolution and to preserve the French Revolution every to get to South Africa for a moment to show the America will be made America Again by having by having Democrats are in power\nTo have a more than ... a far more socialized economy as an example really All right so let's take some of the things he says some of the things he doesn't talk about\nThe begins what is their left to say about the terrible murder or moderate Saudi journalist ... and its aftermath by the way I don't know if he was moderate or not and I don't know if it's relevant if if the guy was moderator not moderate\nOr what was done to him is disgusting we all agree on that one of the few things left there I couldn't agree with only one thing and I said it before but I feel it even more strongly now in the mid term elections vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for Democrats\n[noise] why does this have to do a well we'll we'll find out what this has to do with ... then he writes I don't say that because I'm particularly liberal\nOh really you're not particularly liberal\nFascinating is that why would you you're not even particularly liberal you you're not let alone left is you're not even particularly liberal Tom Friedman but you want people to vote for Democrats campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for Democrats\nSo you want the left wing party to win but you're not particularly liberal\nOkay I just want you all to follow the logic here and walk to shift the whole country the liberal agenda I say that because I'm particularly American I Want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy and politics really the best of American values\nAnd and uh was was that it was that for example on display or when the when the rock Obama pulled out of Iraq\nWas that the best of American values and international policy was the shipping of billions of dollars to the Iranian regime\nWhich is worse W. O. R. S. E. then the Saudi regime in terms of doing evil on the face of the earth evil means hurting people in case it meets a definition\nThis is not a religious terms specifically it it's not a complex term evil is the greater amount of hurt that is done to innocent people\nIs greater amount of hurt them to innocent people by Iran or Saudi Arabia the enemy of\nSaudi of the enemy of Iran is\nHere Mr Friedman so if you really care about humanity why wouldn't you while we all recognize how primitive the Saudi regime is and\nAnd it's institutions nevertheless I don't have a choice between a wonderful place and he ... I have a choice between Saudi Arabia and Iran just as\nIn World War two we had a choice between Stalin and Hitler and weak correctly chokes Stalin who even killed more people okay that's that's why I don't know what you mean by put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics\nBut he'll explain his way I Will continue with his worth analyzing\nBecause we need to understand how the best of our opponents think and then respond you're listening to the dentist Prager show the dentist Springer show\n\nJust to bully trumping Republicans the same way he has them oh your poor bully people but I'll take that chance because there was a basic respect for truth science and decency in the Democratic caucus you gotta be kidding\n\nTo people to deny that there was male and female in the human being they have a respect for science\nYou're You're Joking correct truth truth\nUniversities are committed to truth left ones the university's Tom Friedman is there a commitment the truth their decency\nWho who who\nDecency after what the democratic caucus did to Brett Kavanaugh decency you have you had the temerity Tom Friedman\nYou speak about the Democratic party and decency the left and decency\nAfter after the the ... Republican after Republican who was gotten punched while campaigning gotten shop while campaigning for ... and the others were shot at a Wal playing baseball sorry not campaigning\nAnd what about ... and all of the all the Republicans who have dinner and people scream obscenities in their face and you talk to me about who's more decent\nGod I was living in a very very wonderful a power away from reality\nWhat else is he saying I Know the two more years of the GOP holding every lever power blindly following Trump's basic disrespect for true science of decency there we go again\nTo see it is so fascinating they they they throw out these gigantic charges I it's all generalized and general wants to give you specific I just gave you a specific for every example\nWho's who's been more indecent Republicans or Democrats in the last two years\n[noise] truth without power today is just background background moved back ... to the march of the Trump Administration you see I can write that it's vitally important for global stability in the protection of journalists everywhere that those who executed and ordered the murder of cars show you'd be punished\nReally it's vitally important for global stability\n\nI think they have to be punished I couldn't agree more on moral grounds for a global stability\nWhen was the what did he write about the the ... need to punish of the Iranian regime for what it does to journalists I was just reading a report about the rape centers in ah in in Iran for women caught up were anti regime\nI missed out on a ...
