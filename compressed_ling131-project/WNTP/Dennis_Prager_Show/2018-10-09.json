our\nI\n... to having a map and you know exactly where you are but do you have no idea where you're supposed to be going\nThe ultimate issues our is about where we're going about about the map of where we are although that the to wake us\nToday is going to be a little more political than most are not in the sense of direct politics but the subject has political correct political ramifications I have a I have a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\nOr better\nMaybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to pose and by my earlier statement that said realization you'll have in my view of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nDo people prefer\nLiberty or to be taken care of\n\nSo you know might you know my answer even if you have never heard before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nAnd not be taken care of them have to take care of themselves now obviously up to the extreme that you you can find a doctor you can't find the hospital you can find a policemen obviously there's [noise]\nWe're talking about within certain bounds\n[noise] but\nUh that is how that is how people think\nI Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assumes for what am I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that that was in a chord with the human the universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it do you know the\nNew York times are you ready I'm telling you this is going to shock you shock you in terms of its stupidity as much as in terms of its politics the New York times had an op ed piece in the last few days\nI did not mention it but I read it and\nI have to clean it up I mean there wasn't it wasn't that all profane but you know kids listen to this am I Am aware of that that but also put it in a very general way and somewhat opaque adults will understand\nIt was an article about women who had lived under communism and then lived under freedom so it was East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down and they mail had freedom no longer living under communism the article was a serious article you must understand the soups model lampooned is not from the onion it was a serious article claiming\nThat women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany\nHad a more fulfilling sex life than women in a West Germany\n\nYou read that correct about the argument was they were so taken care of that the absence of the freedom to even speak did not trouble them as much as they felt rewarded by all the benefits of a communist state\n... by the way a series of articles in the New York times about how life in less free societies can be better\n\nSo then there was another article just the let's see what today Wall Street journal what's ... give up for free money\n\nI moved to sway even for a love not money\nBut I was happy to learn that merely living in this social democracy also in title me the paid parental leave benefits who couldn't object to free money handed out by the government to all Swedish parents then I became a father\nAnd he talks about the you know everything free health care subsidized housing paid leave on employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of inter laced welfare programs is the government to attempt to realize the political and social ideal that has seemingly universal acceptance among Swedes that has noticed the kit\nT.
