D. being dead gum [noise]\nMark Hasse they're packed with you again filling in for Dennis Prager in my second decade\nOf doing this it has been a real privilege you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on their next on my Web page at the ... show dot com where you can email me Solomon Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that we can perhaps respond to on the air\nAs always you can keep in touch with me I mentioned this specifically the whole the mail mark ... dot com M. A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. A. O. L. dot com which many of you've done over the years and I really appreciate that fact\nHave you checked their side she'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer or Larry Elder as I did last praying for what a privilege to be able to fill in for both the gentleman\nAlthough I must admit I intentionally used Facebook and Twitter much less now I don't think I ever barely touched Twitter anymore you know how far left and biased they are that Facebook has its own thing with you know you get in touch with people you have known for years or seen fears or heard from but\nI don't know I mean it's so clear what side of the spectrum there on and that makes a difference\n[noise] but in the news you add to have heard about the ... murders at a Pittsburgh synagogue\nAnd it's hard to imagine that you go pray and be with your God and your fellow worshipers and you were murdered surely the cause of your face\nAnd it's just incredible not unlike when you go to your church and you were murdered purely because of your skin color or you were threatened or attempted murder is committed because of your political persuasion they all have one thing in common\nThey make no sense except when you understand there's evil in the world committed by evil and deranged people [noise] that\nPeople are not born good and listen to seems to be a battle with those who are I don't know religious from those of us who are secular\nAnd if people are left to their own devices can commit terrible crimes\nAs with genocide or slavery so from the very beginning you write we teach our children that you know not every toys their talking I always love it when you go to a party and um it's your kids or someone else's birth to part of the kid goes and do your kids watch every toy that the birthday kid has\nBecause they haven't been taught right they grow up selfish everything is about them when they're babies everybody's a doting on them and falling all over them so that's a key difference certainly between\nI think not only the religious and secular but the left and the rights of people are not basically good cause you hear all the time with the less that oh you know you got to be understanding of the murder or you got to be understanding of that background and stuff oh yeah the there's a real issue about whether the people would be good if left to their own devices and\nWhat a dentist always called something about the Germans tribes I think in Eighteenth century\nOr they were so powerful and committed such evil and that the answer was because they could\n[noise] so it's important to have a guardrail were good behaviors are defined and bad behaviors are outlawed outlawed or even more importantly prohibited by by a garbage will have to answer to that\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the price to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people want to go you know he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so lock her up is not by any means and incitement to violence\nThe other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially annoyed with the charge that they are the enemy the people there be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they're beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate the press not infrequently comes out was stores that are not true the latest example that you hear this one NBC was hiding spoke tore evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's it's a cute one it's a good what it seems NBC knew that you did they even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John\nI think I got something on Johnny didn't hear that bit of news yeah this so called serious offense is not outraged if the exam and it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters\nTo media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so they're no longer object to reporters and a part of sense of the left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy does to the detriment of insurance so for example out talk about on the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mention the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone is guilty of a crime catch this their children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father\nHow come that hardly ever reported by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she was on Fox News even though he more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lack the proper documents to come to this country or your house or at your bank account they just don't have the right documents so of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports and so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people\nAnd not allowing them to make their own decisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the ship these right\nLet me know what you're saying one a predator seven seven sex mark guys from the dentist for\nNine Ninety intelligent conservative talk\n[noise] whatever\nNews I bought I knew

shootings at the temple and and then it kind of evolved into a\nPeople blaming certainly the media and of course the Democrats in the left is all the same thing these days blaming President Trump for the pipe bomb or bomber blaming President Trump for the shootings at the temple it never ceases to amaze me that everything that goes on that's bad it's his fault\nAnd um even in the most serious charges against and the one I think that most if ended up being the press\nIs that the people that that depression is the enemy of the people which I think they are because they don't report the news objectively and that was basic to our founding that they'd be a free press a new reporting the facts and not giving into government figures that they agreed with and make\nIt easier like they did on President Obama and by the way speaking of President Obama he said some awful things to that could incite people like me normally ... matter people like make sure that we have that clip let's play me\nDoes that you don't punish political\n\nHow radical Republican [laughter]\nWe don't target people based on how\n\n[noise] I'm not now but I'm not going to hurt right now [noise] I don't want\nImmigrant children from their mother\n\nAnd\nSo why isn't bad inciting people to violence did you see how he said so passionately and in the anger and his voice as that ... people on my side let alone President Trump that were against people based on how they look or how they pray daily\nWhen did that first happened I didn't I must have missed that or when he was looking for the compassionate Republicans right he really needs to Republicans that don't stand up for themselves but I Love the last one because I was going to talk about illegal immigration in this hour\nRipping immigrant children not no it's not illegal immigrants but we're thing immigrant children\nAnd and talking about from the cold spell ripping them out of the arms the mothers or fathers and and you know however you put a I'm paraphrasing\nAnd they wind up in a in a coal sell how isn't that incitement on his side for somebody but yeah you do that or to children away from their parents we better do something about how come when he knows that it's OK how come when he he actually is lying about our position\nWhere as President Trump blind I Want you to point that out in terms of\nBank immigrant children from their mother\nLeaving them in a coal sell cars that makes me pretty angry how come it's not on their side\nThat that's OK when they do but it's only President Trump you see the visceral\nHatred for this president and as I mentioned Larry show friday you know the reason for it\nIs because we finally have a Republican who standing up to the other side who doesn't let them get away with anything look like you I'm not I'm not thrilled with everything he says there's Denis says you get the total package\nWith everybody but the fact is they hate him to hate him with a passion because\nFinally someone standing up to them that's what I think someone is really not letting them get away with it remember John McCain to do anything about personal balmy he didn't want people to even mention the fact that he may have been you know the way he talked about the America should I Apologize\nAnd I've you know the issue about where he was born I get that one but you can't say anything about President Obama that was ... religious so to speak\nBut it's okay you can do anything you want to say about President Trump is okay\nAnd the press is complicit with this so yeah\nOn my side you can't say anything but on the other side you could do what you want\nAnd it was very hard I got to tell you it was very hard for me is the last quarter last hour said even some Jewish leaders or I shouldn't say even what a surprise most of them are on the left to say oh the climate from the top down\nThat's what you're doing that's what's creating madman well let me tell you if I was a little over the edge what President Obama did could maybe if I was a crazy evil person may be pushed me over the edge\nHow can you compare that I'm Mark ...\nSay that a person bomb was just this great guy right like he never lied he never set up a straw ... like you said an immigrant children it's not immigrant children and how come it's not mentioned that when people go to jail their kids are taken away from them because people don't want you to know that you don't want to have that kind of ...\nLet me know what you think when a predator seven seven six I'm hearing it live and the pain

want to make a comment and a response to the previous caller and I'm often looked like she said people get up from the Jewish community and say that that that they are opposed to the president has

resistant to it\nWe're opening our borders to people who are very sick they are some of them are like typhoid Mary show no symptoms\nThey'll carry that disease here and public health can handle that it's a huge number of people that go directly into the population\nYou are at risk your kids are at risk and this is a public health problem\nGreat ... threatened\nTo overwhelm the country and like I Know I've heard you know President Obama you know if you want your doctor you can keep your doctor I mean he sounds great but the fact is we got screwed on health insurance because of him and like if somebody says a good thing that's that's great but where's the beef\nShow me the the proud of what's going to happen in\nPublic health is nothing to mess around with their the people that stand for you in the middle of your community and President Trump is right we have a crisis on our border\nAnd people don't even know about it I call the Chicago Tribune which is just purchased by another

kids were concerned about our\nFamilies and if we find now that somebody's been holding back information that we needed and didn't get because the press didn't tell us didn't think it was important

A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com [noise]\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis Springer course I differ Larry Elder last friday [laughter]\nIs this how are you can continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I walked and talked about illegal immigration especially with the caravan\nApproaching I've talked about illegal immigration for over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you acknowledge the simple fact\nThat people across the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out which one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you knowledge they're coming here legally the argument might be quickly over\nIf there are legal then they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you want to hold and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walked into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove that the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase on document as if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said that the left as one of the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change or whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit of course that helps to have a media on your side perpetuating this whole such so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the office\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work and President Trump and Republicans accused you heard President Obama and last hour we had the clip them him of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in cold cages\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration [noise]\nHe has more I mean but would be the right word but anybody I Know President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes but the left and the Democrats and the media often the same thing I Do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believed in open borders but they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms never mind that when anyone does something illegal and they hold off to jail they'll their children do not go with them to jail they're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd it all in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading to the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nThat was no doubt my my name is Thirteen and other people who would do us harm or among them so again President Trump to Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show you crying children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets into our country or a house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right to protect the American people from arm where the from terrorism or as one caller mentioned last hour disease or even for that matter to make sure that people come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico\nSome of us think this is so obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense I mention it last hour the Democrats won more votes and the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know\nSo you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote when he ran in Texas wonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA loss in politics is sixty to forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption most of the ... illegal immigrants come here for jobs as we've long established but they also take advantage of government handouts that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering better give it up\nSo here's the phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats they always choose the real thing\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again so even even on a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it was clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody [noise]\nWhat do you say to people around the world who've been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and in ... and she bought a national paperwork even have a chance of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those are dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one color on a different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggest that border walls don't work in the long run\nBut even if that were true I told them I bet they worked in the short run to stop mass of people coming here don't you wish we had a border now\nAs we will are going to be confronted with these people in short time not to mention these really live safe for murder by their fans\nWe need we need to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming into our country and I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed onto ... public as like Bush George W. Bush or Paul Ryan\nNo amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior but there to those who say the border wall won't work\nThey use the same ridiculously logic I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had to be in the last hour when they say the un documents commit oh he said the court challenge me have they committed mass murder no it's not unlike the argument or have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans\nWho cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that role preventing one Hamas murderers in Israel for mentoring would have said that Israelis life\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals are given safe harbor\nYou come up with a phony arguments like illegals will not cooperate with the authorities you've heard this if they know they can be apprehended are sent home\nBut how about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with the Saudis how can you ever justify harboring\nThose who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers and ice who had the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes suffer rest of us have to live with long waists hospitals deteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nSo what's my solution I said I Would give it to you take away the benefits like free health care and preschools you for strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some see CEOs to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would stay for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake please enough of the government sending out the wrong message with bilingual education classes or bilingual government documents our country is United bites language and it's shared values\nEnglish is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our values\nAs I said our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed at Ellis Island as ... said one of the colors last hour they didn't come here for free benefits they didn't come here for free hospital care free schools\nThey didn't come here for any of that it was so happy to be in the land of freedom\nSo let's build that wall and do everything to end illegal immigration and take our country back tell me what you're thinking wanting prayer seven seven six I'm Mark ... filling in for Dennis\nTo work uh have been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a ... my daughter was actually a victim of a ... by illegal aliens using her Social Security number was restored which was a child mhm so uh I don't know why the ah\nConservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing a by by describing what's happening here in internally when people come here to work [noise]\nYeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me there's got to be an orderly procedure that house someone gets into a country we call that legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense\nYou have the opportunity to to the people you want to give the opportunity to seem so obvious to me that's\nWhy you have to have when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states of America yeah legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nThanks for taking my call more I guess one on one thing that seems to be glossed over I mean if your guest caravan of cost all they want they want they either\nPathway contented ... and the out a yellow El Salvador Guatemala decent people what's lost in those countries that almost got first got to be just gang dogs and search team or what you want to do\nYou all know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that they are they're going to be terrorists among them they're going to be people that don't value the ideals that we do in the United states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been ... as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing this some orderly process that's the whole point is argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do here the rules here the procedures you have to follow them ... President Trump Republicans are going to lose this one either way right call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in which you've got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joined in with that tried\nAnd if you uh don't stop them you have an invasion you have people coming in these people aren't coming in for silent maybe uh some of them but a lot of them we know they're kind of I don't blame them by the way to come in for jobs that coming into the benefits were the ones to blame let me know what you think when he\nPrager seven seven six Marcus for filling in for Dennis ...\nWithin a Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nUsed to our news jog nine Ninety dot com [noise]\nWithin\n... news on ... avenue in Washington\nPittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect appears briefly in court today in a wheelchair after being released the hospitals federal prosecutors meanwhile are expected to ask for the death penalty should Robert Bowers be convicted of shooting and killing a Lebanese people at the Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nMeanwhile a court hearing were set for this afternoon for a ban suspect of sending packages of explosive material to probably liberals and we're getting reports of two African Americans killed in Kentucky and what could be a hate crime us consumer spending rose by an inflation adjusted points three percent in September it\nWas let along by increased spending on health care services and motor vehicles on Wall street right now they all joined us rely a bridge and the other major indexes are doing well it's about a reverse course though down just about eighty points that stacked up by sixty this is asked her I knew\n\nMy head and the day of battle amen to on a true story of an army chaplain that is why I only stand before you today because Jesus is wrong because I have a family who loves and beliefs as\nMarriage one family under God made me appreciate family\nIf I Know I think we all have waited there\nMay be inappropriate for children under Thirteen now playing for tickets on Showtime go indivisible movie duck ...\nBy this attack them king shooter supply in king of Prussia the weather is cooler and you're starting to think about hunting season done for stopping for optic mounting ...\nRich ... is a hunter to leave it to the last minute and written missing opening day because you're Whitman isn't ready stopping and cause that item off your list see you soon king should apply in camp question here's more from king shooters supply\nNot again looking she's fine\nDon't forget about our regular classes we have a Muslim class is everything you wanted to know about gun ownership from beginning to shooting competitively in an easy and friendly morning session parents doctors listen and interact and get the answers to your question\nThat you didn't even think of asking classes to second Saturday a month and register online and king shooters dot com\nKing shooter supply into Europe Russia\nAnd visit and king shooters dot com [noise]\nTwenty four seven three sixty five you haven't had an every day so you don't want something like Medicare part D to slow you down\nAt Walgreen will take care of your Medicare part D prescriptions\nSaving you time and money sneakers which the Walgreens today and get more bang earning a hundred pounds or more points than say up to five dollars on each Medicare part D prescription Walgreens is more preferred pharmacy laundry trapped in Ninety One prescription said it applies to engineers when he sold it for purposes and other farmers can select plans point if you're in New York New Jersey or Arkansas there was one of the pie\nPlus interest Philadelphia sports fans football is back it actually that historic Franklin Field this ball flex plans single game tickets any group tickets are available now joined the uprising\nHas been athletics dot com slash tickets for coal depend ticket officer two one\nFive Ninety six one my one who was er visits\nAll the action is historic Franklin Field is ...\nDitch your books plays single game tickets to\nEurope for three reasons to download a new star nine Ninety after\nYour smartphone or tablet one instead of connection to buy gifts from our local and national hosts too easy access to W.
