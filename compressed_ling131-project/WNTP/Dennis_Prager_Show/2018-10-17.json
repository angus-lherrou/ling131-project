I didn't even know how to Maine which as far as I was just Tucker Carlson\nAnyway he has a book out because he he's thoughtful that's the reason that I'm I'm having a mom with regard to this amid a lot of people on television right books God Bless them\nBut the Tucker Carlson is worth reading a book a shipper fools that there's a great a great title Howard shellfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution so let's talk about your book the book of folks is up at the dentist Prager dot com\nSo why does it mean a ruling class who who is in that class\nWell the people that I grew up with um said just could be totally clear I'm not much of a populist and I'm certainly not a representative who coal country I mean I grew up in ... in Georgetown so it's basically people who have thrive under current economic system if you want to know with\n... you know if you look around and you and the people you know are richer than they were before the financial crisis of two thousand eight you know you're probably in that group but it's not a slur it's just you know every society higher hierarchical because people are higher make dogs are higher mammals are\nSo you're always going to have a relatively small number of people who make a disproportionate number of the question is not are you going to have a ruling class the question is are they upped the task\nOf ruling in my argument is that the people currently in charge or not and that's why we got Trump\nOkay so so ... has a very heavy stuff there let me let me dissect this for a second ruling class for you is an economic criterion not a political or prestigious criteria well\nIt is both both the ... if you look around the country to three hundred and thirty five million there almost an infinite number of decisions he made about how those people live what they can say what they do for a living\nIn a relatively small number of people make a disproportionate number of those decisions so the economic decisions are made disproportionally in New York on Wall street in Washington by the Federal Reserve the political decisions are made almost exclusively in Washington ... about what your kids watching TV or see on the Internet\nOr made almost exclusively in California and New York and Los Angeles and so\nYou know the west side of LA has a lot more influence over the country than the west side of greed though I mean that's an by the way I don't I'm not saying that's bad\nI'm just saying if you have more influence over how other people live you ought to consider yourself a steward of the country and you want to make wise decisions noxious decisions to benefit you in our leadership hats and that's\nOkay what what in your mind was there a time when the elite were steering the ship in a good direction\nWell I mean you know in a democracy you need to start with her friends will sort of democracy must habits correct with it for a functioning democracy that you have an independent self supporting growing\nMiddle class you have to have a middle class democracy only works and middle class countries it doesn't work and tip and as well where you have this dramatic wealth divide because if you give every person the vote\nNot an economic franchise they punish you by electing people like Hugo Chavez for Nicolas Maduro so you need it you need to know what you can judge the ethic of seeing the wisdom of the ruling class by how well the middle class people beneath them arguing and our middle class are shrinking an absolute terms\nAnd it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they get it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing once he should care about is the way people live the family is the very center it's the Adams in ... the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope\nOf doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel funny asking you this but I it's it's truly meant out of curiosity 'cause I respect you where do you stand on President Trump\nI\nThink that um well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the ... the majority strong with the overwhelming majority of what Trump says\nI think Tom's genius I think you need to understand from crackers for Trump's genius is not\nAffecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress I don't think Congress wants to get his program into law\nSo on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch I think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise even think about as a kind of clarity\nVery simple clarity so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Soviet do longer exists so why do we still have NATO well I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking\nSince Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why we don't Afghanistan's seven teen years later or why are we allowing\nThe south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall like what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand that is genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Trump's gone those questions will hang in the air\nThan my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to\nYou need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at that\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests who I find ah intellectually morally intolerable which is which\nIs fine [laughter] okay\nSo I just want to know what you see their name as listed on your program note this is who well how long do you think oh my

justice heartening course she's afraid to use real reason\nThe left produces evil people and this is an example of that that's what she should upset but they don't say because Republicans don't
