[laughter] ... [laughter] pretty limited to speak you got to do these I was your best or the other state but All right so tell us the thesis of your book\n\nSo that I wrote the book uh obviously you know from my background that for instance prime minister but in the context but who world by now have by run my own global consulting business in which I one of the things we do it by\nThe clients around the world about political risk and political uncertainty and and how to respond and prepare for that but also on chairman of the idea with the global federation of conservative party includes the Republican Party the United states\nAnd a twenty sixteen I had been serving a obviously a theory of\nNew and unorthodox than unexpected electro ... Donald Trump election both primary victories and general election victory was the big us but the upset ... Brecht referendum though I was so called populist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what um how leaders business and political but particularly how conservatives should respond to some of this so that is really the essence of the topic\nAnd I get to put my feet it's in a nutshell which some people would find surprising I think the populace I'm as they raised the concerns of the market and trade and immigration the globalization that many of their concerns are correct\nAnd that we have to do a better a job in terms of policy we have an equally respond to be concerned but the way to respond to them is through um you know good a good conservative respond to conserve the answers\nSo let me ask you the the mainstream media which of course is almost synonymous with being on the left\nAround the world and picked all of these as sort of a nation almost fascism in a battery and in Poland now Brazil and the United states what is your response to that\nBy any anybody who says that really clearly has no understanding of what fascism was um you know the\nFascist movement which does exist and some corners and some dark circles or the movement from the century Nineteen twenties and I hit thirty it was a very different ... that most of this right wing populism is not to say that in some cases there aren't a than some of the extreme there are some similarities but\nUm you know populism or people you see that on the left a liberal media you caught mainstream media I call it liberal media 'cause that's what it is um you know they frankly equate anything they disagree with with that that kind of the standard response\nBut populism has a long political tradition popular but then on the right left and better and popular or people who\nAre wrongly are often trying to bring the concerns of large map with the people concerned they believe are being ignored in a public debate in public arena\nAnd um I think it's undeniable whether one at ... for instance with the concerns of are the issues Mr Trump has raised on trade and immigration the matters like that\nThere is no doubt that he is speaking for a large mass of people who are concerned about these policies\nAnd are you familiar I'm sure you are like just a quick take on hungry in Poland\n\nYeah look I Try not to I'm a kind of\nGet into talking day to day politics of the various member part of the I you know I'm a I you know I Would say obviously in the case of Hungary\nI'm what I've heard of them support for Mr Bond more than anything has been his ... that's been um to illegal um an irregular migration over his board or something that the population supports them on and that the right to support him on\nWho so tell us a little I I was not familiar with this and I think is a reporter for my listeners to know about the ... the international Democrat union so tell us what one is that\nYeah so it was set up\nA believe it or not it was actually set up in Nineteen eighty three\nAre under the Reagan Administration um the original vice president George W. Bush with the spine or at the London Declaration that established the new prime minister Thatcher cancer colon Germany or structure Iraq who I Believe was mayor of Paris at the time but the leader of the\nBetter right in France a day and a number of other leaders think it was about thirty five at the time came together to form a global federation of conservative party that has\nThat fairly regularly in the decades that followed was very active than had some prominent near the end of the Cold War is the\nLeaders obviously coordinated their policies or you know researching conservatism coordinated their policies that were up ... successful and very short order and bringing down the Berlin Wall of the Soviet Empire but the organization has continued to exist then\nAnd my vision board is really one way or\nConservative activists and operatives really share best practices on campaigning in on governing so we just had a gathering of a hundred representatives of our various parties around the world and and the Los Angeles recently actually\n[noise] [noise] so I share something I Would love to get your take on\nWhen I think of Canada I I think of a tough to Canada as in many ways the same way I think of America to America as a left in her right is that is that a a valid perception or not so valid\nUm I probably would quarrel with it and it's in that sense there's no doubt um there's no doubt that in Canada\nA oh I Know merit many Americans uh conceive of Canada's they have very left wing country I'm In fact conservative movements very strong candidate you mentioned I cover in ten years we just had elections recently where and our two largest province of Ontario and Quebec or writers that our government came to office so\nWe have a significant um conservatism and considerate movement in our country but our country is far less polarized\nAnd kind of what you would call left right camps than the United states a really a remarkably less polarized than part of the reason I wrote the book the trends I talked about in the book the trend of\nYou know very poor economic outcomes for a lot of middle and working class people and the political disruption and populist movements we're now seeing they really have not hurting hand at the same degree\nSo my book is not a book can I my ... really is about ... from my perspective why some of the lessons and some of the practices we followed in Canada helped the boy some of the challenges and how they can help here the conservative movement in the United states and elsewhere throughout\nThe book ladies and gentlemen is right here right now I'm speaking to us the former prime minister of Canada for ten years conservative no less\nAnd the book is up at the dentist Prager dot com right here right now and this man is as you could tell was obviously very thoughtful\nAccounting is a very important country in the world and we need to know more about it we need to understand for example the worldwide conservative a resurgence I mean it's happening\nThat's what he's explaining [noise]\nI Need every one of you to do that I spoke to I spoke about the Quebec elections it was astonishing founded on this on the show [noise] All right every body mind Dennis ... even for his book yourself as soon as Prager is on how we reserve\nThe release\nI Would not today consider the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of its day to day coverage of federal politics but its editorial rely line remains relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where would an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nTo hide it tough yeah you have a while you have you have\nTo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will pod cast um you know I think there is a big market in Canada for that kind of thing to take off as I said there is a\nYou know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom a kind of the the the low number\nAnd so that that audience as in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me\nIn fact the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada\nIs that the caller lean to the same basic rights so it was but but on the issues they differ ... justice clearly as the left white differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued ... why isn't there that polarization\nI I think the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalizations about our country but it's a fact that Canadians having more civil public discourse than always have um it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or heart or left liberal would be much smaller and the\nPercentage of the population that would float between party significantly bigger and Canada\nPlots Dana I think the other factor that often forgotten when people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two parties and that really changes the dynamic significantly I always say well you know the strictly to party them\nYou know each candidate a hack candidate B. he can bring candidate the down in a\nIn a system where you got more than two parties there's always a risk the candidate intact Kennedy be effectively the winner becomes Kennedy the who's\nNot oh about an hour I listen to this has been a great honor ... book is right here right now it is with Dennis ... thank you for [noise]\n\nUsed to I used to I mean nine Ninety ...

children of divorced struggling with the um and I just it seems like there's um\nThis phenomenon that somebody knows about that nobody's really talking I'm certainly I think my son's struggle with um um moms over there that do the here and um and of course I guess in my case I'm the father seems like\nA it was the one giving up um it was kind of what I've experienced in\nOrder to vote for you about um adult children struggling with their parents being\nThe how old were your children when you when you divorced\nMy two older ones were let me think er and er just graduated college and uh and then I have a younger son and a six string\nWell so okay well the youngest son is obviously not an older child honor\nI have some of the I'm a lot of false on this question and one of them is just for people to think about people who stay together for the sake of their children do will divorce after they graduate high school\nOr will divorce after they graduate college\nOr it doesn't seem to work out quite as they think and in many instances precisely for what you point out that it really or has it emotionally affected them even in college or after college is that your point\nOh yeah and even into adulthood and\nEven into adulthood OK yes okay so I'm gonna just use this to say a few words and I thank you for your call [noise]\n[noise] well this is a very a a a ... a very interesting topic and one that I I'd like to have some therapists on the show one day and not necessarily the happiness our even\nI Know a man a very good men who divorced and his daughters were in their thirties\nMid thirties when he divorced and he stayed\nWith their mom in large measure to protect them and then he did that and they got very angry at him in one stop talking to him for a while and I just thought ill\nThat daughter I never met her in my life just wanted to make that clear but I I thought she was a child who the hell are you to tell your parents or your father in this case she cannot have a happy life because you want him to stick with bomb when you're thirty five years of age\nI I you know I Am from what I had heard I never I never met the other woman but you know this was a difficult woman\n\nNow you know I Am you know this notion of I Am your child you own me I'm Thirty years old and you owe me to stay intact\nI don't buy it I think it starts to cystic\nRight and\nSo the truth is the only ideal age if there is such a thing for you to divorce is when they're too\n[laughter] All right I mean to be honest like the best is not to divorce if you if if if you can all work out a good marriage OK second best this divorce divorce when they are very very young and\nThey don't know anything different it's it's basically a non issue if you follow the other two rules about poisoning the parents are not spoiling them\nBut uh I I don't know how effective I don't know when I when I say I don't know it's\nNot a euphemism for I don't agree I just don't know is waiting till a certain age better I'll Wait till they graduate high school kids whose parents were divorced while they're in college\n...

go to your calls\n\nA we begin with Kevin in Cleveland Hi Kevin Cleveland\nIdentify that probably was the top yeah thank you\nThat's all we have thoroughly respect everything being so much for your ... your ...\nWell You're welcome [laughter]\nUm my one question or I guess I got tons of 'em but I guess the one on top of my mind is that if\nIt would be of any advice for honoring a parent who's withdrawn or not really interested in being involved with me and my family it kind of stems back to divorce issues and what your previous talk in the past our um\nBut or I guess residual effects from a divorced childhood [noise] um but I guess in starting a new family started over which my mom has done for fame and she has a totally different experience but I'm with him and I don't know if it's more\nWhere I got me only need to understand something so he that your parents divorced and then he withdrew from you\nAre I guess not not in that or not I I'm not in Pennsylvania but they're like over ... years haven't started new families both of them my father is more kind of involved with a new you know his his wife\nAnd right so I did so why why summarized you accurately you're saying that he withdrew from you because he became preoccupied with the new alright seems that way so you're asking how old are you\nHonor him 'cause I'm a big one on honoring parents in almost every case so adamant so\nMy my biggest one apple about okay well that's my biggest example of honoring parents staying in communication if they don't if they are a\nAmbivalent or if they are recalcitrant are hesitant\nYou have to do what you have to do\nSo uh you you make you make periodic calls or you send an email just checking in if they don't want to respond they didn't you we have to do the right thing and again this is this is my single biggest example of why I Believe people need religion\nPeople for me to be told on or your father and your mother because of God wasn't behind that\nA lot of people would not honor their parents so since ... told me the honor my parents are unless it is an extraordinary situation of pure evil on their part I have to do that how they respond is their business whether I honored them is my business\n\nFor ... hard to have a a one sided relations\nYou're right so what do you want a city you send email and that's it\nYou you will be able to uh have a peaceful life\nAfter your parent is gone you did your best you will have no guilt feelings I don't know why don't cost you to periodically got in touch it's not a big deal\nOr if there's no positive reinforcement than there is no positive reinforcement my father call his mother every night she yelled at him every night\nHe put the phone on the kitchen table I hear her yelling at him he picked up the phone and go ... put it back down and he and he had absolutely no guilt feelings after she left this world\nOkay okay All right thank you You're welcome\nIt's ... and this is the beauty of of feeling that that ... the almighty has the creator of the earth has told me what to do it doesn't say\nOn or your parents provided they respond provided they're nice [laughter] you don't need a command to honor nice parents [laughter] that's that's the whole point it out or your father and mother even if they're twitch\nFact if you end up the Hebrew word for father and the Hebrew word for ... there you\nGo you know because you had letters and he brought letters all have in America liquid ...\nThat they go I'm kidding about the ... the parrot but are there was a joke okay but a ... that's that's the whole point is is this is the power of it\nSo I'll I'll make go they go a little ad for myself please get the rational Bible it'll change your life I promise if you read the book will I promise\nI'm explaining the greatest book it it means to be explained\nFair if you're an atheist it's called the rational Bible ... uh okay I'll leave it at that ah let's see here thank you Kevin is an important thing and let's go to Andy in Chandler, Arizona Hi Andy\nIt's a prayer good to talk here again thank you um that question so my son was in kindergarten and\nIn the Catholic school and I went to twelve years a Catholic school so I Know how to discipline is and I appreciate that he recently\nI don't know how to approach my my son's teacher because\nI'm On a break I only took a boy's hand over his crotch with clothes on\nWhen I'm Sorry I Can't wait who did this to your son\nNow my son took a boy and\nAn old your its weight so your son took a boy's hand and put it on his crotch on your songs clash okay\nSo he was put in um eras suspended yesterday right and I'm ahead unless low initial meeting with the teacher and you know she said we're lucky that the other parents didn't want to press charges [laughter]\nShift\nI don't know how to follow up so ... well okay so how old is your son\nSit right in kindergarten right\nOkay I got you show\nA\nWhen you asked your son why did you do it why did he say\nHe said they were looking for a marker on her a table and there were a bunch of kids looking for the marker and he just\nHe just he didn't really have an explanation\nFor rights there was like a joke it was like ... or I assume [noise] yeah yeah I don't I I don't think it was a sexual act\nI don't think so and they never done\nAny ... like All right well I Want to want to look I'm happy the school didn't suspend them [noise]\nAh it's a it's we live in a paranoid age in this regard today as a Alan Dershowitz put in sexual McCarthyism in the country in the guise of liberal Democrats are going to\nThe dentist Springer show from the release that you're\nWell I certainly will ponder that I I don't know that I I agree with that but I Will\nCertainly don't know exactly anyway the issue is not even agreement the issue is us how does the juicy it you know ... on on matters of face\nA you know I always say if I don't I don't expect agreement and it's not even a significant to me so so so there's different so walk but the ... it's the values that's why we speak of Judeo Christian values about Judeo Christian theology\nI I agree but I guess it is the book of Isaiah for example divinely inspired\nWhere God Speaks to why they are\nIt's just as much guard as God's speaking in the Torah but but where you have other statements that it doesn't say and God said so then it's as I said like proverbs or weeklies he asked these that is not from God\nOkay well that's a that's a hell for clarification of differences then I I understand that\nGood God Bless you and I made it thank you so much focus Okie and Kevin in North Hollywood, California Hi\nYes yes Hi Dennis I have a question for you yes okay show yesterday [noise]
