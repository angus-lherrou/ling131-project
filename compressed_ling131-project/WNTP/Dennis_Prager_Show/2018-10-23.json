you about a very special different exceptional one gym rat more has fought for hundreds of people who've been injured by medical malpractice car accidents slip and fall cases he's argued and won a

very very warm feelings about the city have been there in a while it's sort of my ah my new\nTampa I'm that's replacing Tampa it's up there ... there is ... yeah that is a while you're right because how often the wife say though is exactly right\nOne of the painful things and then I Want to give it to the president's speech last night I got a lot to talk to you about one of the painful things to me about\nThe these attacks on America and specifically white Americans is how many wonderful white Americans there really are\n[laughter] to ... to ...\nAnd they're wonderful people of every group obviously but you're only allowed to the same white Americans is if there's something particularly noxious about white America\nWhat America is a lot of beautiful people with it\n[noise] it's really disgusting it's just disgusting I hate to so overwhelmingly from one direction but it's just painful but people live in denial about\nThe way I commend to you my column my Tuesday column I am actually so the kid of color comes out on Tuesdays I commend it to you\nNational Review town hall Dennis Prager about calm American greatness many many places Kerry and many local newspapers most recently the Cleveland Plain dealer today's GOP political it is it is about\nThe question based on my experience of car dealers last week on the issue of male ambition specifically and other matters of young people talk about later I Want you to hear some clips the president spoke in Houston\nUh yesterday to a an enormous crowd uh they they about Eighteen thousand filled the arena\nAnd you know who who gets those numbers on the left and I I I'm not making an argument I'm asking a question who does get those those Brock Obama get those numbers I Am very\nCurious who gets those numbers on the left anyway\nI uh I Want you to hear some of the things first there's this one is very powerful or about who we worship want to want to play that one show him\nWe\nStand for our\nPart of the center of American lives so true\nWe don't worship\nNow I ... it so I when I listen to these things this is just a habit of a lifetime when ever I listened to such things like whenever I speak I hear the voice of leftists in my brain\nIt's an automatic response to me it's almost ... how exactly is someone on the left responding and of course they lows everything that was just said loaded\nSo that is to give away as to this very important distinction between left and long left the you low was what was just said if you don't you're not a leftist\nAnd what is it exactly that is a load some about it so let's go part by part let's begin again if you would show on with the kneeling and the flick\nKneeling and the flag\n\nWe proudly stand for our\nSo hold on their ... why is that load some that we proudly stand for a national anthem and for our national flag why why would that be loads up\nTo a leftist\nIt's worth it's worth analyzing I'd like you to play this\nUh for a friend and say listen I just want to understand how you think I'm not going to argue I Wanna I I assume that you find is objectionable so let let let me in ... what is bad about that we Pratt proudly stand\nFor our national anthem and our national flag\nAnd by the way I frankly don't know the answer I almost always know what a leftist will say\nBut I this one's a tough one what what are they going to say to proudly stand for the national anthem of the national flag gives an act of white supremacy I it's a code word for bigotry\nIt's a a dog whistle to Xena phobia wanted I don't know exactly what they would find I Know they find it frightening and disgusting and the thought of Eighteen thousand people cheering forests are further reinforces their\nDisgust but I I really want you to understand that it's a fairly recent vintage in American Life\nThat people would find a president saying we proudly stand for our national anthem and our flag to be disgusting let alone fascist okay this is this is because we have gone so far left\nBeyond where the left was even one generation to go next please\nAt the center of American Life so true\nOkay All right so hold on there so so so yeah so okay so what would they left to say what's wrong with their faith in families the truth center of the American democracy or not ... was a government and bureaucracy\nSo you may recall a democratic convention a number of years ago we played it on the show a number of times I was I was actually at that convention I heard it live\nWhere they ... the ... the a narrator the dmc that whatever term is used for the voice of a convention that you know the residents voice\nGovernment is what Americans all Americans have in common or is the one thing all Americans share something to that effect\nThey really do believe that it has supplanted faith and family government and a bureaucracy he's right about that\nSee it's four percent of the west as soon as the president says something to a crowd in particular it is considered Neal fishes stick and all the usual adjectives thrown out\nBut I I really want to know from people what is wrong with that is faith and family knocked the center the lynchpin of American Life should not be\nHow you admit that it's that it's gradually no longer the case\nOf faith and family forty percent of Americans born to unwed mothers now and faith is dwindling\nBut is that a good thing that's a question to ask a a person of the west in your life ... number three claim number three of the president [noise]\nWe don't worship [noise]\nIt it was as if he took a line and I'm going to be ... plying them out of my mind that\nThat he is I'm just saying it was it was as if he would be from my current\nVideo up at ... are you a preview university on the American trinity that's exactly right because as government gets bigger God get smaller and the western world that's exactly what is happening government has some place the state has replaced God\nBut that is entirely accurate\nSo there were three claims all of which would be found disgusting on the part of the left now when we get back I Will play you left wing reactions to another comment that he made in Houston [noise] last night

the American founders thought that since human nature stinks the less power concentrated him individuals' hands the better\nSo but the left believe people are basically good especially themselves they know that they are basically good because they're enlightened\nAnd therefore all the power that they could have will only be used benign only that is what they believe these people are fools by definition left this may be sweet they may be a whole host of things but to the extent that they have left wing views they're fools\nAnd foolish miss begins with the belief that power concentrated in a few people's hands if they are lightened enough is just wonderful they really do believe essentially in benign dictatorships that's what they believe the founders believed in diffusion of power separation of powers\nThat's why we have a Congress that's why we have an executive and that's why we have a court that is also why we have a U.S Senate to diffuse power among the states the left hates the Senate\nHates the Senate\nBecause it doesn't just reflect majority will because after all Wyoming with a with a fewer than a million people has as many senators is California worthwhile I don't know thirty million forty million people but it's completely non democratic which is exactly what they wanted this to be\nThey did not believe in democracy that is from their perspective and its lack of faith in humanity mob rule\nSo folks this is just a note today because you don't learn that at school who's going to teach it to you you're left wing professor they don't even know what I just said it's not even a matter of suppressing if they've never heard that\nThey don't understand that if the diffusion of power amongst many is a guard is guards against dictatorship\nBut did they want the EU wants more and more power they're perfect example concentrated in Brussels that's why there was a Brexit they were shocked that a majority of Britain did not by the idea that Britain should seated sovereignty to a larger\nInstitution called the European Union\n\nIf you believe people are basically good then it's great\nTo concentrate power in a few people's hands if you don't believe

the truth is that it happened on ... under President Obama and the economy was was not good\nYou are right that there is it that they know how good things are in the United states in how low the unemployment rate is so that they could most likely get a job but uh it it's remember ... look let's be honest compared to hunt Doris in Guatemala\nThe American economy is always robust so these people aren't sitting down with the wall Street Journal and checking out the stock prices that they they know where it's better here is the point though that the key point and that is just should be made every single day\nWhy would these people want to replicate the failed societies from which they come\nBy the way I Know again for the left who in their superficial little intellectual bubble

other question anyone\nIn Latin America thinking about the economic situation there are other situations but thinking about economics there is no other question to be asked\nWhy does America work why don't Americans ask that question why does America work but they don't instead the left asked asks why is America so racist\nXena phobic and homophobic and Islamophobia could cetera\nWhat you what

junkies\nBut of course nobody remembers what they saw on the news or read the day before was saying you shouldn't be up on the news I obviously I Am I have to be I Want to be\nBut ultimately to use the term ultimately the ultimate issues are what matter\nThen you need a vision of life today's program today's topic\nIs so important that I only wonder if I've ever devoted an era to it I mentioned it ... I mentioned it in passing regularly but I don't know if I've ever devoted to an hour to be you have to see one\nYou're checking for going back very for some indication\nAnd\nThat subject is a word that is not easy it's the most important thing and it's not used\nWhich is a a real reason for the problems and troubles of our time in America is having the worst in the world generally it's the W. word that with the double your booze\nAnd do what people will now thinking thinking work\nWorse\nBut how many people even if I say the bill your word no wisdom you know it's you know how bad it is how bad the situation is it the word is boring to most people\nSay to a young person would you like to be wise I think you will get to the response\nWhat do you mean would you like wisdom what do you mean\nWould you prefer wisdom or a new iPhone\n[laughter]\n\nThe federal really that will really do it I Would I think that the somebody needs to do a poll or with a I I'm not even just ... you know under forty\nIf you could have every you could have a new the newest model Android or the newest model I phoned every year for the rest of your life\nOr wisdom yeah [laughter] I Wonder what people would vote for but I think most people will say what you mean that's the point it's not valued\nLet me tell you ... where this is it my whole life it it has been a ... a love I Want to understand why does wisdom understanding of life that is what wisdom is okay it's a it's it's the single word term for understanding of life\nYou can know a great deal and understand nothing that is why the highly educated are usually the least wise members of our society\nA because universities teach the opposite of wisdom they teach you to be a fool in my opinion some people escape on harmed but many dealt effectively because they teach you implicitly from up explicitly\nThat knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n[noise]\nWalk to what aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender\nWhat does it show that Shakespeare's poster was taken down at the University of Pennsylvania English department\nIt shows a lack of wisdom because he wrote the wisest plays written in the English language but it's not valued\nAll that matters is not wisdom bought in this case race and gender so they they dismissed him because he was a white\nMale and they put up a female I don't know what color\nWisdom without wisdom you can't do good\nVis and good is what most concerns me good versus evil you can't be a good person if if you're a fool and the food is the opposite of the ... person and those of you who are biblical you oriented build up the word food is used pretty often\nWas the fool the food was the person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion in setting social policy\n\nWith me if it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if it's only that sinks in in making political social policy for a society wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world vast amount of compassion or pseudo compassion that doesn't matter even if it's genuine compassion but compassion without wisdom is utterly destructive\nSo I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies are going to continue the discussion about wisdom book or give you an example here I\nFeel bad for people who don't have as much as others and so we will give them more benefits\nBut the wise person asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is it compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with wisdom\n\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is taught wisdom is in Salt it isn't talked because it isn't soft\n\nI Believe ultimately that the radical secularization of western society is at the core of the lack of wisdom\n\nWhen I get calls this I have I Know I mentioned before when I get calls here from what's a twelve or Fifteen year old\nThe kid talks about\nPort and things of life I Am certain that they are in a religious hold
