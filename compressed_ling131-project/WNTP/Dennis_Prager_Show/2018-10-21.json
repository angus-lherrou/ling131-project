own power thyroid kicking it so I can tell you a lot about the drug for many reasons we were probably one of the first um clinics in the area to use it that's how much we liked it and how much

there were no TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox\nDo you remember the French paradox this is a counterintuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best aggravates genes that control our weight or energy healthy a junior leaving longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was spiritual yes ... the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nNow our guest today says that's just half\nThe story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce improve or Twenty years Dr precedent is the institution of New York radio host these own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a long time product formulated and high level advisor for purity products Dr ...\nWelcome aboard mark ... speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them as long as we're a drawl phenomenon those people out there who just the vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals or weekend every one of them seems to have an article about ... basically erodes virtual is what we call a poly sci and all it's found in red wine it's round in purple grape juice and found in berries that they've been found in you know\nAnd the interesting thing about Roseburg patrolled is it's actually produced by plants I glance\nSpouse to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation and the scientists really first became interested in resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberry ritual was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish\nWell anything that extends the life of anything is going to get the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow\nWell by two thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex\nAnd here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that resveratrol counteracted that negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seemed to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and an even seemed to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal ... activity in the body it improved in ...\nWas even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring story aerobic activity and it\nEven proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading that an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reserve mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any proceeds health threats like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they call the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a cellular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard and this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking ... pretty much every day\nLet me tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan and it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases\nYour longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity gene they get switched on they help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt\nIn fact this gene helps increased tissue repair and switched on by a group of genes called short too and now they've found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases these longevity genes these are two inch\nWell so does resveratrol at least in their animal studies and this is exactly ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially use any traditional compound ... actively target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement that our health and our aging and our longevity\nWhile another person you say that took you ten ... elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented and so well researched maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why co Q. ten research is so widely respected\nWell let's go back to Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin the Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana University of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti often cause major studies major universities right here with the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have energy combine that with ...

vitamin B. twelve yeah now many people go through life not knowing that they've got a co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine wow I mean that's a lot of people now listen to this\nWay most people think of vitamin D day I think of bone and bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course but\nAlso it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and a great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function and support the healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the University of Hawaii

real time pain relief people have a I have a special oriental pull those details out and let you know what that is\nAnd ... the uh two minutes here let's let's get started with a couple of things because there's a lot to talk about related to the rain and soggy soil\nAnd disease problems are popping up and trees are falling down and all that kind of thing\nA quite a bit of the country especially uh down here where the\nHurricanes have pushed the clouds in the rain a lot of people that a lot of rain tremendous amounts of rain we've had record levels and I've never seen rains create a situation where the ground has become so completely saturated in taking longer\nThan normal to dry out\nAnd the result of that is some plant problems they're popping up the ones that are creating the most questions probably trees are in that category as oil and we'll get into that but the turf problems with the ones that I'm hearing about the most\nAnd a lot of people or scratching their head about what to do\nIn turf in the south we have Bermuda assign are stains origin and other things as oil up north it's mostly the cool season grasses of course ... and\nAnd uh uh bent grass and bluegrass those are the ones that are the most common a lot of times it's a bubble when those cool season grasses\nAnd all of these things are similar conditions can pop up no matter what kind of grass you have probably where we have the most\nDifficulty or especially right now is in St Augustine grass and I've seen it I'm staying home on properties and a lot of people are sending pictures and I'm seeing it all over the place and you can have fungal disease problems\nIn the turf that can be take all fetch are great least bought our brown patch probably some other things to almost like damping all\nIn seedlings a mixture of fungal diseases but\nAh we'll take a break ... only will come back and talk about all three of those ... or recommend that you can do more work the best there's advice out there that don't agree\nDown them away from our house\nIn Dallas and ... and after this for a long time they continue to leaving on automatic and let it run even during rained periods and we're trying to get something to happen there and so wherever you are you going to help those kinda things with your own property with other people to that'd be that'd be good\nSo um [noise] anyway the turf or if you look at it\nAnd use the great big uh blobs of yellow that are rich that are yellow circles or poop freeform shapes and the shapes and they grow and sometimes the yellow will be stronger on the outside of the ages of those\nOf spots and to be a a little bit better color inside\nThat brown patch and brown patch this year has been around since the middle of the summer we had some really good\nRain events in the summer that were interspersed but you know between extremely hot periods and that stress the turf quite a bit and the the brown patch started showing up earlier than normal usually it's a ... it's a fall kind of a fungal problem but not always\nThe other thing is if you look out and you see the turf just kind of a yellow color kind of fading the green is is fading to a a a lighter color and even trying to get to\nA yellow if you look closely at it a lot of times in that case you'll see these little gray or brown spots on this show actually sign auction grass is going to happen on lawyers you know the grass as well but mostly you see it on St Augustine grass\nThat's called grey leaf spot and ... is fungal also both of these were fungal diseases they just happened to be\nTwo different species and then the third thing that you can see is a a a color change in the turf and it starts dying but there's no pattern to it it's kind of a ... just looks like\nOverall it's sickening it's dying out kind of spotty looking all over the turf\nIn most cases that's not good news either because that take all patch and that's a fungal disease as oil\nOkay what do you do for all you do the same thing for all three of these and you do the same thing for a one more that all throwing here as well this is a question that came of Bob ask me about on his show yesterday\nAnd that is what do you do for the oil that has washed and instill that in and uh you know packed in from all this rain too so or a answers for all of them all talk about I Want to come

and it's a fact of at this rate is just mix it fifty fifty with water\nWell you can do the same thing you can mix a fifty fifty with the ready to use ... ... ... it it you know in a mixture that's ready to spray\nAnd then just mix diversion peroxide that's got to dilute the Garrett Jews so you you don't have to do that you can make it twice as strong so you when you put the uh you can use the hydrogen peroxide to replace\nA you know part of the water and so the the Garrett juice is going out a full strength\nAnd the higher Prague sides going out at about\nHalf the strength of the three percent from the grocery store to automate about one it's going to be a little over one percent so you can do it either why if you do alludes to Garret use rage ... words half strength you're still going to get some benefits from it\nAnd it's going to save money is going to go use less Garrett use per spry and the main thing you're trying to do anyway\nIs to spray the hydrogen peroxide and kill the passage and you know that you're not primarily doing Foley are feeding so you can you can dilute the ready to use so it makes the gear juice half strength or\nJust let the hydrogen peroxide
