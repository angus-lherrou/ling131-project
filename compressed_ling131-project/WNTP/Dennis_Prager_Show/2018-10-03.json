triple gee the living martyr and I have feminine sucked I Do I Believe that\nAnd sure enough tripled jeeze feminine side came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card after I laughed at him for about five minutes we resume the conversation [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise] that\nThey have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they have cars that yes running water showers bats yes\nNo no no no it's amazing even even automatic transmissions said\nThat at the amazing I Know I Know\nI Can't believe that question did they have gift cards while he was that held his that hilarious they've gift cards no no they was invented when you were born oh my God\nThis this generation we keep him around as like a sort of a a a you know to stay in touch with what the with what the the new folk think anyway\nWhy they Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nAnd that is that that's the theory that I'm I'm working on women love too by the way there's no better or worse here this is the er at all there there is no such thing in this regard I'm simply offering you may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nWell obviously or I wouldn't have said it but you know what what\nDo you ever take see and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add that so what is your Dennis prayers feminine side and I said it to these guys and the the the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a so [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe I have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him shoot them uh dramas where you know action to action dramas when la fast yes Ben love high speed car chases\nThe guy shot him and this and and as it does do ... such high explosives [laughter] ... explosions [laughter] that was great\nI I I I I I turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion it it it does nothing for me\nBut a romantic comedy I Am totally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation\nI mean I loved sleepless in Seattle I I was riveted yes I Know that you guys have yes I you don't even have to turn it off that's right triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you liked both correct that was your statement\nYou like a romantic comedies and and explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit\nBut that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and the loved women I have to wait and the ... the early days and and that's right and gift cards that is correct you see Dr ... do you see that that that that is a gift card slip through them that is exactly right\nYeah yeah and exploded the gift card did explode [laughter] so everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what if it [laughter]\nSo I Am this this ah bail female that there should is devoted\nTo Denis says Feehery on gift card versus gift I didn't ask my wife I ... I I I I you know as well as I Know her\nI could say what do you think you know my wife very well what do you think sue would would would answer\nIt's a tough one what would your wife answer I suspect the gift yeah okay I I Do [noise] I Know there is a good argument in both I think if she likes the gift I think she'd be very touched\nBut I Would be touched too if I like the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting the that\nAre are very small ... who knows better what I Want then I that's my that's my rational male brain talking\nSo let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift right since the generous gift a hundred dollar gift\nThat somebody spends they have thought to it\nAnd and I know they gave thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing people think that you're getting them a gift certificate chose you didn't think he took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all\n[noise] listen don't couples set up one of a cold when they set up an account at a at a department store or a furniture store\nYou you know what I mean you know ... people no no come on guys you guys are so out of it you don't you [noise] couples marrying set up a thing what is it called\n[laughter] this is a problem when you work with men\nUh any way they set up an account\nAnd you'd ... you'd get past that way they could get the the the dishes they want\nThey can get their register that thank you that's right they register with the store now All right you're right I should've known knowing romantic comedies but the last time there was a registry even romantic comedy was Eighteen sixty nine the first I'm\nA picture of protected [noise]\nSo now that's an example though right that's like a gift\nCard [noise] ... ... are couples are touched by that if you give in to their registry [noise] All right this is

even tangentially related to this sad moment\nShe there Oh yes I Am okay go ahead it is it is\nI I Hope she didn't get in trouble\nWell she high but it's over [laughter] [laughter]\nI honestly I prefer cash because the card game and they have much stores make all get hired\n... twenty five dollar gift card yeah something for twenty twenty when you talk to weapon that gift card and you're going to bring\nAll that is a very good point I never thought of them that much money that way you know what they're saying\nThat it's very interesting you're so right but there's something that seems to be about well if yeah it seems almost tacky and it's and it's ridiculous because it's no different from a gift card but I don't know what you give a guy an envelope with a hundred dollar bill said again\nI don't you get to spend all the\nCash you know no you're right I I couldn't agree more\nThat you may be pulled the class lap it up in the life a little gift\nA big one or a big one [laughter] [laughter] that's funny\nThat's a very funny thought you give somebody gets a big box the bail opened it up there's a hundred dollar bill on the bottom [laughter] All right I agree yeah\nThat was what I Want better than me and it and it at my age now want something it that\nWay so you're sixty three you at forty three would have preferred a gift yeah\nAll right so I don't think see I don't think it's age related uh I have to yeah I I don't I think I think it's more sex related and that's my theory but I you know obviously you you do you prefer the the the money [noise]\nUh there's a there's a there's a very er here All right good we have a male who prefers the gift will take a thank you Christine Marty in Indianapolis, Indiana high\nA dentist but my first time caller as well the first time

or wait wait wait wait wait wait so why is that a female trait\nFemales because women want to go shopping\nOh and so if they have the gift card they could go shopping that's an interesting take on this\nIn a second or ... or ... and\nWe know it's more efficient but that's not the the ... the mayor shall we want more fish so why why so wait we\nOften talk and talk and men just want to fix the problem they're more personal\nSo we'll wait wait then OK forgive me I don't know if it's not I'm not following your argument or I I did until now if it's more efficient and then that's more masculine because the male says I just want what I Want I don't I'm not as interested into\nBetter that if you sell your hand me I'd get it done this or I don't have to go shopping so it's a very uh actually I got my gift on gun\nRight one of the chances of you are really wanting that gift as opposed to getting what you want to\nInstill more efficient because then if\nI have no risk fishing I don't know why it's more efficient you could do it online I mean that that takes its gotta be really lazy not to burn takes time [laughter] but I also\nGo shopping and shopping and I'm like\nI say are okay All right that's an argue that's a good argument okay I never thought of it obviously [noise] women love shopping so they would therefore like the gift card considered enables them to go shopping with somebody
