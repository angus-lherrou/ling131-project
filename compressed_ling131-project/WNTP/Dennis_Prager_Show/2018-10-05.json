hear all about and we're going to hear about over dinner I Can't wait my God Bless you taught in the good fight when you're ready to order this pillow my pillow dot com promo code might G\nThe pillow dot com promo code my G. two for one right now and also eight hundred nine to age six oh three for ... my G. [noise]\nThank you so much for spending now this eventful day with us\nBreaking news addition to the Mike Gallagher show by Monday we're going to know whether judge Kavanaugh is justice Kavanaugh or not joined us then I have a safe weekend [noise] keep fighting the good fight on Mike Gallagher God Bless America [noise]\nListen live anywhere in the world at W. N. D. be dead gum [noise]\nUp for vote [noise] you\nCannot closed debate and culture it's cold\nAnd you cannot extrapolate necessarily from that vote to how they will vote in actuality\nSo you can vote for cloture and then vote against Brett Kavanaugh so it is not a given at all in my mind that he will\nBe\nNominated by the spot or chosen or ratified ... confirmed by the U.S so there's not a given\nI heard and I have to verify heard that a Republican senator from Montana it will be attending his daughter's wedding is walking down the aisle ... Saturday\nSo that would deprive the Republicans up another vote already Lisa Murkowski she even voted against cloture now it's theoretically possible she would vote for Kavanaugh having voted for cloture but it is unlikely\n\nI just my heart breaks for the man and I don't know what else I can tell you\nI have made my case\nFrom the beginning that it did not deserve the U.S Senate hearing you cannot make a high school accusation that has never been made against any one Republican or Democrat with zero corroboration\nAnd have the United States Senate close its functions and an entertainment\nCharge\nIt just it wouldn't be done with anything else\nYou know we uh we we saw him in gay I saw him engage in an armed robbery and high school\nI think they would have stopped the U.S Senate for that hearing a fully credible person\nI saw Brett Kavanaugh engage them armed robbery armed robbery when he was a junior in high school\nAnd\nGuess what I Khamenei the people who uh who saw him do it and then every one of them says I don't know what the person's talking about including one of them who is a best friend\nOf the person making the accusation\nSo why is why did the why does the U.S government shutdown why does the U.S population preoccupied with one charge from one woman from high school thirty five years ago why and we all know why because we live in the age\nAs stated by a professor Alan\nDershowitz at Harvard law school a lifelong liberal Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism that is why\n[noise]\nI I don't and he said it's darker it's a darker period than that and this is a liberal Democrat but one of the only ... only the only liberals with courage liberals are not leftist but they are but they are very weak\nWill accept the case and the rare case of an Alan Dershowitz who has told me personally and on film to me you will see it in my movie with Adam Corolla no safe spaces next year\nThat said to me that he is far more afraid of the left than of the right\n... well listen to it and see he was all it took her ... she was like\nThis is the this is sexual McCarthyism right I mean think of it ladies and gentleman\nI Wonder if somebody had said he committed murder in high school\nWhether that would have been a hearing I doubt it you have any corroboration you have a dead body\nYou have witnesses no and no on all counts I'm Sorry murder is the worst thing that a person can engage in nevertheless we can stop the engines of government of the United states of America because one person makes one on corroborated charge of murder\nTell me where by analogy is by analogy ... an improper\nCoal may tell tell me you are listening tell me why this happened\nOn what grounds were the hearings held say this is what I this is what I said from the beginning I was attacked by conservatives or the Washington Post National Review and elsewhere and I maintain that my original position was correct\nAll these conservatives do\nUh is feed the beast yes look at what you can do to ruin a man's reputation man who hundreds of women of all backgrounds and of all political persuasion Z have affirmed it's such a decent man\n\nI I'm not sure that I have witnessed something like this in my lifetime and we've had this before with Clarence Thomas Clarence Thomas\n... who is still used as a poster boy for sexual harassment at worst she is accused of talking a mentioning sexual matters in a conversation a with a a was a would be if I needed help\nOr I I happen for the record and to think that it's unwise to do I have not done that and I'm not a proponent of it I but I think it means to be put in perspective\nI mean this is is it the statement of a woman cannot even here talk about sexual matters\nIt is so it is so devastating it is\nI don't think is a is a affirmative a female strength\nI don't defend it but I I'm Talking about how how awful is it in the perspective of the awfulness of the people are capable of\nProblem is in the United states of America things are so good for so many people in fact a exaggerated view\nOf sin takes place I don't mean religious and secular said\nWhat we are this is what we have witnessed though the closing down of the machine machinery of government they weren't willing to go to California\nThe entire Senate Judiciary committee are you aware of that that was their argument will come to you when she said she was afraid of flying they made an offer of going to her\n... many of our representatives of the committee or not the whole company or some very important to have some accuracy on this program but the one who how whatever the number they were willing to go to her\nAnd it is because we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism just as Alan Dershowitz put the issue\n\nBut I I don't think in real McCarthyism in the actual here in the Nineteen fifties I don't I don't know I I simply don't know I I ... this if one person had said about a Supreme Court nominee I Know he's he's pro communist\nThat's after all what the coffee is is charged with unfairly characterizing decent people as communists just like we have on fair charging of of people have sexual predators\nYou're not many left wing sites called him a serial rapist\n... I mean the the man the man must wake up and think how did how did this happen\n\nWhile they Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three or triple seven six\n\nWhat if this is my question to you and you should posed this too if if a if a anti Kevin our relatives or even willing to talk the remember they are ...\nPeople on the left I think that they are morally superior and therefore normal rules don't apply like the rules of truth the rules of evidence\nI Believe women is a statement that truce doesn't matter\nGender matters knocked evidence\nPeople go to college in graduate school will say I believe women\nReally I don't believe men just for the record I Believe [noise]\nEvidence [noise] but then again I'm not on the left I Am dead as Prager however [noise]\nThey'd like you to share your story that like you to email your representative your congressman or senator\nYou don't have to do any of that you could just go there and read what they are doing but this is an

going to be a big choice for Americans they're going to choose between the continued pro growth and job a policy that this administration or they can choose to see them rolled back and the tax cuts um

area of life let me give you a list right a list of\nAnd if I missed any I Would ask the two gentlemen with who I work to come up with something I missed or right now I'm by the way this is not an order of importance it solely an order of their appearance in my brain\nActually in my in my mind so for example health\nChildren parents spouse in other words marriage work by how many people\nCan say that in all of those areas of life they have been the recipient of great\nHappiness the answer is very few\nI was with somebody who has a spectacular life spectacular children in great health\nAnd a fair marriage affair marriage\nNot a bad marriage at all not a particularly good marriage and this person like him even say male or female this person or did I say great career as well do I mentioned that I don't think so children career health\nTerrific marriage fair and the answer\nIs with the person like a better marriage absolutely is the person basically happy you absolutely because you have to find happiness where you\nAnd that's the lesson of today's happy this hour and very few people\nFind it in all major arenas\n\nAll right that's that's you ... you don't like your job okay you have a good marriage All right so be happy\n\nWith the the ability to have happiness supplied\nAs it were by every major avenue is a rare warm for most people want any Prager\nSeven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six is the number if you take this seriously you can have a happier life\nIt just it just doesn't work out for everybody to have every major area a happiness producer\nSo your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work on being happy\nAnd I to me that's more amazing that people not working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's analogous\n\nYou know if if people do X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it because I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for a very few people those life deliver in all arenas\nOf life that's that's key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't good so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about and not not worthy of divorce\nUnderstands that there are other avenues oh excuse me I Can't believe it I Can't believe it I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've the punishment room is only earned for carelessness not for content but I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content should should apply anyway friends\nHow did I forget that one\nSo friends health marriage I said parents I ah\nI Know of course children I Know but I I'm thinking I it's the one includes parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life is all put parents and\nSo parents children friend's health work marriage there you go if you got him on all cylinders\nThat I mean that's like having an all wheel drive\nAnd be and I was thinking of a brand name but I don't want to push any particular brand mainly air but you know what I mean I mean that all wheel drive super luxury s._u._v.\n\nAlright that's it's not most people can't afford it or just don't have a one eight Prager seven seven six\nI like you to call in and I'll be see I have a question or obviously if you defer you know if you don't have one of those well the truth is if you don't have health that's a toughie I Would say of all of them that may be might might be the toughest but it depends what health means\nIf you if the health is debilitating or not for example Charles crowd hammer the wonderful late commentator you know it was paralyzed almost fully from the neck down that's bad health\nBut he he he was a fully functioning highly functioning more functioning that most people who are paralyzed [noise]\nIndividual who loved life [noise]\nAll right and everybody you've got to find happiness where you can and few people have it in all the ... of life that I mentioned [noise] you are listening to the happiness our second hour every Friday on the dentist Prager show\nThe dentist Prager show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nSo that makes sense\nAbsolutely it's a very good answer I think it [laughter]\nOh You're welcome thank you that's the best question answer\nGood or if I like that\nWhat if you do this is from triple ... what if you do with the other person in your life fails to realize this can you be happy\nWith someone who doesn't realize this he told me about a a a a love interest you're talking about a friend\n...\nWell I Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say your other spouse that isn't on board and in these matters such twice said then you still have the hopefully health friend's children parents\nOr work I'm remember or not and or to be sources of happiness [noise] this is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to ... I'm not kidding about how important this is\nAnd you can't that's why Julie's question was so important you can't beat this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I moved to ah to Baltimore oh well it was a bad choice how I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding don't be offended okay when I get married when I have children\nWhen my children are getting married when I Lived right right that's good when I lose this weight that's right yes there's always a wedding I'll be happy when you can't do I'll be happy when\n[laughter]\nThat that's the boys that all this time until when that happens is wasted\n\nAnd you don't know how much time you'll get anyway you know people die young\nJust for the record you don't you don't we don't have any guarantees you celebrate what you can now yes it's very important\nThe went issue ... people have that\nThat I have talked about but not as the women issue and I like that is the winner issue I really could do another happiness book\n[noise]\nBy I sit here and I do believe this is helping people that that gives me a ...

Dennis is that right promote cook Dennis half off [noise]\nAll right everybody\nThat's an interesting challenge to me that's a good one to San Antonio Gilbert Hi Venice Prager\nYard in San Antonio Texas hello Dennis Yes sir right talking to you thank you\nRobin the mail and I call whenever talking about we're not crowded because you've got the most important\nPart you know in God in your life no matter where you're at you'll never be happy\nTo be interesting question you know I'm a I Am an emphatic endorse or of God and religion as you probably know [noise] but I I have to be intellectually honest no matter that's number one God wants me to uh to worship him and truth\nSo ... so what you're saying is it's not possible for a secular person to be happy\nThat's correct yeah well not really happy yeah\nWill truly happy is an interesting adverb a I I don't know I don't know the answer to\nThat like I think look I I Believe that secularism has produced good government and nothing else everything else it's touched has been pretty much a disaster\nBut I it's hard it's hard let me take a look here you can be secular unhappy\nOkay so what exactly I think I think I\nWhat does guard and religion add I mean it's tremendously to one's happiness so maybe they can be happy but not at the same level that's the way I Would put\nAnd let's go to Tim in Rochester, Minnesota\nHello Dennis Hi ah\nI'm just wondering how you um you know if you ever feel ... you know I don't know about\nGuilty is the right word but you seem to hit the right note on a ... and all those\nCategories and I'm just wondering I mean you know I think it's easier how their happiness our I mean if if you are you know sort of been a successful and all those areas I Know that if I\nSuccessful in those areas I Would probably have the happiness our I'm On my show every every day I mean\nNow it's a yeah OK apple that okay it's a very important and difficult question because I I really do have to open up to you I of all most listeners of a long time you know I have not had a pain free life by any means\nI've been divorced and uh it was a very painful period in my life\nAnd if you only time in thirty five years of broadcasting where I had tears while broadcasting was when I announced the end of my marriage or my ah\nSeventeen years and I\nI went through a lot as a result of that or I mean it's not been a smooth road in my life I did not grow up a happy child I became happy in high school but before that I I was not happy\nSo in fact if I didn't have all of the pain that I've had I don't think I could do a happiness out so in the question has merit\nI think if you if you have everything that I listed with no glitches\nAnd I think about ten percent of the population does one out of ten people I think ... might well I don't think you could do what happiness Iran I think I could have written a happy this book I wrote the name of my book is it give away happiness is a serious problem\n\nI had all these things how can I write a book happiness is a serious problem I Would write a book happiness is effortless [laughter] that's what the book would have been [noise]\nSo uh what I Do however is I live by the words that I give you advice on you know very recently I took a terrible fall and hurt my eye and\nIt could have been a very serious and it it did a little bit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes indeed every body ... and the third our on friday Ninety four point\nEight percent of the time is exactly that's very rare that I don't just take calls on anything\nBy the way as I mentioned to you often I started radio doing exactly that people would call in on anything [noise] and there are a great advantages to that and great disadvantages to that as a regular to die\nBecause focusing on some issues during an hour or a few issues [noise]\nThese ultimately deeper but on the other hand you've got topics that you would never would otherwise have if you just have people call him [noise] so that's the story and let's go to your calls immediately Matty in Houston, Texas Hi Maddie Dennis Prager\nOkay Hi er my my ... well well\nWell congratulations that is very exciting I'm very I'm happy that you're excited\nSo I'll go go\nDo I have advice for you that is precious I could spend the next hour giving you advice [laughter] [noise] Ah yes I Do so ah yeah here goes I'm just putting you on hold there [noise] so what's the\nWhy does it mean to be a bar above ... ... is the Hebrew word for commandment it's translated often as good deed and many commandments are good deeds but it means commandment [noise] so let's take that seriously\nThe notion in Judaism is that a girl a twelve or a boy at Thirteen is now responsible for their own sins\nUntil now you did bad it was on your parents' record now it's on your record\nWhile one should be excited at their bar mitzvah one should be a little afraid to because now there's no protective shield between you and your morals record before God\nYou can't blame your parents as of tomorrow in fact parents say a prayer thanking God that they are now freed from from the moral record of their children\nI take that very seriously thought could seriously when I was your age I took it seriously as the as the parent of two book two boys who have permits for this so this is a spectacular notion\nI Am now responsible for my life it's the matter is the opposite of what is taught in America today to so many kids I'm not responsible for my life others are so that's that's a big one that you now take control of your moral life\nAnd does that make sense\nYeah oh for\nOkay thank you that's that's precious I'll give you another one the the on the word commandment do right I've said this often the biggest difference between my religious and I think Christians religious education and secular education in America today is this\nI was raised the I'll give you two differences I was raised obligation oriented kids today are raised rights oriented are you going to make a better human being whose preoccupied with his or her rights or his or her obligations\nI didn't hear the word rights 'til I got to college I ... I knew the word obligations throughout throughout my life\nOh by the way they give you a real power for example the uh uh Judaism and Christianity believed that the husband and wife have sexual obligations to the to their spouse\nYou say that today you're accused of advocating marital rape Huffington Post just accused me of marital rape second time I've been accused at least I Know of I'm sure it doesn't I don't know that this doesn't times but I mean the big places because I wrote an article ten years ago\nAt which I'm proud of and people should read it\nSaying that given the ... the importance of sex to a marriage if you love your husband\nAnd he loves you and he's a good man don't let mood alone determine whether you will have sex with him sometimes just have it because you love it that's called marital rape today\nThat I Believe that there are obligations I have obligations to my wife ... in in a whole host the berries and she has obligations to me in a whole host the various\nThe other difference between a religious education in a secular education I was told that the greatest problem in Dennis ... life is Dennis predator\nThat's a religious school Christian school Jewish school the\nBiggest issue when your life is you\nSecular school biggest issue in life is American society sexism racism is either phobia homophobia et cetera big difference say so those are my areas for Matty good luck\nWouldn't it be fun if I showed up just flew to Houston and showed up\nI just you have no idea that there was a part of me that would love to do that [laughter] I don't know if the rabbi would be happy [laughter] what\nA good though the let's see uh Andrew in Fort Worth high\n... very well thank you\nFor the question the guy for you would you rather be your or respected and why\nIt depends by whom\nGotcha that don't\nMean by fear that when I go since like I fear consequences for um ... my parents or my spouse\nI rather that America be feared than anything else so if there were times where respected I think that the I think if my children have no fear of me it wouldn't have been good that\nBut today at their ages in their twenties and thirties I don't I don't want them to fear me I don't I don't think that's that would be a good thing I Want them to respect me and love me\nBut uh when they're when they're eight I Would like them to fear me you'll like this Andrew I asked I did an hour once if you didn't do drugs when you were in high school or college or a say high school why not\nThe biggest the most common answer was because my mother would kill me\n\nThat's good I read or write Yes sir thank you very much appreciate your call\nGot a lot of young Cole was on the on the on the ... hour and on the male female and I'm a happy is very interesting though I have a theory on that or an\nOldie but for now but I remember I said I Would like America feared yeah I Do when America's fear there's more peace on earth\nIf you like a piece you want America feared if you are like war then you don't want America feared you just want America like any other nation that's why I said\nIf the Nobel Peace prize we're really awarded\nThose who deserve it the American armed forces would get the Nobel Peace prize the greatest force for peace on earth is American might\nBe OK okay man why do I have a feeling that the current president would agree with that and the previous president would not just a hunch okey dokey\nAnd we'll go to Cameron in Phoenix hello camera and all that that's how you doing real real well thank you happy\nFriday I got to have a word processor for yeah all all when you think the earth is\nWhat is it I think four point six billion years and the universe is what fourteen points something billion that's what I think\nWell and when he found a um [noise] people who can use like ... genesis and they say the earth is only a couple of thousand maybe six seven thousand years well\nI I just I Wish them a wonderful day I had\nA I don't I'm I told you what I Believe and I have no desire to argue with people who have they\nHave that view of the world they do with the world no harm [noise] uh uh I'm by I measure them by their goodness not by their building will be back I'm Dennis ...\nPrimary by the release your free\nThey they don't hurt the society for that belief they still give their kids to a polio shots and measles shots theyre not anti science\nSo uh that's that's I I don't it's not an argument is that I feel is critical I Believe I Believe that the first five books or indeed divide and that God is in the rest of the Bible\nBut I don't believe that it is it is a a battle worth fighting over the literal ... of the days of the six days of creation\nAnd a title my work on the Bible the rational Bible and I try to be true to the title reason tells me that it's billions of years old\nIt is not one ... less a miracle if God created the universe in six days or in six billion years what what is the difference\nAnd by the way the Bible of self says in ... a day in God's a ... a day in God's eyes is like three thousand is is like a thousand years okay thank you my friend and I really appreciate it means when semi Valley California you're the first mango I have ever spoken to\nWhat the ... or ...
