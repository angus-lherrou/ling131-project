A. G. E. triple eight nine seven one Seventy four three very older released acted are calm studio is Thursday we will be talking with Dr ... and just a few minutes we're going to ask you about this Washington Post journalist who apparently has been murdered\nChopped up be headed [noise] she is a Saudi national but legally residing in America has American born children [noise]\nGoing to find out about the investigation and whether or not the president is being duped by the Saudis who said that well the guy might have slipped on a bar so [noise]\n\nWe're talking with Sean steal the ex chair of the California Republican Party statewide polls showing that John Cox might be within a percentage points of his Democratic opponent [noise]\nWe're going to try to finally get to that story about Harvard being sued for alleged racial discrimination against Asians [noise] is the New York prosecution against Harvey Weinstein going south will talk about that\nAnd the executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and military vet forced to resign because he wrote on social media I stand for the flag I Neal for the cross I Do not catch you [noise]\nBut first [noise]\nThe coach of the [noise] San Antonio spurs great pop a bitch use the fifth anniversary of the black power salute remember that in sixty eight by Tommy Smith and John Carlos\n[noise] she's calling for politicians they have a more civil constructive conversation about race relations quote we're politician to our divisive with their disingenuous cynical approach that is disgusting\n\nAnd he goes on and on and on about his time for politicians to have a civil conversation about race relations [noise] now coach I Know you listen to the show I'm period in San Antonio appreciate the coverage\nYou're making things worse remember that poll that came out a few months ago that said that six out of ten Americans feel that race relations are getting worse in America [noise]\nBut then most of them never discuss the issue with their friends or family and I think about that\nRace relations are getting worse\nPeople agree that they're getting worse but they don't discuss it with friends or family\nThat would be something on the part of the people like ... that people are discussing it because it's such a sensitive topic because America still seeding racism the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow to block cetera\n[noise] let me tell you why people don't talk about it first of all most people don't think they are racist\nThey don't most people think they're fair most people think that they give people a and even shot most people consider themselves to be Christians and the whole basis of Christianity is the golden rule treating people that way you want to be treated most people think they do that so they don't think there is number two\nIf the great diversity is right and I am that racism is not a major problem in America anymore despite the fact that you feel things are getting worse doesn't mean it's a major problem is it ruining your day is a stop and you can going into a marketing ordering something if the person behind the counter happens to be a different race than yours of course not\nWe're getting along just fine here in this country [noise] the third reason people don't say anything you can you tell\nThe truth about how you feel and you're going to be called a racist or an Uncle Tom witness what's going on with Kanye West witness their retreat that Steve already had to give you a quick story buddy of mine just told me the other day he's in a bar my buddy is white everybody in the bar is white and it's a sports bar is normally there are sports things on TV for some reason with local news\nAnd they were doing a story about how a bunch of ... every year uh for for several days or lend their services for free to poor people are and they interviewed some woman happened to be black holding her baby and she was saying I my baby needs braces my baby needs braces and some white guy said what about your baby 's husband what about your baby's father\nAbout your husband what about your boyfriend where's eat\nAnd then some guy a table to over said hey that's racist and the guy to an argument\nAnd the guy said hey this race it eventually laugh because uh it was started to escalate to the point where who knows what might have happened so here you have all white guys one white guy saying out loud hey where's your where's the baby where's the father of your baby how can we can help you that's what he said how can the father of your baby can't help you still at least that\nPerfectly legitimate question he's called racist by another white guy\nSo the point is people don't talk once the upside I'm going to say how I feel it's going to be politically incorrect and next thing you know I'm a bigger around and local talk ideas aggressive racism is not a major problem in America and I'm Talking to somebody thinks it is what's the upside how am I going to prove it what what what am I supposed to say\nThat's why so coach you're not helping anything and Matthew is Chris Matthews expose the game listen to this is for white\nPeople because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist show of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way you get them off the hook you know what I'm saying\nNow Matthew is making two points although he doesn't realize that the first is\nMost people don't raise this sorry not\nSecondly since most white people will vote for somebody if they think they're racist if necessary for us to characterize it personally as racist your brand Reagan his races to brand George W Bush's races to brand Donald Trump is racist because most white people will vote for him to get in the heat races therefore we're going to characterize them as right that\nThat's the con she's just disposing it\nMost white people coach are not racist or your friends racist or you races or your friends' friends' races\nKnock it off\nNineteen Ninety seven time CNN poll poll black teenagers and why teenagers have talked about this before both were asked\nDo you think racism is a major problem in America more whites team started wasn't black teens\nBut then they asked this do you think racism is a big problem a major problem or a big problem a I'm a ... minor problem or no problem in your own daily large\nEighty nine percent of the black teens that racism was a miner or no problem in my daily life\nGrow up knock it off you gotta do three things get to the middle class coach you know this finished high school don't have a kid before you're twenty get married before you have kids you will not be poor regarding this business about a institutional racism and and structural racism and\nAnd uh uh what's the other word is ... structure Roland a systemic racism yeah\nHow about the police coach tell these young black men comply you will die\nVirtually all of these high profile cases would not have taken place had the individual slash suspect simply complied\nAnd his record is ruled even if the officer gives you an illegal order you must comply unless that illegal order your the company would force so you're not helping any anybody coach and the big problem coach isn't your leak look in the mirror for every player that does not have a kid outside of wedlock there's a player with to\nDo something about that that is the number one probably in the black community number one problem in the country forty percent of kids in this country are born outside of wedlock that is a massive problem Seventy three percent of black kids coach outside of wedlock that's the problem\nNot racism knock it off\nTo be talking with Dr ... just a second one of the things we talk about using the abduction and apparently the murder of this Washington Post reporter here's what Jake Tapper set about\nThis afternoon the president is denying he's giving cover in any way to the Saudis in this thing he definitely wants to find out what happened but that's about as top that the president was willing to get you had had\nHarsh words in the last week or so for Stormy Daniels Senator Elizabeth Warren and Taylor Swift that needed that the Saudis responsible for the likely butchering quarter of a Washington Post columnist and because\nYou see that's going I mean well um CNN's defense guy mud said this\nIs one football that's only half the bombshell here I mean the the really interesting part of this is an addition to the typical prosecutorial side of this as you report and the opening you were talking about a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will\nFrom going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein get the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation that Congress I bet it's going to turn around and say we want to see that in the Congress is going to lead there's going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictment I really want to see what's in that narrative report so\nWe're going to talk to Dr ... about CNN reporting that we may see more indictment from Robert Mueller and has the parent as president been dismissive about what's happened to the Washington Post journalist [noise] Hi I'm Larry Elder do not leave town\nOh they're all through all [noise]\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I'm I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time not a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't feel like that long ago\nIt wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and nail before the cross what it had been five\nMember this was a the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform remember that\nThere's a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive worthy executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your town in traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker said two years since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that is a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from many of them\nThat's a shocking what is the same to you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if ah there is room for moderate Democrats and the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered a racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward\n[noise] that's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWhen you're going to do\nWell um I'd like to continue to bring this to light and continue to voice concern for this very issue um and then in the short term um ironically my son is going in the air force than sixty days I'm going to spend some time with him and and the and I will continue to fight them pause as long as I can and continue to clear my name\n[noise] God Bless and let let me just say again I'm not in support of the Democratic party but I Hope you stay in that party 'cause I think it needs normal people thank you I Hope you are my luck thanks very much for sharing that the shocking\nStory appreciate it thank you for me to normal people when we come back we're going to talk about the apparent murder the Washington Post journalist Larry\nTo see on the news talking nine Ninety ...
