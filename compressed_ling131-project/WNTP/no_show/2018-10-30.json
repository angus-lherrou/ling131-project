H. G. E. L. or are there on the Twitter account at Mark Davis follow me there and we should be stuff they all take a look at the\nVarious things during the during the commercial breaks and as I say that's another whole show that takes place over there but the one that involves um pasta in close proximity is right here and do our phone lines are open for you and I've got some questions for you\nObviously plenty of things to say but I always couch them in questions for you before I Begin asking you what you think about some things I'm In a time when so little unifies us I think when we were lashed together on Thursday here\nOn the Larry Elder show I think I went through my usual speech about how unity as for the birds common ground is a is a mess and in fact we are a better people we are a better government we are a better society when everybody just\nIt is true to their beliefs let the conservatives be conservative and fight for conservative things that the liberals be liberal and fight for liberal things were going to have winters to win losers who loses what the election is about the week from tomorrow the winters are going to win the losers are going to lose and I've been preaching that conservatives for years\nI don't think you're going to win by trying to reach out to the left 'cause all they're going to do is bite your hand off because they ain't reaching out to us\nAnd nor should pay the left should be left if their ideas prevail good for them not so good for the country in my view but the the obvious common ground unity come by on nonsense\nI is in terms of policy it is ridiculous but I offer that\nAn on ramp to the following varies a short list of things that unify all of us under the umbrella of our humanity or at least should I Wish it were all of us are but there is a a a little tiny sliver of a subsection of of humanity in its steamy underbelly [noise]\nThat uh that does things like what we have seen in\nPittsburgh and so before we dive in and talk about Pittsburgh before we dive in talk about the the media reaction and political reactions to Pittsburgh let us just pause and do the most important thing we can do as Americans as people\nAnd that is lift up those last people in prayer let us lift up the soles of those who are shot by this this this monster\nTheir their families their friends their\nFaith community there at the tree of life synagogue it is it is probably if it is sad\nThat it takes thing the only things like this truly unify us but this is not a a policy battle this is not a left versus right thing this is a good versus evil thing\nNow in a minute now you will hear people say that that in their take on good versus evil they consider the president of the United states to be evil man that I'll have a word or two to say about those people but before we before we had down for those various rabbit trails of talk show land [noise]\nUm let us just no matter what we are doing\nRight now where I Am here in central time it's a little after five in the sun is shining it's beautiful warm Texas day\nMaybe you're a little bit into your commute on the east coast may be a beautiful vistas of mountain time it's late afternoon and you're enjoying whatever you're doing it out on the west coast and not into\nAn elder country of Los Angeles and various other affiliates in California where it's a little bit after three it's the middle the afternoon some Monday and maybe you've come through a weekend filled with blessings filled with faith and failed his family at least that certainly my hope for you [noise]\nThis is exactly what these folks thought as they walked into the synagogue on Saturday morning\nI've heard a lot of people say that the one victim they can't get out of their heads as the Ninety seven year old woman and I buy confessed to that myself that any one life is is worth more than any other or like who that was really bad I mean they're all bad it's all terribly there's all heart rending\nBut if you're Ninety seven you saw the Holocaust\nFirst hand a lot of people who are Ninety seven are Holocaust survivors and they were dwindling generation we should cherish them while they're here\nAnd the notion of somebody surviving that time when we had a global force in the Nazis coups goals included eradication of the Jews\nTo defeat the third right to win World War two\nTo ... seed decades of further\nOne would hope enlightenment a surround the world and to have that horror be increasingly distant memory but a memory we keep alive there's a reason those words never forget are so important never never forget it's not like this was thousands of\nYears ago with all kinds of brutality were common it's not like it was the rough few in time and you know just a few centuries ago the kind of world gave birth thank God to the United states of America this is when this what this was the thirties and forties for crying out loud we have people walking around alive who who were ...\nTeenagers and young adults from that time and this this this wonderful woman was one of them for her to survive all of this only to take a bullet in the safety of her synagogue in in in Pittsburgh in October of twenty Eighteen are you kidding me\nWell no we're ah we're ... we're not kidding [noise] there are people who are in this twist it there is\nHatred there is anti Semitism there is racism and massage any and all of these these behaviors that are uh that that are the\nDevil at work and are a lot [noise] uh how many such people are there I don't know if it's not many at all but it doesn't take many this only took one\nI I Am not comforted by the fact that it's a tiny sliver of humanity that that dives to this death ... the fact that you don't want us to many the fact that the any human being can spew this kind of nonsense of ... about the June ... I mean other than any\nType of hatred makes more or less sense than than the other there are some people who hate other people you know because of skin color others who have other people because of religion and others who have other people for a wide variety of reasons\nAnd ... and ... and it's pathetic\nAnd all good people you might a segment where he talked a lot about division in unity all good people unite to to mourn to lift up these people these victims\nThese beautiful souls in that Senate God we lift them up we celebrate ... they're welcoming into the arms of a loving God and we keep their families and that community there and squirrel hill and all of Pittsburgh we keep them in our thoughts and prayers and and our our best thoughts as we move forward\nAs we do move forward it is time to take a look at the sorry tawdry bottom feeding that happened as people politicized that oh you're going to hear\nSome of that and then you're going to hear about some of that from me and I'd like to hear about some of that from you we may not agree on everything that's fine that's why we have phone lines eight eight eight nine seven one said Mark Davis in for Larry Elder very very glad you're here on this Monday is going to be an important show\nVery blessed to be here with your your at back all through all\nPittsburgh synagogue shooter\nWas somehow bird to action by the president warnings\nAbout the Caribbean\nThe thousands of people who are headed our way in order to intentionally violate our borders that a president who is a vigilant about that\nHe was somehow set the stage for this kind of a reaction I mean how low will these folks go and and and I think the answer is in why does the author\nWho stays training I mean why is the author very very\nFirst thing that the president didn't first condemned the attack soak in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts\nYou can't start cutting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime is delivered on the promises he made and if anything I think is sad I N device that the way that every single thing that comes out of the media Ninety percent of what comes out of the media cloud negative about this president\nAmen amen and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged down\nAs you hear a word for word and page after page and speech after speech about how our our ability to get along just kind of been thrown into the toilet\nAbout our level of discourse incivility is all kind of dashed against the rocks an observation that you certainly can make is it because Trump won or because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp elbows and a\nSalty thing that he might have said it some rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nReason our discourse has been dragged into the muck is the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that he won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive\nAnd this this is nothing\nNew but the level of hatred that's how you know the change is real by the way the level of vitriol the level of bend them\nWhen you have an entire dominant media culture walked around saying the president is racist the president is I hate her\nOut in the world that how do you think Thanksgiving is going to be a good idea I think your Facebook exchanges are going to go so All right Mark Davis singer Larry Elder morning nominate right on the phones what are you an eight eight nine seven on stage stick around\nAll across America at all wearing\nShoes\nTo our time I've used talking nine Ninety dot com [noise]\nThis er and ... and I've had for ... hours who carried out what is believed to be the deadliest attack on issues and us history killing a loving people and injuring several others appeared in court Monday attorney general Jeff Sessions says what happened in Pittsburgh was not just an attack on the Jewish people\nBy the attack on people's ball face the Pentagon says it ascending fifty two hundred troops to the U.S Mexico border President Trump has put a sharp focus on Central American migrants traveling north and slow moving caravans\nThat are still hundreds of miles from the U.S strong but the earthquake struck ...
