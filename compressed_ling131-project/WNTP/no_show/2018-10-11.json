Bush admitting they were unfair to Mitt Romney but my goodness this guy Trump is a real problem no what you don't understand bill Marr is you guys created the real problem Donald Trump\nThe young people yes please Clinton because you know like really young like they say in the action movies that just got real yeah I Know you're young and idealistic so I've\nHeard he's referring to the election of Donald Trump the blank just got real oh my goodness\nThese young people on the news and they say things like Well Donald Trump I don't like them but Hillary I Can't vote for a liar\nI mean first of all it's just apples and oranges an orange um [noise] kids I've been doing this for twenty three years into the I've seen a lot I Know politics and this is different\nI promise you this will not make your life better and also once the ashes get power they don't give it up\nYou've got closer than from for life [noise] I Know liberal\nPresident Trump is a fascist we have I'm from I listen to this listen to this is what's important\nBowls made a big mistake because we attacked here boy Bush what\nHave you back this up so you stepped on it he says to a David Frum who's a Republican one of the panelists I\nKnow we were unfair to Europe boy Bush we attack them\nFor a live [noise] I Know liberals made a big mistake because we attacked here boy Bush like he was the end of the world and he wasn't and Mitt Romney we attack that way I gave a bottle a million dollars because or greater Mitt\nRomney Mitt Romney wouldn't it changed my life that much or you know it was absolutely for John McCain they were honorable men are we disagreed with him he should have kept it that way so we cried wolf and that was wrong but this Israel yeah this is going to be way different but I don't understand why did you hear that\nYou're that liberals\nWe were unfair to George W. Bush we were unfair to Mitt Romney liberals ... I mean how about you\nYou perform so poorly I'm surprised you haven't given us\nThis is bill more going around about George W. Bush\nFor farm so poorly I'm surprised you haven't given yourself a metal [noise] your pastor ... walks like a man [noise] Herbert Hoover was the\nPresident but I have and have never seen it an entire metropolis to rising water and snake [noise] on your watch we've lost almost all of our allies the surplus for airliners to Trade Center is a piece of the Pentagon and the city of New Orleans\nTo trade centers I mean honestly this is what\nBill Maher said here you're saying hey we're fair liberals including me how 'bout you what you said about Mitt Romney Maher\nOr Mitt Romney has to start understanding why people don't like him it's not because he's rich it's how we got rich\nNow here's some other rich guys here's Henry Ford with is modeled the Walt Disney with an early cartoon idea jobs and Wozniak with their first desktop now here's Mitt and his partners in vain starring in Snow White and the seven basis [noise]\n\nMaking reference to the race of the business partners that Romney's and because it's open season on white men if\nThere was the first three have that myth doesn't a product [noise] something they made besides money [noise] you know venture capitalists are not creators their businessmen who find we'd companies and pray on them\n[noise] so that's what Bill Maher said about Mitt Romney you'd make his own money honestly in fairly early did was coined other people or what he said about George W. Bush presidency is a catastrophe\nAnd now he's saying you know with liberals we were unfair to George W. Bush we were unfair to Mitt Romney but this guy Donald Trump I tell you what\nIt is because you were unfair to people like George W. Bush bill is because you were unfair to people like Bill Ron Mitt Romney that we needed a Donald Trump\nThe young people yes please Clinton because you know like really young like they say in the action movies that just got real yeah I Know you're young and idealistic\nSo I've heard these young people on the news and they say things like Well Donald Trump I don't like him but Hillary I Can't vote for a liar\nI mean first of all it's just apples and oranges an orange um kids I've been doing this for twenty three years into the I've seen a lot I Know politics this is different\nI promise you this will not make your life better and also once bashes get power they don't give it up\nYou got it in from for life [noise] I Know liberate us made a big mistake because we attacked here boy Bush like he was the end of the world and he wasn't and Mitt Romney we attack that way I did a bottle a million dollars because don't greater Mitt Romney Mitt Romney wouldn't it changed my life that much or [noise]\nBut you're not attacking Donald Trump by calling him a fascist he's apologizing for attacking Romney apologizing for attacking Bush and then promptly called Donald Trump fashion [noise]\nTwo to five to\nLater on we are going to talk about the laws that the governor of California has signed allowing a whole bunch of people prisoners including violent prisoners to get out\nAnd the reason is because of quote prison overcrowding political that's right we have enough money to build a bullet train we have enough money to have single payer which is what the a\nDemocratic candidate for governor wants to do [noise] we don't have enough money to build prisoners to keep bad people behind bars for the duration of their sentences no matter how much money cost taxpayers when these people are out\nPutting bad people behind bars is a bargain considering these small percentage of people commit a great deal of crime putting in behind bars longer means that we actually save money over the long haul\nAnd a Fresno County da ... finally spoken out publicly against these stupid laws were going to have their forty later on the show triple eight nine seven one S. A. G. you want to say one more thing about\nBill more before I get to Heidi Heitkamp\nWho says the reasons he voted against Brett Kavanaugh is because she turned to sound down to look at his body language and then like what you saw\nI Know I Know\nBack to Bill Maher bill Marr says fascist are for life actually bill there was an election you said you've been doing this twenty three years you know a great deal about politics than you know that we have an amendment that limits the president's term to two terms\nAnd these are elections in every four years we have an election and after your second term full term\nYou leave Obama left Reagan left the leaf and a fascist\nBy definition if not somebody who cares about electoral politics so I really\nAnd then this rent you did on how the

ground so all I'm saying is but for people with money like Mitt Romney companies like apple would never would not have been founded would not have flourished just do something to think about since you know so much about politics maybe you should learn a little bit about capitalism\nThe young people yes please because you know like really young like they say in the action movies that just got real yeah I Know you're young and idealistic so I've heard these young people on the news and they say things like Well Donald Trump I don't like him but Hillary I Can't vote for a liar\nI mean first of
