years\nAnd I'm just thinking this through so stay with me here\nFor the last ten years I looked at myself as a black person which means I have therefore fail to benefit from the white privilege that I was in title too\nSo it seemed to me there ought to be some sort of reparations for black people who have more white blood white ancestry in them that Elizabeth Warren has a Native American Cherokee and Delaware and her and therefore I'm old all of the lack of my having benefited from white privilege for all these years\nSince white people all benefit from white privilege that seems to me the
