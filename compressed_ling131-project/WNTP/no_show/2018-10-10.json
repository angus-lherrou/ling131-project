appealing from overly\nWait wait wait that's my point ... wait wait forgive me that's what people would like they would they would like single payer for all I I I Would be very interested to see if we took a national vote only on that question would you like to nationalized healthcare everyone is covered and doesn't have to pay dues\nWould just take it out of ... people now are forced to want that because the health insurance premiums had double double right oh\nNo no no All right so you have no no no no no I hear what you're saying so you have very articulate spokespeople on the other side saying folks don't vote for that your premiums will go down if we have medicine the same way we have food and everything else competitively priced\nSo we will have articulate people argue I I hear you perfectly\nThey'll say no no no don't worry you will have premiums obviously because it's going to be a private insurance market\nAnd then the other side will say folks don't you just want to be taken
