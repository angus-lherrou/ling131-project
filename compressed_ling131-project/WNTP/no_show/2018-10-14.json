significant\nNo one was a righteous man\nIn fact there are a number of people who were just saying this is the end of the republic as we know it is the beginning of a new civil war\nHave already been announced intentions by a whole host of organizations and some leaders in Congress on the Democratic side\nThat as soon as they take control of the house of representatives so says representative Jerrold Nadler who is a very very very liberal Democrat from Manhattan\nA representative ... says he's going to be the new chair of the Judiciary Committee of the Democrats take over and one of his first orders of business in fact his first order of business will be a full investigation and impeachment\nOf justice Brett Kavanaugh good idea you look forward to that of course they also wanted to investigate President Trump or on the grounds of impeachment does have been going on for a while look if you voted democratic in these upcoming elections\nYou're voting for this insanity to continue\nIs it good for the country what do you hope to accomplish when I'm Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday was officially confirmed by a vote in the U.S Senate of fifty to forty eight\nIt actually would have been fifty one to forty nine except senator Steve Danes of a North Dakota\n... wanted to participate in his daughter's wedding and look as somebody who last may participated in my own daughter's wedding arrow daughter's wedding I understand how the senator felt and Senator Murkowski who voted wrong on Kavanaugh in my opinion\nI was very gracious and saying look she will keep it so that it will be shown that I'm Brett Kavanaugh actually passed with a to vote margin the final vote would have been fifty one forty nine as it was it was fifty to forty eight because she just voted present alright fine um [noise]\nThis is what it sounded like when Mike Pence announced the final vote he of course as vice president presides over the U.S Senate listen\n[noise] to sergeant at arm's will

[noise]\nSergeant their arms stored or in the gallery [noise]\nLarge ended arm restore order and the gallery [noise]\nOkay um what what is it that the folks are screaming about and what are they aiming to achieve what's fascinating to me about this\nIs remembered that dramatic Thursday it seems like another era where you had testimony from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you hadn't testimony from Brett Kavanaugh very very high profile everyone was watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any\nThere weren't whether Germany nobody nobody knows that now somehow they were able for that to control these idiots and I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that are are idiots indeed\nHonestly if they can control it in a high profile situation that shooting troll it every day\nThis is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic that people should be able to come on and into the galleries and screaming shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is really prosecuting these people\nAnd I'm making them feel the disrupting Congress when doing its job and by the way\nI Would include all of the conservative demonstrators who do that kind of thing as well why do I say that because there are not I'm not some conservatives do what can you think of the last time\nThat some right winger interrupted a the\nProceedings of a Senate committee or the Senate and session making important decision like confirming a springboard justice of\nThe Huffington Post put together a collage of some of the truly eloquent inspiring voices that had been raised against the Kavanaugh's confirmation [noise]\nUm [noise] we stand with Dr born we stand with survivors believe this country is facing\n\n\nOkay uh throw them out because and this is going to help why actually I Love it and I'm Glad to give it a tension and by the way let's a link to some of that that footage just really wonderful to watch and I I Need to describe it to\nA group of demonstrators came up to the doors to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court building in the United states in Washington DC it's a wonderful building and that Greek temples style all based upon the parts\nOn an Athens and classics because again the founders of our country identified with the creators\nOf Greek and Roman law they did I Know more white males though again there are people and African studies departments who claim the ancient Greeks were really not white but leave that aside um meanwhile these\nFolks came up to the doors of the Supreme Court building and the doors are those heavy metal doors that with carvings on them and big handles\nAnd so a group of demonstrators came up to the doors Supreme Court building banging on them literally budding their heads against them screaming shouting and sounding like this\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWhat is the [noise]\nWhat is the the clear message here that we're supposed to be getting I Will tell you I think there's a clear message is overwhelming was clear if you think this stuff is good for our country and then of course you want to vote democratic coming up a month from\nNow you you do because the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know and\nUh and basically some of the Democrats on the Senate floor wait to hear Cory Booker Spartacus\nOr who really has jumped the shark I mean it's it's just if this is your hysteria\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh you think he's talking about ... you think he's talking about uh uh he even analogize is the ah the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty or some salt on the individuals who are expressing their opposition to Brett Kavanaugh I I mean what are we talking about here\nWhy is this appropriate they they of course had a song or what would be a liberal occasion I'll let you actually go to the one of the protest from Saturday immediately after the vote it sounded like this [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] that's right [noise] so do not take this today la [noise]\nWhich is not surprising\nGet fresh outrage\nDismay I think it's a sad day for our country\nOkay it is a sad day for our country when you don't have both parties are\nCalling enough on that [noise] I I mean honestly why would anyone vote democratic [noise] unless you want this stuff to continue and if you do tell me why one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n[noise] your outlet for outrage it's outrageous what's going on out here the Michael ... is\nI'm like I I'm really disappointed I cannot believe you actually compared to get a ... one one was actually accused of sexually sexual I felt gotten didn't but then I use of anything so\nI Know and that's the guy who they are buying ... wait wait and that's exactly the\nPoint and there was that he wasn't accused of anything he wasn't called the radical he wasn't he wasn't cold heartless Merrick Garland\nA basically they postponed I'm\nConsidering his appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nAnd nothing about the fact of the matter is actually the woman who actually accused of sexual or a a a felt\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important\nThat um there was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing\nInvolving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no ex wives there wasn't enough thing a clean record until literally\nAfter his hearing had concluded and then they threw a Hail Mary pass and thought they'd make some hay with this one which is totally uncorroborated\nExcuse me you are not there so you can\nI say it is totally on robbery did you write I wasn't there but what what is it that you think should this be the new standard now I'm going to\nTell you exactly what we should have done okay we should have done it so investigation fairly it's not a reason for us run the rush or a lifetime appointment with all due respect we should have just white ... and do an investigation investigation and then if I actually done this or not\nOkay again again if there was any available evidence to confirm any aspect of Christine Blasey Ford story even the existence of this party the witnesses that she named\nSaid they have no recollection of central party they don't remember it she didn't tell anybody until Thirty years later\nThe the entire thing the whole idea that that well there were charges by within those charges clearly were manufactured in by the way there\nWas an important piece and it's a piece not by someone who's on the rights of someone who's on the left [noise] or a writer for the wall Street Journal named awestruck you know money who identifies herself as somebody who is on the left who was unhappy with the Kavanaugh appointment [noise]\nWhich you know what [noise] the
