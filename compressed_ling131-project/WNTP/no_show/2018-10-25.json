important that you know that I mean Richard lens in was the dean of climatologists at MIT in the country\nAnd she takes issue with the proposition that the the there are three propositions to the

we got a very very live an important show for you are coming up uh over the next three hours yeah one hour from now [noise]\nI'm very much looking forward to hearing from my my friend Kurt shorter\nPerch liquor is a town hall senior columnist or at home all the time he was also the author of a brand new book called militant normal and he\nPulls no punches\nHe takes no prisoners whether we're talking about ... coming from Central America or whether we're talking about pipe bombs or fully pipe bombs or suspicious packages or whatever it is that you want to call them\nHe is ready to go hard core so perch liquor will be joining me about one hour from now the top of our number two so if you are settled in and able to listen wherever you might be\nYou're going to want to hear that conversation also I've got conversation scheduled for the broadcast a today slashed tonight uh with some pretty important in a press of people are ... listen I sat in force Hugh Hewitt on his Salem Radio show this morning\nSo I did his program and as part of that regular schedule um I got an opportunity to speak with an MSNBC liberal anchor slash host\nUh my name is Stephanie rural you probably know about her you've probably heard clips played from her and all of her I got a chance to talk to her to say that it was\nMm entertaining\nI think was an understatement enough so that I feel like replaying it for you it's only about five minutes long that's how much time they have on the morning drop clock but I Want you to hear from stepping in rural just to get a feel for what the liberal point of view is as it pertains to President Trump and his supporters headed into these midterm elections\nBecause the president can't say anything without the liberals adding words to his statements in order to make them sound offensive\nAnd you know exactly what I'm Talking about the left going crazy about the president two nights ago speaking in Houston, Texas on behalf of Senator Ted Cruz at a sold out Toyota sold out packed jam packed Toyotas center with thousands of more people outside\nThe president declared he's a nationalist that is a dog whistle we're told that is an absolute state minutes a call it's code coded language to the base saying I'm with you white supremacist wow and what\nYeah I'm going to talk about that we're going to I'm gonna play back for you\nThe conversation that I had with Stephanie rural wells are going to talk about what nationalism really means with where he just some uh who is a very impressed the person he was a a close senior advisor national barrage when uh the Brexit was decided\nAh we're in England or in Europe rather a when Great Britain decided to essentially remove itself from\nAh do you and you know what that is that as an actor of\nNationalism we're gonna talk to ... to ... uh and then also as it pertains to the ongoing and ever marching inexorably\nToward the southern border the United states the northern border of Mexico that Central American caravan now believed to be some fourteen thousand strong [noise]\nAh what does it mean for the United states on what can we do to stop\nWhat I think most of us would agree is an invasion is not a migration it is an invasion RJ home and is the director of governmental affairs for fair the federation for American immigration reform still got that coming up next our show also a lot of really good people to talk to including ... ... ... a reply\nStep in rural from a conversation that I had with her earlier today but the lead story of course we have to get into is who is sending explosive well potentially explosive devices to prominent Democrats in New York and in Washington DC the\nHomes of George Soros or the Clintons Brock Obama and others apparently have been targeted for these suspicious packages let's get a little check your of the news on this from Fox\nBy the latest tallies sticks packages were confirmed for at three in New York at the home of billionaire George Soros on Monday and today is CNN and want to dress to the home of bill and Hillary Clinton in ... for which Mrs Clinton at a campaign stop in Florida thanked Secret Service who intercepted\nAnd dress she lived long before it made its way to our homes another was addressed to the Obamas in Washington and also to Florida in Maryland for Democrats five packages were cleared three in California and one received by New York's governor\nSo this of course all happening less than two weeks before the midterm elections and uh right now as you can imagine the finger of blame is being pointed\nIt's being pointed by the American left by which I mean elected Democrats\nMembers of Democrat activist groups members of the DNC and members of the Democratic controlled media which is to say virtually all media that isn't conservative talk radio when maybe that Fox News report\nThe finger of blame is being portrayed squarely at Donald Trump and Donald Trump's psychotic supporters\n[noise]\nIt is um an astounding thing uh hypocrisy when you see and hear these kinds of things\nWhen\nSteve skull lease was nearly murdered on a baseball field\nNot too terribly long to do\nWhat Eighteen months ago someone that neighbor was ... was nearly murdered and when an entire softball field or a baseball field\nFull of Republican elected officials congressional members practicing for baseball game were attacked by what we came to find out to be a radical extremist Bernie Sanders socialist who wanted to murder as many Republicans as possible\nDo you recall what the Democrats said\nDo not point the finger of blame at Democrats for these psychotic actions of somebody who happened to support one of us\nYou can't put blood on our hands because one not we didn't tell him to do that we didn't tell him to to try to murder people that's not on us right this is what they said very loudly very clearly and very repeatedly\nNow those very same Democrats who said you can't blame 'em his politics for his decision to try to commit mass murder on Republican members of Congress on a baseball field\nYou can't blame his politics are now saying you must blamed the politics of people we don't even know\nWe have no earthly idea at this point in time\nWho sent delivered made fabricated or whatever any of these could be would be might be potentially explosive devices and sent them to Soros CNN the Clintons and the Obamas\nWe have no idea but with I don't know who it is\nThey are ready to say it's Trump's fault\nAddicts Trump supporters fault because President Trump doesn't like the media President Trump demonize is the media especially CNN and therefore his followers are carrying out what he wants to have done to them\nThat is exactly what they're spending their time doing meanwhile there are others myself included\nAsking for at least a modicum of patience asking for just an idea\nJust give us at least a hint of an idea of who this is before we start ascribing motive and blame because there were a lot of people who ... suspect that this close to the mid term elections that this is a false flag and these are things being done by liberals to try to embarrass and to try to hold with conservatives\nIn Trump supporters accountable for this with lots of digest here we want you to be a part of the show triple eight nine seven one stage that strip late nine seven ... seven to for three about friends in Fort Larry Elder of many of them\nWants to not care about our country so [noise]\n\nSub [noise] president of\nThe United states could not have been more clear in defining\nWhat he meant he said between globalism which is being more concerned about the people of the globe then you are about the people in your own country versus nationalism which is putting our people first the people that elected me\nAnd then I'll deal with the rest of the globe second between those two I'm a nationalist\nThat is exactly what President Trump said and what did the left here well Jim Acosta tells you what the left her\nJust rather than just a follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national\n[noise] it's like Jim Acosta the grandstanding glory hounding attention grabbing photo journalist for CNN and he really is she is a phony journalist he is just about as bad as it gets\nAnd this is a nation that produce Dan Rather Jim Acosta\nIs playing the role of Google auto fill right you ever going to Google\nAnd you start searching for something in fact the first few letters of what your what what you want and then it says do you mean blank\nRyan\nYou type in you type in the law\nAnd as you're typing L. A. W. or do you mean lawnmower no I actually wanted to talk about the law I Want to search for something about the law about asylum in the United states why are you giving me law\nHere still Acosta he's Google auto fill President Trump I'm a nationalist Jim Acosta do you mean white nationalist how'd you get white nationalism out of a very simple definition of globalism\nCompared to nationalism because they hear what they want to hear and they hear what they want to smear keep that in mind\nThat is their goal especially as we head to the ... the president as popular as he's ever been forty seven percent approval rating according to NBC and the wall Street Journal poll\nAnd they are scared to death of what that means at the midterms and that's why they're going to continue to play these
