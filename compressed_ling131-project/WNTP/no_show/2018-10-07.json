Sanders the next hour revealed with issues our [noise] oh it\nGoes too fast everything goes too fast you hear about this Georgetown professor seek Christine fair\nTweeted over the weekend quote entitled white man's should have their corpses castrated and then fed to pigs [noise] fair and associate professor in Georgetown security studies program tweeted\nLook at the bus instrument this I guess chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapists aggregated been titled\n\nSerial rapist vile woman all of them deserve miserable death that's the the white senators\nLeases there she tweeted this out\nAll of them deserve miserable death small feminists laugh as they take their last guest or it could this is why he says feminism is killing society this woman is an example what's the name of the course again needs Coney feminism it's of course this week a trigger you\nI Do want to put out there for everybody\nFor everybody yes we're going to be talking a little bit about this a new attack on President Trump\nWill get a response on that the new attack which is really an old attack\nAbout President Trump dodging\nTaxes and he isn't really a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well research in the New York times so what is the relevance of this right now\nIt's obviously an attempt to tilt the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore a advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that and about the progress on trade\nWhere there's been great progress in the markets love it we've had this week uh the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing um why is that happening\nWe'll talk with us even more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox\nNews his new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward President Trump\nBut the question for Juan Williams will be what about the evidence and there's lots of it that there is at least in increasing open mindedness to the Republican message from African Americans we will get to that as well on the ... show but first\nI just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective is as people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season and actually\nI Want to thank Mark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job and are\nHelping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is uh basically it's almost a month long of one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful this one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York\nUm and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family began in ... but also because on this whole Kavanaugh matter\nI I was able to see a little bit of perspective and let me just tell you something that happened which I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue and a a and normally I talked to my friends\nI I was approached by a little kid and when I say a little\nKid and ten eleven years old\nAnd I'm ... and he asked that I'm not even sure if we want it you know as with the car is a hundred people there and [noise] anyway so the kid comes up to me\nAnd he says I I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice at somebody a Thirty Years' ago\nWhite plains that a big deal and I had not yet seen\nThe story about the alleged bar fight and one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale and then I later in the horrors of ice throwing\nAnd somehow it this is now reaching ... kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is\nA is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that it's okay to throw wise or\nNot that it's okay to be under age in a bar find them cetera et cetera no one uh was damaged or charged or arrested in this a bar if they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay this\nWhole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and girls in campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing is powerfully helping Republicans\nAnd I believe for one very simple reason if you like everything we've gone through with Kevin on four in the back in the forest\nAnd the punching and the pushing and the nastiness and then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm\nA Kavanaugh was not arrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up the bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw whites\nAnd a ... again I think it's more relevant to the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement I mean it was anything is more relevant\nThan the idea that Brett Kavanaugh when he was at Yale I'm I\nWas a member of a hard drinking fraternity ... the whole idea that this is significant and that is worthy of our attention this is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail\nOf people's passed to try to smear them and destroying them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat men sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you'll get in fact a Gerald nab blur\nThe radical from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already talked about impeaching justice Kavanaugh after he is\nConfirmed if you think that's where politics should go\nThen first of all tell me why secondly if you are almost sure to vote Democrat anyway if you do want to change your view on politics that is a little bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more\nAbout results rather than just\nDestroying the enemy and results for the American people more days where the stock market is there's a more days where people are working where people get raises\nI mean across the board it's happening now and ah and meanwhile\nWhat what's the focus was the focus is on on President Trump not mocking but daring to question a Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd he did it at a rally last night and President Trump is on button and rallies and others wasn't on his speech but first of all people say well he ... he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony here was the president of the United states and what he had to say\nI Want to write I Wonder [noise]\nWell do you think it was I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't know\n[noise] what\nWas it and I don't know\nI'm sure as well I don't know what I that's the only thing are in [noise]\nAnd I\nWas visiting Saturn a mass life is shattered\nOkay um [noise] look at ... is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do it didn't do it but is it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question\nJudge Kavanaugh one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the I'm Sarah Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this is the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about\nChristine Bugsy forward and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders\nWhy does the president said was he loves the reasons he says the\nPresident was dating the facts I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel missiles reports he was stating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nOn whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified I hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations\nThat have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous this entire process has been in disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrats didn't do this the way that it should have been damaged and they circumventing the entire system and frankly they undermine in our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted\nIn inappropriate and this was which they've conducted themselves\nOkay I I Believe is with that in mind that\nCertainly the Republican base\nPeople who voted and put President Trump in the White House met bases getting engaged and that's a good thing there's other reasons for having to do with the economy will speak with us Stephen Moore are coming up about the future of the economy and its political impact coming\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... ... how many ... march thirteenth ... thousand yeah it was it ... I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing\nI had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on the first point I made was wait a minute\nThis was like you know turning on the TV and saying you know with a hundred times you know friends\nEpisode rerun you know that you've already seen twenty times how many times with the New York times run the story I I ... I worked on the campaign they must won three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they went one last year and now the running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of this movie before the second point I made us look they're alleging kept fraud tax there was a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance which any good businessman\nThem any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of actually after you got the most I'm Out there was a shock to me\nThat's avoidance and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax fraud went a lot of these like I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last ... years has been funded by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't she release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason they're campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent uh correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump\nReleased his tax reforms I advised Trump among many other people during the campaign to not do not release your tax ... because if you think this report which were Thirteen or they they did Thirteen thousand words they don't even have you know a lot of the tax documents there's\nA man who has you know we're house was\nFull of ... tax document through all the businesses he's\nRunning through the ...\nAnd all this I mean I I I just think it would be a Pandora's box\nOkay uh and and don't file your taxes in a Pandora's box that Stephen Moore\nWho is a distinguished visiting fellow in the project for economic growth at the Heritage Foundation [noise] so what does this mean politically with a campaign coming up an intense finally get to that and more on them eventually [noise]\n\nHe was starting to do more intelligent conservative dark [noise]\nKavanaugh's been sworn in as the new Supreme Court justice at a quiet private ceremony not long after the narrow Senate confirmation and nearly a century now\nEven as he took the oath of office Saturday evening protesters chanting outside the court building Kevin on was confirmed fifty to forty eight after wrenching debate secretary of state Mike Pompeo has pledged that the Trump administration's effort to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons will be fully coordinated with Japan and South Korea ...
