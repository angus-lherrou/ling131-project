name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to\nMichael thank you for the ... and uh you're right about those words if I said anything like that a my BS meter would go off I wouldn't be able to protect you can save the world by politics but my wife would just lack me upside the head\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant near new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because it's a very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics and didn't get us into this mess and politics and then going to get us out what do you mean by that\nYet so I'm sure we're gonna talk today about politics and why does matter so I don't want to mislead an have your audience and saying that it doesn't it surely does\nBut what we're going through right now even in the chaos in our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are and economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways we're going to\nProduce more total goods and services than the world has ever known and all of human history a partly because of the digital revolution but one of the things that it does is it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have lots of social science literature now confirming what people have\nKnown for millennia a through philosophy and be allergy which has been rooted makes you happy do you have a family\nOr do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation do you have some projects with co workers in your community you have a local were spin community if you have those things you tend to be happy that's about rooted nest and yet our technology of letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this rootless age and so\nTraditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace et cetera\nThere and collapse and so we're trying to find meaning grand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can as emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with um Americans believing that you're either on our side or you're on the other side and the other side is pure evil and our site is pure good\nThat kind of political talked flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal uh relationships in support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking\nI did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a\nOf New York and Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys and anti thought and and the two groups of of Todd's who seem to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another and you follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [noise]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh if you're from antifa new beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... and he beat up somebody from antifa\nHow does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs were kind of lovable\nRight exactly and they can sing uh it it turns out that you know if\nYou if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that but the great quick hit a takedown is good to just sort of\nA pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agree with you but you don't persuade anybody that way and so when people use all these war metaphors for politics I think it's sort of miss understands what we think of the American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics maintained a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can drive and flourish but things that matter are the communities of love and your neighborhood where you persuade people to join with you in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving those local community as well\nBut a lot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural or tribes of affection and community and you know the your your point about um about the loneliness a lion you used there are half as many friends in America\nAre in the last twenty seven years what does that mean social science data showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three point two friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half as many forty percent of Americans have either zero or only one Koch to not into all there is a loneliness like out there\nAnd a whole bunch of people go to politics sang at least I can figure out how to have a um an enemy with somebody else and I don't make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator or a Republican conservative Republican from Nebraska his book a new book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal um let me try to make a case and you can bet it down if you choose a\nThat that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nOr where you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing\nIs the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice Kavanaugh and they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump that we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness then we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat's going to go on and on and on so the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile and very destructive folks\nYeah Philip be overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one tweak so the or the overwhelming agreement is I'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaigning with people or so I absolutely want the Republican I Want us to not just\nA expand extend our majority and the fact that I Want the Republicans to to win in the house\nUm but at the ... but I felt the same time the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred in the U.S Senate so if you look at anybody score card on on who the most conservative senator I'm always on the top half dozen of everybody's scorecard so I'm not in different uh on political matters and\nThis was not an argument hey let's just offering to buy off and have a much metal there's really nobody more conservative than I Am\nBut I think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might do something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if they retake the house\nStopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the healing that's gonna satisfy people is\nIn a world where job duration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more a smart humans with brains are figuring out ways to produce more goods and services are more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great but it means average duration that uh from I was born in Nineteen Seventy two\nAverage tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner today it's four point two years and getting shorter\nOne of the things that means is you don't have relationships with your coworkers that last over the course of a lifetime and nails in particular aren't actually good at forming new relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old\nAnd so we've got a lot more loneliness and their country politics can fix that problem rebuilding their neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book is about fifty percent constructive\nAbout what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood I Do I\nDo I joined with a local civic organizations that made them more likely to know the person who lives two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with be unhappy\nAnd uh that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post at our website at Michael midday dot com\nOr a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith and you do talk about uh the the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country\nWhat's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues a vet that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\nYeah ... well said so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time\nI'm In in the same way that deep friendship and pick a nuclear families and shared work are heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well\nThat we we know in the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family damn if your friends do you think your work is meaningful and do you have a philosophical theological framework to make sense of death or suffering that drives happy that but one of the other things that happens in your local worshipping community is you're with people in an intergenerational context overtime\nAnd it turns out that I I've got two teenage daughters and then the younger side as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nThey really think the accident of birth year defines almost all the people they should associate with\nHow how do we fix that I Want to get to that with Senator Ben Sasse his new book is them why we hate each other and how they feel there's so much in this book about where we can go not just in politics of course but in our personal and economic lives will be right back with Senator Ben Sasse\nI really do think there is a desperation for some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want what they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve a long term problems they're trying to make politics the center of the gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future a speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group bleed and had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when does to you today a talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there's only one house in the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nAnd they do a ... there's less fence of printing constantly for the cameras and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most conservative or senators and the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican legislature people do not officially ... really parties in our unit camera all our one one house a state legislature and so what people are mostly doing is wrestling with Walker term pragmatic question\nHow do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bill that's cost effective uh\nThere's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have slightly different priorities of which bridge in which I way to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell but objects if if federal politics do what they should in America constitutional hooked up with your maintain a framework for ordered liberty appropriate idea that people are created with dignity and the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights\nGovernment is the author stores are right then government give you a small number of big bang\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back and communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's part of the theme of nam why we hate each other and how to heal\nIs the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska all I can say is keep it up senator we need you there in Washington and across the country\nAnd the book is posted up at our website at Michael med med dot com we'll be right back with more on a divided country may be coming
