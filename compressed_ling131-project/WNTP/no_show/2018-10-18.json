{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WNTP", "content": "I get goofy you get goofy we have a lot of fun but honestly the vice president he really did enjoy the set of the number of times he said we've got to make this an annual thing\nA because he he actually enjoyed the the goofy and us you know I I was worried about ...\n[laughter] I think even speaking half the time why am I here you know what's good for your book Donald strange just walk by Eric ... is the illustrator\nHe not only is he the illustrator but I wrote it with him ... partners we've done a number of books together people look it up online some of the most beautiful illustrations you've ever seen or his books but when I\nReally was thinking about who do I vote he's the guy that convinced me to take Trump's seriously he said this guy is a folk hero he's an American folk hero and that's what gave me the idea to write the book\nDonald drained the swamp I said he's a larger than life figure I Need to write a kids' book or a or I mean this is the kids but but it's also humor book for adults in other words adults are going to find humor in this children's book\nThat kids aren't going to find I mean obviously there's a there's a little blue bird that tweets are there is a there's somebody you know the first swamp creature is the lobbyists or is I mean kids are not going to get that and ah and then there's another swamp creature that looks a heck of a lot\nLike a crying Chuck\nI don't know if you've heard of crying truck but he's a senator for yeah shortly up there and then there's George and then there's the the the biggest bad a swamp creature of them all the Georgia saw us\nAnd you know adults will get that\nBut kids I think I'm part of his book really is that I think we who have supported this president we need to have some fun we need to celebrate\nAnd we need to have something a narrative that's a positive narrative about what's going on we don't need to be in the weeds every day with all the details and everything we need to just say something good is happening in America and by the way\nMost people understand that we're being reconnected to our government were never supposed to have a big bloated\nBureaucracy we're supposed to be a free people who govern ourselves\nThat's what this big his book is all about and I really think it's important that we remind ourselves of that and we teach our kids what that is and so this is a fable about American style self government\nFeaturing a caveman name Donald and the swamp creatures and all that kind of stuff I mean I have to say it's sweet it's innocent it's not mean spirited so I Hope people will will will use it to teach their kids but also just for adults to happen I think a lot of adults are going to give this to other adults I Hope\nConservative adults will give it to a to they're never Trump or friends you know just as a joke or something because it is not mean spirited meant for us all to to laugh\nNow it's a total for me it's called Donald drink drain the swamp it's probably the only book or at least be only one I Know is certainly a for a pub positive you president\nAnd it's just in a very far away it's ... it's a Donald the caveman book right as it is a series of Donald ...\nYears going on but I think the next one is going to be Donnell builds the wall or whether Congress gives them funding or not\nA you know that kind of thing but I I think there will be other books he lives in Michael in Dallas my pillow we're creating pillows based on this book that's not a joke that's actually true we're creating a plus now it's going to go it's getting crazy dentist is getting pretty but people once you buy your make America great hat\nYou know ... that's about it right and so I thought we need to have something just a fun thing or you know so we can celebrate\nWhat is happening and it's not it's not a bitter thing it's it's ... it's a bipartisan swamp if you're a careful reader of the illustrations I Can't get too specific but it's a bipartisan swamp and you know it's it's meant to be happy and fun\nWhile it is absolutely aren't going to be regarded with Donald ... swamp why what caused you to even come up with this idea well\nHonestly I\nI was mentioning Tim rag when he's he's my friend of Thirty years and he's the one that that really made me see that I that I was missing something with Trump said this guy's a folk hero and Tim and I've written all these children's books together and after the election I thought you know what I Wonder holy cow I should write a book with him\nLike a kids' book for ... with Donald as a folk hero I didn't know what the idea was but it just kind of jumped into my head like ideas sometimes do\nAnd I knew immediately it was a good idea and I had to do it but I didn't know what it was going to be and I kept talking to him about it and he wasn't getting it and I saw this doesn't make sense he's the guy that that made me understand\nWhen you when you
