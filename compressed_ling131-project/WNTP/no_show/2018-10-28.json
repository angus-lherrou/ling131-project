Hi everybody\nYou're listening to the dentist Prager show very interesting experience five dealerships car dealerships nearly area [noise] and the experience was essentially the same in each they've made such an impact on my\nOn me and my wife or to speak correct English on my wife to me that I actually have written\nMy Tuesday column comes up tomorrow or on on the subject\nWas among the things that most go up to me was the lack of knowledge about cars that they're selling ... among these all all of them young mostly males a\nSales sales people at the if the car dealerships\nIt was it was remarkable\nI asked some truly basic I mean you'll be basic questions and the answer in each case was\nAnd everywhere and mainstream media President Trump's approval rating is the highest it's ever been okay don't get too excited it's forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed\nThe gap between disapproval an approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh and uh then on Thursday I'll be home God willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's races and Senate races and more [noise] but right now\nIs all so tight your vote really really\nMatters one of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when\nTo change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh\nAnd um [noise] in the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair and uh they showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd ask them why and he had no idea he couldn't answer it and the answer is\nVery obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nThey um and most Americans like the economic situation we're in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job a meanwhile\nWith an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there is a new book that suggests that it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening\nAnd uh [noise] there is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana\nWe did um [noise] a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a a a guy who said look I'm just a normal [noise] I'm middle aged a stay at home dad\nGo almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction and this individual by the way is for legalize marijuana is going to be joining\nUs on the show to tell his story and to answer your questions at a take your comments that all coming up on the Michael ... a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise] honestly part\nOf it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should simply open the gate and and lead in all the people from the caravan the\nEven those of us who support him immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants that I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that you get seven thousand people together and they're marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let them in because they're having a tough time in Honduras there are a lot of suffering people\nRight but the notion that that are\nAt that his somehow one of the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea that President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea\nYou don't simply a let people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nMeanwhile somebody who seems to have a position on everything\nBut I don't really think he has a position on the caravan because how could he be is a battle or Rourke\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he is he is now inspired people\nIs is the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy who once called lie in bed and people say oh to Trump such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together it happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George ... a age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty\nAttacked him pretty partially he said the Reagan was practicing voodoo economics\nAnd then later re embrace that Bhutto economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president and uh they honored and came to like each other or this is\nAll remarkable what is going on that the election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song\nOver the great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as ... the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies like this\nI read them God\nWay the guy is totally [noise]\n\nKnown men so\nOn to me doesn't burn by turning boots ...\nNow and then\nWe found [noise] ...\nMen oh mom you\nDon't feel that a little a little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs a in a campaign was President Trump\nYou remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one to get on the Trump train 'em in any event the better our work and the the ecstasy about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people about Beto O'Rourke\n... what it is that the jurors the soul and and makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator and he's a conscientious and substantive conservative\nAnd by the way you know so much more about the issues than Beto O'Rourke what is it the better our work is going to do for the country\nThat inspires reactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just the candidate he's a rock star listen I'm\nObvious strategies that are more than a in a modern Ken very literate show off everywhere\nFor everyone you can be without an interruption in from the benefactor much I Love your thinking well you\nThere's so many\n\nOkay um [noise] or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number of President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about are the Democrats offering mom's not jobs or we will get to that and uh we will get to\nWhat the election comes down to there is also a a a a very alarming peace in the New York times at least has meant to be alarming I didn't think about it so bad\nIt's by David Leonhardt and is what if the Republicans when everything the fact that\nThe New York times even thinking about that that shows you which side has momentum at the moment we will be right back on the Michael med show with your\nCalls [noise]\nMichael you rock\nMichael\n... Michael visual\n[laughter] used\nTo the country the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a ...\nPerforming and it is a performance that sort of a performance art as they say when he was doing a town hall in or\nNear El Paso which is where he's from\nAnd you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that\nNo he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he rules out pretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that\nUm [noise] and some and then it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race was he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he has said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the smaller investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish but needs to finish but that doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of people on the far right the ... just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the kinds hey I appreciate your call um I I'm a I Will get back\nTo this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of them at least to sort of\nFlummoxed some of his age uh there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that's soon and very soon a and he says it's people are going to love it it's going to be a big middle tax a\nFlat tax cuts middle class tax cuts and a\nAnd then there's this whole matter of a transgendered support by government [noise] is this a political ploy ... substantive we'll get to that and more with your calls coming up on them at that show\nMy below was now offering a special deal buy one get one free go do my below doggone usually promo goad Madrid [noise]\nListen live anywhere in the world and W.
