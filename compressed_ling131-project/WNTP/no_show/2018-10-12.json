steal property but first and foremost meant don't steal people don't kidnap\nHow many people know that but I'm telling you people knew it I don't know how people defend that slavery on the basis of the Bible the notion that you know one of a no was sons ham was\nUh was cursed because he was black and it's it's it's so stupid it's so attached to zero bases zero zero basis in the Bible\n\nWhich I

it clear this was the son and their understanding of science and scripture\nAnd what happens on the fourth day is the the the sun and the moon become visible remember the earth was covered by thick layer whether\nIt was gas or moisture clouds so nothing was visible\nBut it was created and\nAs the astrophysicist in a as a physicist and MIT and Israel said to me uh she's she has seen
