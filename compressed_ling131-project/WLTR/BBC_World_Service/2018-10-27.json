contemplative mind in society she's just written a new book together with ROM DOS walking each other ... conversations on loving and dying we spoke into that I'm Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life your early life\nWell my early life I was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left\nWell my early life I was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and it was right after the war I say the second\nWorld [laughter] and you have to be the war [laughter] and um\n[noise] there wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning\nFor my whole childhood and um\nJust with gold seen insurance ... and a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and\nI had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back meditation we still had the model of it being monastic and so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine [laughter] right [laughter] ah [laughter]\nSo but I was just as committed as everybody else\nTo finding a way to bring this into um our lives and the west so\nFirst I started a business with my then husband John Bush and I was ... and yeah yeah I thought when I was most interested in a looming nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate\nBut we integrated and ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice and ...\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we we're discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually\nIt's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words as you can appreciate [laughter]\nYeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood you know where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the species and [noise] and at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there were there engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person\nMore creative more able to ah bring their their whole settles into work and to be able to grow from their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\nRight say [noise] that is a shift that is still a still has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nIdeals and practicality is yeah\nThis story of search inside yourself first of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it's\nHow you\nThat you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering and meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take\n[noise] yeah [noise] uh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book um search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him\nSo he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide whether it was so men decided it was going to be bringing meditation and things that are posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help\nSo I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and what we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm\nAfter talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there I suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasize the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame\nOffered the same practices but emphasized the practices that\nThat more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course and they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself and then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction\nAnd we asked Danny go home and who also is in bug guy or with us back all those here I I\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we posted in the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand go lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question\nAnything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable\nYou have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes you know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken\nTo the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to question right higher\nBut this course actually\nEnough time practice and a teaching to help people do that [noise] I mean\nOffers enough time practice and a teaching to heal people do that\nI mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that is you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like yeah politically correct is um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really so intrigues me in um\nIn your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has [noise] you know has is faring noble lineage um you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on this for ... years\nBut you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is a very root of judgment character and will [noise]\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was ... but that is the intention right of yeah\nThat is the end and that's just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah in William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures who have gone on especially in narrow science to oh yeah this is Richard Davidson Daniel Goldman cliffs Aaron mark Epstein\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and then there was something in your work there's just\n... and also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and then something in your work ... through and seeing that this contemplative\nImpulse is a kind of human and tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm\nIn ... center Owen cs Lewis ... the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that far away from me and it's really critically him they didn't\nSo much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nBut it's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we are we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful in sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started right and um we interviewed\nEighty people we identified this isn't Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew a number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for\nIt just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in\nYeah that is completely gone now daydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain [noise] um I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students\nAlso we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and in a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day [laughter] but it's just it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know those sites like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like\nBreathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter]\nFor their phones and about lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their face [laughter] [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and refining what's sacrilegious right [laughter] right well\nBut okay so I knew denied oh beautiful work is Google\nGirl and ... what's so great wind just right [laughter] right\nWell okay so and you did I get off work has Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is ... and um but you also written about and it's very\nPractical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ... yeah yeah um we devised that at Google [laughter] loved that she\nPut it in her magazine and plus I'm I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um\nYou just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop take three D. press follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then\nYou read the email and you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or do you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever ... we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective\nAnd then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it\nThere was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and said how did it go and um\nThey all said that was radical you know ... and then one guy said I\nSaid how did it go and um they all said that this radical knows me using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone [laughter]\nRight [laughter] so yeah I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful I wanted to go\nFor a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really see I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but what mindfulness compassion practices and others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes in mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate acronym\nSome mixed communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to boats see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it and communicate it we did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and\nSee how that last night and is there anything about that I Want to ask you about that are so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah\nYou know it's ... lawyers worry that\nCan they be as zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment it's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them when it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read\nActually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and they loved it oh yeah\nI just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it was about two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting great like physically like what we experience as a present mothers to yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which is all you meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can do that if it would be yeah\nI'm Krista tip and dishes on being today with Buddhist teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social healing and diverse contemplative practices\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice it so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I have to say like for myself I have um\nI've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise] even a kind of one off contemplative experience can be\nInstantaneously gratifying right it can be on just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very big like biological levels and stress and all of that but it's very hard to\nScience about how good it is for us on these very late Isaac biological levels and stress and all of that but it's very hard\nTo create this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided I could do six minutes in the morning while my teeth tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it's it's a hard time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find a way that works for you yeah well at the center\nWe we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered\nYou know we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um someone doing should be chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMindfulness of the breads and walking meditation right and my vote listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the engine appreciate the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that", "year": "2018",
