me it's like the more traditional teachings that are important to me as I said before\nFor native people\nTalking about these things it's important to process of healing uh-huh\nAnd for me I think it's not just feeling I Would add to that a sense of justice\nUh-huh you know being heard\nThen on the other hand she said for non native people\nFor native people\nTalking about these things it's important to process of healing\nUh-huh and for me I think it's not just healing I Would add to that a sense of justice\nUh-huh you know being heard\nAnd then on the other hand she said for non native people cheering and listening to these narratives these histories yeah and engaging in a conversation that is not about guilt\nAnd it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she said I'm freedom from denial\nUh-huh it allows a liberation so I think that that's\nReally um maybe what was important to me in this work you know and I didn't want to jump back a hundred or a hundred and fifty two hundred years\nOr I didn't want to jump back to wounded knee or send creek I wanted to say this is what it's like here and now you know in my own lifetime\nThis is not history this is not old history it's present in my life in my child's life my daughter's life right\nI'm someone recently asked me a little bit embarrassing\nUm they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter [laughter] in them and it was like oh my gosh that's so true but you know I was a little embarrassed just because I didn't want to seem obsessed but um I think that that was in ...\nYou know in my own lifetime this is not history this is not old history it's present in my life in my child's life my daughter's life right [noise] um someone recently asked me a little bit embarrassing\nUm they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter [laughter]\nIn them and it was like oh my gosh that's so true but you know I was a little embarrassed just because they didn't want to seem obsessed but um I think that that was important to me as well um that\nIt's not it's not just not the past it's it's the president and the future I guess that is a world where creating\nI'm Krista tip it and this is on being today with the poet lately long filter [noise]\nI feel like we're talking about something very specific but we're speaking in a moment of time of\nIncredible fracture and there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to be apologized for [laughter] I'm a you\nKnow it's one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it ... it's not just the ... not only talking about history you're also bringing in intelligence from life about what an apology is\nAnd and how when apologies are done well I mean this is thinks that there are scientists are studying to write it just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone gave a real apology\nThey are going to have to be apologized for [laughter] I'm a you know it's a one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it and it's not just that you're not only talking about history you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is\nAnd and how one apologies are done well I'm an interesting sitting there are scientists are studying to write and I just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone give a real apology and haven't received and have it start changing things in their brain\nOh really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has since you're right well there's there's I contact and so you register at you register that they were so you wrote in the beginning of the actually the beginning of your response whereas\nWhen offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through\nUm I listen for cracks and uncles are in the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mine too I feel from a sensitive\n... [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it's really important deliberation Nick this isn't just something we need to learn to do together\nRight as a people in that part of your citizenship yeah there's the physical presence the energy that is important\nBut on a national scale I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things\nThat um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say\nKnow a family members sit down next to me and apologize [laughter] I'm at a national level\nI don't think this isn't just something we need to learn to do together right as a people in that part of your citizenship yeah there's the physical presence the energy that is important\nBut on a national scale I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things that\nUm are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say\nYou know a family member sit down next to me and apologize I'm at a national level\nThere's a lot more that goes with it right um when I was writing this response or I started researching\nA lot of other apologies around the world or a national apologies one of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada yeah I'm\nA first nations people the first nations right yeah I'm On the boarding school the residential schools\nFor what happened there and the taking of their children and so on\nAnd that apology was read out loud it was like a verbal speech it was a transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality\nThere is a very different quality to the language\nAnd the pacing of that apology um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder a an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really\nAnd it had a very different quality there is a very different quality to the language and pacing of that apology [noise] um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder a an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really changed\nBut she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin\nBy honoring your treaties huh and doing what you said you would do yeah\nBut I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or at a national level\nI mean what other things you pointed out is that um and this was President Obama signed this a ... but it was signed on a weekend it was not read aloud there was no ceremony\nAnd there were no tribal leaders invited to witness it I'm right and that ceremony is an important\nWay and\nTribal culture to make something meaningful to signify that something has meaning\nMhm\nI think it's important in tribal culture but I think we have ceremonies all the time the White House yeah [laughter] yeah right\nAnd it's not read aloud there was no ceremony\nAnd there were no tribal leaders invited to witness it I'm right and that ceremony is an important\nWay and\nTribal culture to make something meaningful to signify that something has meaning\nMhm\nI think it's important in tribal culture but I think we

seeing it in that way I mean even just for example\nOne of my friends posted something really funny on a\nFacebook this morning I think and she was a reminding people when they're um to what was I think red will oh this is the season for getting ... and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more\nThan you need and leave the plant allow the plant to stay alive for the

question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be him and\nI'm asked to know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving process life there are some things you said about riding high science intriguing\nOh\n\nThe question I'm always kind of pursuing annoy each individual life\nIs its own way and to this question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be him and\nUm I also know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving across life but there\nAre some things you said about writing I find so intriguing\nI feel like the way you've written about them is how writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now provide solid deep joy\nPerhaps this story from writing seated comfortably in my court because of a life lesson it provided writing has shown me what happens with patients\nAnd someplace else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love\n[laughter]\nI Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and other way into the question of what you've got your learning about what it means to be human through the life of usually\nI think the writing practice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit I had never thought why wouldn't it be a writer one day\nI went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study right [laughter]\nBut I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing was just study writing\nPractice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit I had never thought oh I Want to be a writer one day\nBut I went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study right [laughter] but I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing was just studying writing\nAnd um it was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years I wrote some really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patients that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward that comes from that\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took me\nI Want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write but it was important to me it's kind of it's an ethic piece it's like six pages long yeah\nYeah yeah would you just briefly say what what's happening in that piece\nIn thirty eight yeah\nJust briefly in thirty eight it's a\nWritten to and for the Dakotas thirty eight who were I'm thirty eight ... men who are hung under the orders of I'm President
