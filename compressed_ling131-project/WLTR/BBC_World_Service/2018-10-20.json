at this dynamic that in the\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and rape pollution and great ... resistance to regulating polluters and I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that\nWould say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a there's a background I think\nI'm partly I think people I came to know a Louisiana felt that the federal government was a bigger better\nVersion of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out of the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this passage in in the book that I uh and strangers in their own land that I I just just just as an example of debts and maybe this person you're talking about you know Harold ... the state now it seems to come down on the little guy he no he says his take this\nAnd maybe this person you're talking about you know Harold someone doing it and to the state seems to come down on the little guy he no he says his take this by you if your motor boat leaks little gas into the water the

are so rich and powerful sat and say basically have a bond [laughter] the legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral majority work to the state\nSo they say okay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developing let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gets them in it for it I think it was one point

and to feel like the state is your enemy\n[noise] yeah and there's ... you also describe [noise] this interesting dynamic that um that again is is ... it's not something that would be obvious anybody on a lot of this is true but um for example you um\nYou you have this chapter called there are members\nAnd there is something where you you a decision is amazing Sundance about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory fell in part to respect for clerks and federal offices internal environmentalists\nSo much complexity there\nSure heart does mine yes oh yeah yeah\nBecause the people I came to know are no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in what area where you said the crab pots where you know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet\nAnd yet they're they're ... [laughter] I mean people work in the plants and I talked to a woman who said\nYou know I asked do you talk to neighbors about ah environment she said you know our neighbors working the plants and uh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused\nYou know our neighbors working plants and uh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused\nYeah you know is is the people working the plants would take on the guilt right or is that I didn't get along with it and you know and it is it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here their rules here right you're right like California's very strict rules we enjoy a cleaner environment as a result it's at that level the guilt it's not a personal one right so that was very poignant and sweet of her\nTo be mindful that you know an operator might feel with two ...\n[noise] yeah [noise] and scan like poignant this whole thing gets it as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we made we made it does make things messy right but again I you know I just feel like you are for this is saying let's let's deal with reality\nNot wishful thinking\nAnd let's talk about reality and not wishful thinking by having a simple\nUp respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is is bullying conversation Lee anybody else you know you're coming together to see if there can be common ground on the environment\nAnd there can be I think\nPeople I came to know are very interested and very proving of renewables in fact there's something called the green tea move from that as Tea Party that's up all for renewables\nOf renewables in fact there's something called the green tea move that as Tea Party that's all for renewables\nBut we're not even finding common ground because we weren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our bubble still in fact I I think that problem but remains with us\nAnd especially on the left I think there's a kind of a rigid sort of it we're turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out\nLooking for potential Columbus [noise]\nAfter a short break more with our Lee ...\nWe're putting all kinds of great extras into my pod cast feet poetry music and a new feature living the questions get it all as soon as it is released twenty subscribed to on being an apple pie cast Google type cast Spotify of wherever you like to listen\nSupport for being with just the tip it comes from the ...

I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there was potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for a non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure [noise]\nUm that is so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow\n[noise] right [laughter] wherever I'm hanging fruit right yeah mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm\nYou I'm In I'm strangers in their own land you near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to\nLouisiana friends on the ... to ... you know if you imagine if I if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and in your letter to\nYour friends on a liberal left I was just it kind of humanizing and its provocative and a human way consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their ...\nIt kind of humanizing and its provocative and Hemenway consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\n[noise] that's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own\nExperience and what if you\nGrew up in a family um it's so many said oh we were poor but we didn't do it at a great childhood but we were poor you know I'm OK what if that had been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact\nOf your life you know and what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job\nNo [noise] I think that there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or two people with different political views I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left as\nA at the blue collar class that live there serious said look we're the daily workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone wire or re paving roads were who were you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year\nAnd a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\nOld cocoon I've long been here as I Am and a kind of you know it's not only uh\nOf all the little cocoon I've long been here as I Am and a kind of you know it's not only a a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um\nAnd that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out it says is\nOn the left there's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on instead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them\nOr we need our sturdy coalitions and I think labor unions when the labor movement was much larger and and uh [noise] there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight right look different colors and and classes got together natural way isn't as the theory on each other yeah public school system is um but we're down on those\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired of every one\nOf the one where a very yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different regions and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills\nHow to treat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn new skills and then go cross a to see if we can rebuild does that connective tissue yeah [noise]\nI'm I'm sure people are said to you and I I I get into this conversation myself that um\n[noise] there's critique that\nThere are all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country and then ran this late right and I ... yeah yes and especially now yet again and it's when white people\nThat that you know the critique that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people\nUm have you have you work with that in your mind\nIt's true and I think it's a it's an important insight\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair yeah\nWhich is kind of a compassionate way crack epidemic with no yeah yeah ... whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which blacks ah wasn't it was a criminal and I'm like yeah yeah that's right yeah even worse [noise]\nSo and then it's a it's a point is that should be broadly received mhm\nSo I Want to draw too close to suspend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that\nIt's been just such a big wonderful conversation
