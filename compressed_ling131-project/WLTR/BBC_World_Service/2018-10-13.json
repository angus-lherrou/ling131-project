of how we got to this place and um\nYou know sell you\nYou know you you mean you say you're a liberal like your credentials are from um\nThank you and I don't think [laughter]\nI've worked really hard yeah okay\nAll right you know that you tell a story that I found very you know and you know how you you grew up\nOne of the interesting things you did you've done as you actually well she said you said I said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know\nThat you actually called a bunch of them up I did there were so many interesting things about my trolls even the word we choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq some very deep you Steve humanizing language yes um\nI I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um\nNo one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n... and these trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or cruel or unkind um and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line [noise] um and they're going through real hardships\nIn their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but\n... in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\n[noise] um\nNo one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay what do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're ... well the only thing I'll just say this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right\nNow but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and reads forgotten\nIt's or it could hurt you that they could make you feel the way you were feeling\nAnd the thing that they had the opportunity a lot of them apologize no thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with\nA lack of accountability it also has to do it this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own has\n... and so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenge to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly so there's this dehumanization\nOf technology that allows us to fuel the demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing an ambulance by at yeah yeah yeah\nSo I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually on us what I really think I'm curious if you agree with us Eric is I I've come to think that\nAh that the left by and large uh is\nTo humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity\nIs nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing that at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ...\nAnd we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people\nMy liberal friday say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there are still bassist and they're so as long as ... I hate them because they're so hateful I hate it out\nAnd we blame the people for than expressing these use as though not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntention to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume\nI Try very hard to assume that you liked me\nIn spite of some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've read and and and er and it's written and said about gay people I still don't assume you\nMean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best in people and I seems to me that's the gift I have to give other is if I Want them to believe the best of me you you actually call that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's\nPeople and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give other is if I Want them to believe the best of me you you actually called that a daily spiritual practice that says you know uh I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them are related dynamics swell up this\nWhich is that the culture we have created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of us here at pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and if yes I'd like to talk to much natural about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and energy and beyond ... ask Erick Erickson what us you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\nKnow it was totally made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ... it was just I didn't know anybody but a\nCouple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since um but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by them and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right\nActually our route several weeks ago about people in the right\nUp because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right actually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way\nAnd the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like rubber record on those but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city blocks\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics from Washington is the be all end all everything everything's subtract because none of us are in Washington\nI'm don't look I think it's very ... two points it's it's dangerous to suggest that justice sort of return to prevent ... could be the solution right because we have to remember that before the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had\nSegregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\n... that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is that I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first\nThat were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes um that\nTo the points that were making here or if there was a sign that says that professes um that\nPeople can change and grow\nAnd in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the divisiveness of racial segregation and slavery\nAnd the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality\nWe are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that didn't make sense it invites change\nIn the country at an individual's and so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and creates space for people to change in ...\nWhen you see this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we we've got to we've got to improve we can improve the others are we going to reverse I and I get a lot these days\nWe'll that's unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other sides going and there's this is absolutely use those who lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... is one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\n[noise] um\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip as we we know from neuro science that when people a sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they pick aside and\nNo one's gonna pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological ah it's all\nTo do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological ah it's also racial economic um and you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have these stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprised I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we've got a quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims\nYou know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican food so\nBut are there are studies that\nYou know look kids to go to racially integrated elementary schools\nHow grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated\nActivities and after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we I'm\nAs we wind down which is if the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree\nRight and that in fact uh\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a a proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something\nWe're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called common life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally said I haven't learned to stop hating it and and\nAnd and Eric ... yeah you said some of them not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been and\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um\nWhat is the experience you have of what does shift what shifts what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nThe experience myself\nBeing unexpectedly kind\nIn the face of\nPeople being cruel\n\nAnd seeing the difference of mix in yourself in for Neal better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it\nBut it in that as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like my\nI had the privilege of ...\nI'm your friend warning you that you might and likely [laughter]\nI had the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who\nWere you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden\nThat in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at\nThe receiving end of more of the hate should have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to ask but in some advisors long enough to laugh at us and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step off yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people\nLike they are all extraordinary and beautiful and equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work and I I'm blown away by the difference it makes you know which\nAlways struck um ... ... if it ... riddle to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture\nUm ... if it just riddles to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture that what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall the surf but in the apple it's actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct relationships in communities online and we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes a Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will that tried then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other and it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more to to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we were with a wife\nWho has cancer\nAnd I know we're we're running out of good years\nUm and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line or and not there ah I'm more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I I don't think there's a coincidence that all related ... that we both began having these internal conversations\nUm with having kids um that level of local and I don't mean to keep our local here there's not an additional just community physical real break bread community and in my book I Am a firm believer that everyone should learn to cook\nHere there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer that everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home\nAnd bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian also rose area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to be shared with the\nPhrase\nJesus um\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them [noise]\nAnd this is on being today with Eric accent and Sally\nOkay we\nCould finish one minute early which would please something deep and my radio bonds but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes you're better at that\nI don't know if this is a slam\nBring up with the two of you and in this room that's very much on my mind is so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so fixated\nFrom ... really\nSo happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we are so fixated road from ... really because there's more to life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics\nAnd um some things that puzzles me a curious have with the two of you because you are in that world is that on so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC
