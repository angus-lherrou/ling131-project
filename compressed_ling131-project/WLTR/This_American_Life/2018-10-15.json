politics is boring\nThat happen right wing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing that was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it\nAnd I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions and to me this\nOne feels the worst I think because the original hearing itself a doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses which so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was a motion was upsetting\nAnd then since at hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us off for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelief or the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nEven in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people\nThere are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean like they had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first\nAct Arizona Senator Jeff flake or second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise] both those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable with hall [noise] WB the Chicago this American Life America stay with us [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] one\nJudge [noise] to Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over there was undecided than seem like a no and Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week there's Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British is do we change has been a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill issues with them in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to them about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator\nNear and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview\nJust late fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tuned in this case though I think he was miserable\nHe just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was stuff\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\n... was one of the two women and that confrontation has had her play good morning good morning when the elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n\n... and Maria Gallagher the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history an on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days\nLots of people loved this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see\nHere's how I Know that story about the elevator\nSo much of these last week has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks mind is not true first of all I saw him she just had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and ready to do this morning that they have also we talked about it wasn't deep and there was a it\nWas the thing is not the thing that convinced him\nProtesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before fleeing I'd gotten an elevator and the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero to shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nWhat do you live in one way and therefore we believe women when you think you can't replace what do you have to say please something you can say the winning right now in the survivors glad we're having this or is it is\nDid it affect you and if we always like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe week making fun of himself talked about this before\nLike lots of men does age doesn't connect you well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm not sure what to do [noise]\n[noise] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore I explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who the would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing you sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize it and then we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there's likely to be as much doubt a certainty\nGoing out of this room today and and just have the little humility on that front section\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing became back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be the staff said they'd never seen them like this\nAgonizing to say it really was more so than anything any decision\nMight be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nOr any decision on a vote 'em it's been it's just\nIt's a debate for staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw you know\nNext morning of course we finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the head and you've got to come back to\nTo do for some sort of been a ...\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise]\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court or I Am not and I don't know\nWho's thought the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car\nPeople are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied with the FBI report [noise] do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week

ah\nIt has the obligation or to recognize the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court and\nDo\nWhat you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nUh the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMyself was uh\nThe learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political
