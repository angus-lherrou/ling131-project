I had made friends in high school but didn't really have orchestra friends yet and we were taking in orchestra trip so that was a little nerve wracking\nWhen you're a freshman this qualifies as a demi crisis among bus ride to Seattle chairing a hotel room with someone you don't know\nBut there's this one girl Lindsay she had to have friends in common so they decided to pair up room together and ride the bus together to be orchestra problem\nSo um what we do to Seattle and we're like it's awkward you know because we're like new friends trying to get to know each other and um and on one of our free days they send us to the Space Needle and I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle I live\nThere is that like carnival area all around it uh-huh and we're playing the little games all around there and we won the super troopers do you know what those are no [laughter]\nI'm there like the little plastic soldiers that have a plastic parachute you're supposed to drop them from

and ran to the edge and through the ... over the edge because there's nothing to stop you real really yeah and we were just like in heels of laughter and it was we thought it was so hilarious and um it's sort of broke the ice and our friendship\nLouisiana become best friends all through high school cut the senior year four years later another orchestra trip this time to Reno nevada Hannon Lindsey or in their hotel room studying\nAnd so when zinger both sitting at the desk in this hotel room in Reno nevada and the poop a trooper comes flying out of the sky and land on the window sills\n[laughter] we're and we\nLike we couldn't we couldn't believe that we open the window and we grab the true Britain we ran into the whole to try to like find other people that are are just are like we saw what had been playing a trick on us but no one knew what we were talking about no one even remember the thing in Seattle and so I still to this day I don't know\nWhy that happened [noise]\n\nOnce in a while we get pictures like this at the radio show coincidence stories\nThey don't really fit and where are you\n[noise] every once in a while we get pictures like this at the radio show [noise] coincidence stories\nJust they don't really fit in to our usual every week we bring you a theme format we've been sending them aside wondering what to do with them\nI mean so much to people\nI don't know it felt like it was about or French [laughter] you know it when it you know I I'm not someone that believe in God really but it's a little bit like an act of God or something like the cosmic and larger [noise]\nFinally it hit us if we got enough of them we could put them on the radio as their own thing so we put out a call to listeners send us your coincidence stories and you did hundreds and hundreds of you did [noise]\nWe read at least Thirteen hundred coincidence stories interviewed dozens of people\nHere just a few things we've learned\nHere most prone to coincidences when you're young teens or twenties lots of coincidences involve your grandmother you're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands coincidence is also happened to you in or near airplanes or on Craig's list\nFor many of you coincidences where the answer to your prayers are how'd you find you're missing bike also there are coincidences hidden in your name your keys you're close your address we heard stories\nA lost roll of film discovered coincidentally in the stomach of a decomposing high enough about the man who got his favorite T shirt back from strangers naps ac in Slovakia\nAbout the woman who is dating not one but two mark Steven Anderson's at the same time but the student whose car broke down in rush hour on a busy highway and the one person who just happens to stop who comes to a rescue it's her dad lives for hours away and one of my favorites\nFrom a woman named Jill Peterson who felt nauseated on the subway in New York City\nWho lives for hours away and one of my favorites from a woman named Joe Peterson who felt nauseated on the subway in New York City\nAs they pull into the second avenue stop there was a garbage

going for the ...\nAnd uh you know it's it's all coming up and I'm growing up and as I'm throwing up in the can just forgot to commit perjury for throwing up and you can see that we're both like animals teeny asleep bursting into this can\nHave price staged and and we kinda look at each other like whoa\nI don't know what how how are you feeling I'm feeling a little bit better now like me to\nWhat's the only way to survive throwing up in front of a subway car full of strangers have a nice girl your age do it with you\nAnd numbers so many coincidences with numbers\nOne woman told us how she was at Thanksgiving with her extended family and I suddenly realized at six of them had the exact same number of letters in their names twenty three letters\nMichael are serve antibody Mary Elizabeth ... William Arthur fat the body\nCameras a guide them all doing surveys but just people their phone number it's obvious the guy who surveying starts to make up a number he says nine three three four five six\nWhen he read out that last number you said\nEight and I tried it that bad for a second but I was cool and I said no sir I'm Sorry that's not your phone number and he said well why is it that my phone number and they said because that's my phone number\nIs my point of the phone number is made up is actually my phone number\nThat's Mike on the phone number is made up is actually my phone number [noise]\nThese stories reminded me of an old Chinese saying I once heard\nActually I wanted a couple of weeks ago and I have no idea how old it is but it goes like\nThis ... ... that's my friend un U. N. D. food shelter ...\nAnd what isn't any if there's no coincidence there won't be stories\nNo coincidence no story to imply that\nOf course life's Earl\nDevelop in the ways that we can predict so is it like if you heard his story with a coincidence afterwards he might be like no coincidence no story like that right yes just the expression you use it to quote I say it like a corny thing to say\nMostly I think of no it won't be as do you ever use it\nWhen the important it yet [laughter]\nOr the risk of being corny I'm going to say at today's show no coincidence no story while the man's a way we're going to sneak these coincidence stories onto their all the stories you'll hear today first aired on our show twenty Thirteen\nAnd they're all verified true stories that my colleague hid from me until the actual interview so wouldn't spoil a surprise which is also why there is so much unprofessional giggling us our\nAnd full disclosure I came into this topic a coincidence skeptic believing that a coincidence is just a coincidence\nI judged I confronted weakness I countered wide eyed faith with statistical probability and by the end well\nI'm going to slow this down in ... just to let it sink in Helens mother had almost married Stevens father his late father actually he died when Steven was Seventeen and how this all came out was that after they had dinner they went back to students apartment and they were looking at Steven's family photograph\nSo you know my future mother in law's flipping through the album and she sees my dad and so she asked a you know oh what was his name and my mom tells the name and you know my my future mother of all kinds of not just moves on to keep the hoping to the book doesn't say anything\nTo imagine what she must have been feeling seeing that photo suddenly dislike flooded yeah she has a\nShe is must I think should be really good at poker [laughter]\n[noise]\nHey she hasn't she is must I think should be really good uh poker [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo how mothers says nothing goes home later that night she tells her daughter this was the one this was the man who might have been [noise] she explained that the reason they hadn't\nMarried was because her father highlands grandfather had chosen a different has been for the man who became Helen father all of them ended up living in the U. S.\nThey quickly lost touch Steven didn't find out about any of this until a couple of days later\nLast one hell and you know caused ups as a as if they tell you and she tells me and I was I was floored by it um and you know together will be called my mom and you know she put on a good face on it she but she was you know she was pretty shocked\nDid she know that there had been this other woman that your father had in love as the thing\nMy dad told her years and years ago you know there was this other woman that I that I that I Would love without ... you know long before I met you but mom was like look you look past I have a pass fail a past who cares um\nOf course you know never thinking that she was going to share grandchildren with that one that I mean she later admitted to me that if she had known this from the very beginning she would have not supported Helena me um you know it was just been like\nLook being with the daughter of this ... of the other woman your dad loved I mean it would ... can you find someone else [laughter]\n\nHow do you take this coincidence ... did it come to mean anything to you or to ...\nYeah there's something about it the fact that you know I didn't have the time with my dad that I wished I had had yeah\nAnd then suddenly to kind of ...\nYeah there's something about it the fact that\nYou know I didn't have the time with my dad that I wished I had had yeah and then suddenly to kind of have him be kind of an active part of my life again to\nThink that uh I can talk to my mother in law and hear what he was like in his twenties something that my mom doesn't even know\nAnd you know it might actually held his father is a strong believer in the idea that somehow my dad is somehow is behind all this and that somehow you know he's at I've helped make all this happened [noise]\n\n\nAt the time this next story takes place a guy named ... was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington heights he just started dating a woman named Esther they'd been out maybe eight times\nAnd I thought maybe it was time to\nGet exclusive or become boyfriend girlfriend or whatever it was and it was about to go out to lunch and I was

as trans bizarre\nStuck in my pocket you know charcoal and went to the store I got one of those voting frames and a little piece of gold when me and I stopped a dollar and the frame so it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold as if you know you're going to go in a church in Italy and they had a fragment from a robust some St or something like that and I call it the ...\nPiece of gold whereas if you know you're going to go on a church in Italy and they had a fragment from a robust some saying or something like that and I call it the immaculate dollar of Arlington heights\n\nAnd so I'm On the friday I asked her out and she was you know all excited and we're all guilty of that I I had one more thing for you and I gave her this frame with US dollar in it\nI start ... and he's like it's a dollar with your ... and he's he's on the side of south and I just look at 'em like freaked out\nShe a ton of fraud or brow a little bit and look concerned and ah I said you know is there a

stuck it up on the dresser and she came in the room I said hey I'm you never told me about this hour what's the deal with that she said well\nWhen everything teen you know I was a cashier working in a copy shop in downtown Chicago and I was dating someone and I just wasn't happy with him and I just thought you know how do people know who the right person that they're meant to be with how do how do they know who that is\nI said you know and I'm not going to worry about that I'm just going to put my name on the dollar bill and the guy that gets US dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him\nAnd I'm like well you can't just write them your name I Want actually I think it was more like maybe ten or twelve\nBill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him and I'm like well you can't just write them your name I Want actually I think it was more like maybe ten or twelve [noise]\nAnd so just dollar bill that you gave I Believe is the same dollar bill that I wrote my name on and I knew that we were going to be married to date you gave me this dollar bill\nIt was pretty crazy and then you read we found this story again he asked me like five or six times and as if

well forget it\nYou know I don't read too much into almost anything so I just got to move forward and then after she told me\nI think I went through all the the normal stages of whatever and I just but what does this mean for us are we going to invent a time machine or our kids going to bring world peace or like well what's the point of some sort of bigger\nThing that we're not seeing here [noise]\nNow it just sits in that very same frame up on our\nAddress or and I look at it every day that I wake up\nSometimes I reminder that we have it [noise]\nWhen she's upset at me or angry\nNever been a question in my mind like you know what I'm going to get this kind of the curve\nBut but I Do believe it's because of his dollar that I feel that type to them I mean obviously I Love him but I think that if it ever did cross my mind I'd be like the way\nI Believe it's because of his dollar that I feel that type to um I mean obviously I Love him but I think that if it ever did cross my mind

bill\nI guess you could also you know put it back out into the register and it'd be like luck I'm cash human than [laughter]\nI think it's got to go to somebody else you could do that [noise]\nPaul and Esther ... they've been married for Nineteen years\nAgo [noise] you know [noise]\nNo [noise]\nI was [noise]\nThree brother can you spare a dime\nThis story comes from Ryan rows are in Los Angeles\nHappened when I was in college um I was actually pledging a fraternity ... and I ran into some of the like the seniors and I'm On campus and they were laughing about something\nAnd so one of them tells me the story that had happened to him that day supposedly where she gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower he hears a team\nWhy is there a you know obviously like we like everyone was making jokes that you know he had changed falling out of his\nWe get to the top and we kind of look around and then we see that kind of on one side of it there's just this manhole cover like a circular man will cover like you'd see anywhere\nAnd coming from one of the edges of manhole cover it in place is\nUm long brown hair human hair long brown human hair\nThey're teenagers they're stoned their freaked out to have to tell an adult about what they've seen\nA police car happened to drive by the flag it's\nThey are teenagers they're stoned their freaked out\nTo have to tell an adult about what they've seen\nA police car happened to drive by their flag it down and the officer tells him to get in the back\nIt became clear that she was really concerned because she'd been said\nYeah there's been a girl missing\nOn the west side of town for the last couple of days so my God\nSo down like our hearts just sort of drop\nAnd you had known that hadn't been on the news or something like we had no idea that idea\nSo we we just kinda got scared at that point\nCan I can I used to have you ever taken is this are you going to get funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't have any I mean do you okay don't tell me\nI'm so she called another officer and the other officer comes there's a couple of cars\nAnd they both get out and they tell us to get out and they say okay wait at the bottom of it [noise]\nSo we're waiting there you go walking up\nAnd it's dark so we can't really\nSee them that well but we can see them well enough and we don't really want to watch what's going on because we see them\nAnd I'm trying not to look but of course I'm working\nPulled up the human figure out of the whole\nOh my God and then she says it's a mannequin\nI don't know what my friends with him but I was sitting there thinking own like\nHow does this story ended up okay you know I was in in any universe you know like [noise]\nUnless you say it's a male [laughter]\nJeff goes to school on Monday tells a story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says that was us we did\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations\nHis story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says that was us we did\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover a mannequin by the way had been the Virgin Mary and someone's nativity scene\nI think the real coincidence is that it's like our clothes from that [noise]\nCaused this to happen or they were good friends here [noise]\nRight no Jeff turns out that is not the real coincidence of the story by producer Brian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both missed the point\nIs just pointed out that I miss you and I are both working on my own story I submitted it to their residents of going\nTo the main coincidences there's a girl missing at the same time\nFive words for you drop food shelter ...\nNo coincidence no story [noise]\nHere's a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection\nIf that middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because one of ... line up just so you can't help it you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that\nIn that way coincidences are kind of like short cuts to a very big questions about fate about God even to people who don't believe in either one\nThe notion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life that there might be a plan conjured drew coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young the daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time when she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nWas listening to the song that old black magic and at the end of the song ... ...\nAt the time when she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nI was listening to the song that old black magic and at the end of the song Ella chosen a line that old black magic that Billy Daniels got me in and I've heard her you know thing that light on that album dozens of times before and wondered his buddy Daniels\nBut on this particular day for some reason I felt inspired to go out to the to the living room and ask my dad typically Daniels was and he explained that\nIn the forties the bill Daniels had some old like magic in a way that made it his song and he was referred to as Mr Black magic I guess back in the forties and it was a big deal at the time and\nI asked my dad had you met him you know did you ever know Billie Daniels and he said that they Daniels has probably dead now and just\nLiterally at that moment the phone rang\nSo I answered the phone and this and playful gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley\nAnd I said who's who's
