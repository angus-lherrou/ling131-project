the weekdays yes but also sometimes a not so classical music you know it's always kind of hard really to put your finger on exactly what classical music might be\nMozart obviously and hide and you

a pledge 'cause money needs to be raised to support the programming here on this station and I've had Bradley so many people say\nI saw a few comments this time around to that they appreciate the music in the middle of the day because it gives them a break from the news and information they normally consume and they have their times for doing that but then there's time for the music\nYeah I mean it really is encouraging to hear that offered so thanks for sharing the news and it's a real joy of mine to be able to share this music this huge range of music I mean we call it classical but\nReally you might be talking about a late renaissance Madrigal by one of the English composers you might be talking about a film score that was\nComposed a couple of years ago or something that split the difference say shoe on work like that and this music or just really does make such a nice soundtrack to your daily routine but on top of that if you really want to put on the headphones and listened very intently you can do that to\nA and and I know what this music does for me and\nAnd just so thrilled to be able to share it with the listeners of South Carolina public radio listeners

I will be one of those people\nSitting there going to wait a minute wait a minute I Know this guy he's twenty century it's it's it's it's\nAnd I have to listen to the end because I Want to fight that ... that's how it is with me I find it invariably if I get to the tune right then the composer is a question Martin I noticed dial the composer I feel has as clearly by then the the tune itself will lose me\nAnd rarely though I mean maybe not so rarely is I Would say but I Will just be completely wrong and say well this is a really Chopin or something and\nTo those who are numbered among the constellation of sustaining stars end to those who have picked up the phone this morning and given us a call so encouraging\nTo have your support so encouraging not only to get those donations but to see some comments on what this per granting means for you a missed McCarthy who listens from Columbia says that it's great classical programming\nOr that's the that's the reason why she changed into this station which she enjoys about it\nAnd a number of others have also\nChimed in with their support Mr Davidson listening from Charleston says that it's all about integrity compassion love\nInsanity so a great that we can provide this same space as well as this educational uh inspirational and entertaining space here on the airwaves in South Carolina Public radio\nEven a missile wit listening from Cornelius North Carolina across the border there and the Tar Heel state says thank you for broadcasting into North Carolina where I can pick up your station and don't get to listen often but I've heard some shows in seconds I don't hear with the NPR station here\nSo even even among public radio stations you know that South Carolina Public radio is indeed a unique space I mean

that number until it hits the road and then we can really keep\nSailing on with some regular programming keeps selling on ... on his Rhein journey\nTalking about of course a record Wagner character from\nA well from his ring cycle of operas particularly in this case will listen to something from go to ... or the immolation of the gods and this is one of many compositions by Wagner is that shows his use of the life motif\nEssentially a little musical idea little a piece of melody that calls to mind a certain character you might think of it almost as a a short theme song maybe not quite as worked as a theme song but this is musical idea that kind of stands for certain characters so for instance if\nIs it freed himself is not on stage but\nYou hear his little horn calls team playing than ah maybe\nMaybe just characters thinking about ... feet or maybe he somehow having some influence on the situation and so I thought you know Wagner it would be great a composer whose music we might put in this hour which so far it's been all about and movie scores a but certain\nAnd so I thought you know Wagner it would be a great judge a composer whose music we might put in this hour which so far it's been all about and movie scores\nAre but certainly even before the dawn of movies even before silent movies Wagner was laying down some some principals some approaches to composing that would have a huge influence on a music mogul uh scores for movies\nAnd in fact I've I've often heard it said from listeners they say is that the movie score I heard it sounded so cinematic and it's\nIt's a my answer that no that was just Wagner sometimes runoff gets the same thing but at the standard they sat down and the kind of sound rules they created specially this principle of light motifs\nHas been translated into movies threw out the decades so when you're talking about\nStar Wars in space operas like that or historical dramas\nYou'll often hear these teens that stand for certain characters so record Wagner or whatever um shortcomings you may have had as a person and however controversial his music may have been even from from just a purely I'm artistic standpoint\nThere is no denying that he certainly exerted a huge influence in the world music composition\nIn the world of movie scores even before movies were around he he set the things in motion that would influence them\nAnd uh you know we even had an added to use often for him Wagner Murray and you get that sometimes with Beethoven Beethoven in a sometimes with hiding in Chopin she'll ask things like that but Wagner\nIs is so much his own kind of aesthetic realm that he gets an adjective more often than many of these other composers so let's get to the music this is dawn and decrease journey the weeds Ryan

Charleston in eighty nine point three an HD one of the iron cream down when my\nAnd WNPR Columbia Ninety One point\nA Good Friday morning to you and thanks for tuning into some ... in fact a special edition of not as in soundscapes because we're coming to you today with our live pledge drive your own South Carolina public radio\nWe didn't meet the deadline would well we didn't meet the goal for last night's deadline of two hundred sixty thousand dollars but today we are quickly chipping away at it so big thank you to everyone who was brought us down to our current remainder Ninety thousand eight hundred dollars and also some encouragement to those who haven't given\nSouth eastern like some of our Georgia in North Carolina listeners such a variety there and then the music too I mean you have a\nEchoes with with the libretto and are as well as performance today classical music roots music ... such a variety of music and even within classical music stairs genre ... are so many different styles dare to really keep you on your toes keep your neurons firing I think\nYou go if we were talking earlier about how classical music moves one and I was I think I ... I didn't really get a chance to say this I was talking about how the music and Bernard her mom was so effective in the movie the day the earth stood still\n... you said something about people saying that her mom's work or Herman if you prefer as is often people say oh his music sales like Phil music and you said well actually film music sounds like an art her mother and there's a lot of truth to that\nOf course a lot of composers who did film music in the thirties forties fifties came from Europe many of them to escape the war there came here brought the classical training they had an influence brought it into films\nSo it's not an unfamiliar style of music to hear something romantic or early twentieth century mixed in with some film music and maybe that's how you got started I got started by buying a film ... soundtrack when I was in junior high for\nTwo thousand dead one a space odyssey and of course Stanley Kubrick used not just music that sounded like traditional classical music he use classical music now twentieth century as well as\nNineteenth century uh and some of it very harrowing and moving but when I listen to the soundtrack with out the film\nSome of it was so moving to me I was in junior high and I went to a friend of mine had said you know about classical music will you help me go to get it\nMoving to me I was in junior high and I went to a friend of mine had said you know about classical music will you help me go to get a drop in a ... year record bar and [laughter]\nAnd buy some classical music albums I really want to get into this\nAnd that's how I started my listening so however you get into it whether it was Warner Brothers cartoons or you actually maybe had the music playing and your whole if you grew up it continues to play here and you are a part of that process when you make a call one eight hundred to five six eight five\nFive yes you're not only securing a place on the radio off for yourself\nFor this music but you're also ensuring that other listeners get to enjoy it and benefit from it\nYou know Alfred I was thinking about my own exposure to classical music I think it didn't come from some Warner Brothers cartoons maybe could be in a bar beer as well with with Tom and Jerry so it was kind of is fun element for me and I remember seeing the famous and really critically acclaimed cartoon\nWhat's opera doc famous killed a rabbit mhm and uh I was just so caught up in that vein of course it's a huge forest and kind of a mocking Wagner and offer culture and all sorts of things but it was it was just really captivating\nTo me so from an early age I was I was in the classical music and I can remember actually my brother used to play some pranks on me Wendy's commercials would come along for say a set of you know classical music is greatest hits\nYou know he would turn of the volume TV was on the other room and I get run out 'cause I Want to hear the music and he changed the station is like the ... and and I said well I thought I heard this playing that maybe not and then of course you just see ... to come up on his face and a\nNo no the he was he was playing the prank but certainly has music um means a lot to me and it means a lot to you as well so again show what it means to you and give us a call at one eight hundred to five six eight five three five we really appreciate your support as this\nShow

really don't like crowds but this is a group\nA if not a crowd than it is in a gathering of people a community of people who support public radio and I guess if you put us all the one place we'd be a
