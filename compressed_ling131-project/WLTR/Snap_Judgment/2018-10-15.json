John ... pro rock climbers pro free use of the free the bravest brave to paint traveled the world\nAnd climbed the hardest in most exotic\nIn two thousand north bay sponsored the for them to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale the famous yellow that\nI got about three quarters aware cross and ah I ended up setting off the ball and funding into the main crying and I was right at the top of a water\nThe law and I got about three quarters aware across and ah I ended up setting off the phone I'm finding into the main crying and I was right at the top of a waterfall\nThought to myself like a nice for idiot because now you're going to have relatively drown in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely soaked but also get the get the log across the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAnd undo came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand employment when the rock and he was terrified of rocking on law\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted as even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me his rifle\nI was I thought that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and that pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the sub shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our characters\nEnough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause and we were totally on their side over the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was\nThey're causing that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goes and they praying they mind their own business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nThere was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained that John that we were all the way to go to this other place and then his boss was in and get on the phone and called Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned a job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself were pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and waited out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing\nJust doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just trying to wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into\nTheir own hands and the idea of killing somebody ... and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we'd seen them murders somebody I very much saw\nThem as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in\nSort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashed in their schools are stabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and um yeah I was in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky train one of the characters are ... split on now is only two characters with guns to for climate when\nThey want and locked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nI came up with this really good\nInvested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time [noise]\nUm where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken extra time it was when we took gases and it turns out than five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering on our chief worst super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nDo seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guns Base Camp and\nI'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain\nAlong with only one of his men as guard\nAnd that one guard was to an Eighteen year old\nKind of senators weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe\nAnd and obviously mess that he had bombed the story that I ...\nTop and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe\nAnd and obviously mess that he had bombed the story that I spent a week selling to us just bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and back then to not only\nThat I served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing Amman begging him to knock out the he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew lets see up the mountain\nNow it was four to one\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there's just as\nBall excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy got two guns and the anger named a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids as I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night\nAnd so John and I immediately\nUm\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find a I'm\nTrying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push 'em right now this is er\nSo it puts them in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it\nAnd she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing to\nClass and it just so scrambled\nUp over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm\nBut as I was reaching out to grab his guns drop the sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping a\nPoll as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards or\nThe bone fears losing them to support me off in a second operation mend means stiff\nCarrying the SCUD missiles [noise] um [noise] not stiffness manifest in my personality I'm I always\nKnew that he had medical issues and then obviously has to brand surgeries um those really traumatic for me I because [noise] fourteen at the time is to you in some like that this is ...\nBrother Spencer and well stewardess stiff or brittle Spencer is known by everyone and his family to be all heart and free spirit he loves being outdoors listen to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI liked it I can unjust zone out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like look ahead cranks revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you kinda\nYou know you had that sense of joy or to like find down it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy do until one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to\nVery terrible headaches and he was diagnosed with a male formation in his brain [noise]\nYou know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain Mel promotions\nBecause he was crazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another\nThat would have two children with brain mouth promotions because here's what's crazy Spencer in Studio\n... formation had nothing to do with one another but Spencers brain situation didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought\nThe surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when Spencer became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to Ken how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's like I say about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of I'm just\nNot read coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nA different person Spencer was scared his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes people experience lots of little changes like different food preferences\nLiking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous\nLike there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take her picture\nFor the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family\nAnd it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nHe's worried that if you change to the brain you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer\nWhatever it was that made him Spencer\nHe's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how\nI turned out and everything was them on better from their made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure\nEven if they help you know\nThere was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing some of my regrets about my own surgeries because I still [noise] um [noise] have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every\nTime\nMade it to him not one of my biggest regrets surgeries and and my surgeries and\nIt's made me a ... somewhat\nBetter person at times [noise]\nUm\n[noise] so can I get a little but Fishell it's optical with you there's like\n... [laughter] okay um so in like\nJulie ... story with Amy I'm been forced to\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nAnd I'm Wondering if that's the term is by our brain\nOr something less physical and I wonder what your thoughts are\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there\n[laughter] and then one day\nOf all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly set a goal to there and we spend too much having severe headache again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent you was just talking butter which at brash and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bad holding hands and feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read and there for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his ... I\nI thought we would lose them\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to spend ... hospital room in the ice you [noise] to see them [noise] in a coma in\nA condition that I hoped only I Would have to have dealt with and I wish I could have been union [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWant to take a short break\nAnd when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision that you know family she ever have to make\nOne step judgment the override episode continues stay too [noise]\n\nStay tuned [noise] [noise]\nSnap judgment is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide\nFuture at heart available on apple pie and cats they're ... cats are found\nFrom WNYC Studios will come back to step judgment override episode and it was the Washington\nAnd we left off young man Spencer you lay unconscious and hospital because of the melt formation in his brain and all that his family knew was that no matter what she never ever wanted to have brain surgery that's\nTo and how to strip and while he lay in the hospital bed today did\nEver wanted to have brain surgery\nCenter and had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated he's family his mom and dad Steven ... had to decide what to do a specifically they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons name was Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now they were the one to five percent chance it's been two would have another strip\nAnd that chance would increase every year of his life\nBut the surgery he was proposing with very risky with Dr Kim would explaining these very daunting odds any recording it does she could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nWho is is that some risk associated with it about five to ten\nMajor complications from surgery or mine or ... or anything in between\nThe surgery before that that\nMakes it says the situation is dramatic changes and knowing that we know now with all that you know what we want to do and I think that's the position of putting your guys then is to make that\nThe world knows better than freebie\nUm so it's not what you want or what I Want to rent or with mom or dad happy [noise]\nPerformed another surgery with a cup of coffee or cut I heard of a brand new nursery yes okay it may not be covered by the ... gun multiple though I Know that there's risk for is not a theoretical\nRisks are real risk if it happens all the all those particular surgeries which are drawn to that area what was the outcome will get a ... percent of a five to ten percent of them have a bad outcome", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "15"}
