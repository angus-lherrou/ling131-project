it was everything that you would imagine you know the the stately boardroom when hundreds of people watching you and um I think it\nIt went surprisingly well like I made my point and there were some changes made to the exemption process that accommodated\nMy concerns as well as the concerns of the three other companies that also testified alongside me my main push was for the exemption requests to be retroactive to the first date they're submitted not the first day that uh the Commerce Department decides to look at the request and entered into their system\nAnd that still didn't give me the
