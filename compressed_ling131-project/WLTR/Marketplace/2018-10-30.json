is changing sex scenes that forever and I should tell you we're going to keep it mostly clean but it is probably going to have to get a little bit racy bring a working with a program\nHi Kay so this is going to sound like a word where to start this interview but I'm the ... the entire premise of this article and and the job of a intimacy coordinators is that for actors this shit is\nA workplace it's the office yeah and I mean I think that you know it hasn't been treated like that in the past I don't think that it was necessarily\nOut of nine ten or on purpose but people get really uncomfortable effects especially in a workplace but it's something that really needs to be spoken about explicit we win sex and sexuality is involved in the actual job of making a film or making a TV show\nShow within the bounds of what the Federal Communications commission will let us talk about on the radio just for me as as it were the first ... the leader of this article that you wrote is it's really eliminating you know\n[laughter] yeah I started my article sort of trying to\nGet readers to enter into a TV set and what it's like for an actor and what that can be on the day when they're filming a sex scene\nAnd the case of and we need who plays Laurie on Deuce she is naked are half naked and she's ... and she's got all these eyes on her and this is a situation where I think a lot of

with\nHow did it come to pass that there was an intimacy coordinator unsaid to begin with yeah so after seats\nTo explicitly say this is what I'm comfortable with a\nCounter to come to pass that there

the script and she will go to the actor and she'll tell them what's in the script and then she will work it out with them defining what they feel comfortable with talking to them about their boundaries about anything that they would like on set to help them feel safe so then go back to the drive through on the producers and\nSee if she can work something out that everyone feels good about then when it comes to the day of filming\nShe is often standing within I shot of Dr um she is usually looking at the monitor to see how the scene is playing a so she's there to comment on the\nChoreography and she will help them protect themselves she'll tell them how to make things look more real without them having to do something that feels more sexual to them so it's about choreography the same way that we have fight scene choreography\nWrote a HBO did kind of makes sense is is leading the way on this or at least among the first because they've got this reputation for
