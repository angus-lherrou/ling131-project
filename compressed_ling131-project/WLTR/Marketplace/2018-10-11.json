I still utilize it yeah and I go to my mom's house and I get it and usually I drive around\nWhen I go to Philly I'll drive from like midnight till three in the morning literally just chasing ghosts and the thing I always do is when I go past\nThe place where the roots used to a mosque on um fits in South street there I'm always like yell like back in Nineteen Ninety two I thought Nineteen Ninety

know and she's doing really well and I said how are you made now and she said oh honey you're never made\nUm yeah even you know this is our our technically are twenty some professional year as a group\nAnd I I still work as if this could all end tomorrow that's why people ask like well you do so many things you have a Nineteen jobs like when did you get to relax and you just don't in my mind it's it's always this could end tomorrow so don't ever sleep\nYou know does it ever surprise you that you have become that guy now to people turn to for advice and mentorship and\nI'm I'm very uncomfortable with that even my Twitter handles says like I'm I'm Better as a student not a teacher like this whole course love is ... ... right you're bunch of rappers called me like oh gee\n[laughter] no I I kind of shrug it that what would you be here without the Tonight Show I mean you you have said that you looked at that and I drew a gig as a as a way to sort of fade into the sunset\nI'm I'm resilient so I Would like to think that I'd always be into something but I Would be a fool if I didn't tell you that the Tonight Show opened up even way more ...\nNot a teacher like this whole course love is said scholar at ... right you're bunch of rappers called me like oh gee\n[laughter] no I I kind of shrug it that ... would you be here without the Tonight Show I mean you you have said that you looked at that and I drew a gig as a as a way to sort of fade into the sunset\nI'm I'm resilient so I Would like to think that I'd always be into something but I Would be a fool if I didn't tell you that the Tonight Show opened up even way more doors than I expected like I I truly thought this was going to be the most gentle mercy killing ever [laughter]\nNo I I did I [laughter] I'm just glad I'm not ... not ones that I think like oh this could benefit you you know because I I was reading on the op eds and even though I Love being underestimated huh someone someone had a road in a I'm In a blog once like\nLike oh this is a sad day for music because watching the roots\nExcept this uh Tonight Show gig will be like watching Miles Davis bus getting a New York's ... man and I was actually like good so actually what I Want I Want to be underestimated 'cause I Want it to I Want it to to kill all a\nPerceptions of this being a square gig or do do you buy the sort of the the conventional wisdom you've changed laid out music [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media had just started to become a thing something like ... the idea of viral videos\nWas becoming a thing and we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block\nPerceptions of this being a square gig or do do you buy the sort of the the conventional wisdom that you've changed late night music [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media had just started to become a thing or something like ... the idea of viral videos\nWas becoming a thing and we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block and it was clear like Letterman wasn't going to start being on Snapchat and\nThat sort of thing so we just took advantage of and then the playing field you know a lot of late night shows were just post jazz music\nThere there were other avenues to explore and we took full advantage of it it it's interesting because there is a lineage right there's doc severance and from the old Tonight Show and then there's Paul Shaffer probably the next notable down in an interview\nAnd the roots that's weird and you know again like I didn't you know I didn't have posters of ... and said I Want to like one day that'll be me it's just making the most of it again like in two thousand eight when he proposed that to us so\nWe should say you you didn't take the call for a long time yeah I was like a man we just got to to a place where we were making good money on the road like why will return\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably or was that our domestic personal lives huh kids were getting older crime or at the airport\nSo it was sort of like we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there's a way that we could Celine Dion our way\nInto a position that I use all the stuff is herbs right or Celine Dion our way and\nPlace where we were making good money on the road like why would return\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably or was that our domestic personal lives kids were getting older crime or at the airport\nSo it was sort of like we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there's a way that we could Celine Dion our way\nInto a position now [laughter] I like to use all the stuff is herbs right or Celine Dion our way into\nA position where we could still make a good living without having to\nHave a ... for him and be on the bus for nine hours and that sort and then just fell into our lap and it was like be careful what you asked for\nThere's a ... this is going to get old marketplace in and you know ... management on your hair but I live for that stuff well well good and in fact that's the really the question right because you have said more than a couple of points\nPlanning something is the joy of actually doing that something and the question of the out of the question that comes out of it is what's it like to work for you how do you run the ban how you run the how you run you guys on the show\nUm you know there's there's lessons to be learned about it because again where we're at a phase in our lives where we're not twenty two twenty three like that here was forty five now yeah a ... a sign of it\nUm so the things that I Would like to do like you know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a room at sort of thing and we used to do\nYou know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that sort of thing not to mention a lot of our science projects\nWell it's weird because one the roots is just one\nWhere where to phase in our lives where we're not twenty two twenty three by day here what forty five now yeah I Wish I was okay for at least for that but it's a sign of\nUm so the things that I Would like to do like you know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a room at sort of thing and we used to do\nYou know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that's sort of thing not to mention a lot of our side projects\nWell it's weird because one the roots is just one of the Nineteen things I'm responsible for it and we're in a very sweet spot right now where we're actually having more fun with each other socially great that we've ever had I realize that we're going to fall apart if\nAs people we weren't\nHaving fun with each other you know what I mean so I think now just were in as as a unit [noise] this is the best it's ever been\nWorking at it right there thanks for coming to thank you very much appreciate
