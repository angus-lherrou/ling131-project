two black side characters who as as brown said had maybe twenty lines between them toms\nAnd brown is black and she asked other bottom Netflix users if they were experiencing the same phenomenon and she also along with it posted some other artwork that she'd seen for movies like love actually where she was shown black side characters who had a very small roles in the film\nShow there's there's a
