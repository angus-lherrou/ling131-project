athletic ran proven that is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic collide\nThat was a shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great walk Clyde Frasier and\nTo hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going to get good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a ... and it was very short lived they sign just one clear and been quarter and yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years ago when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had\nThese elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so of course with a big part of the appeal\nWith typing in with the players are today that are young and trend setting and exciting and it also is a complex thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball is really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much pull do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I did a lot of

a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona
