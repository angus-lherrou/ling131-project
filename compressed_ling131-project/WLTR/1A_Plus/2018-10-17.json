term ends a crucial race for governor is heating up Democrat Andrew Gillum is facing off against GOP candidate Ron dissent is and voters are closely watching how each candidate is handling the hurricane response efforts\nThirty ends will also decide on whether or not to restore voting rights to one point five million felons Florida is one of three states along with Iowa in Kentucky that permanently take the vote away from convicted felons\nAnd there are questions about whether people who haven't voted during the last three elections but emerged during the primaries will turn out again\nDavid Smiley has been covering all of this is the Miami Herald political reporter David welcome back to the takeaway thanks for having me\nSo there's a lot going on in Florida as we know um midterms are just a couple of weeks away how it was a storm like Michael affecting or could it affect people's engagement not just getting to the polls but their desire to vote\nWhere Michael hit a interestingly is a heavily Republican area and it really wiped out I'm One of the roads the uh infrastructure so immediately we're seeing questions about will but those counties in the Florida Panhandle be\nThe uh infrastructure so immediately we're seeing questions about will\nThose counties in the Florida Panhandle\nBe ready to vote for early voting on Monday and for election days so that'll be interesting to watch or they aren't the most populous counties\nBut that seems like it might affect Republican turnout um and just generally the hurricane has kind of reset the table for the campaigns\nYou know there were topics that were heavily in the media before the hurricane are formed in the Caribbean and began aiming for Tallahassee and\nThose issues like the economy and red tide were pretty quickly drowned out by hurricane Michael and um the devastation that caused and the ongoing recovery so I think it may change some statewide focus\nFrom voters on what they're thinking about and how they're viewing the candidates as governor Rick Scott runs against Bill Nelson N. is heavily involved in recovery efforts in as Andrew Gillum\nI had to take a break from the campaign or as mayor Tallahassee to handle the storm\nA Ron dissent is no longer a congressman trying to shift his campaign to remain involved without an official role hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\nDo we know that that's affected Gillum lead at all that he's had to sort of taste step aside to handle the hurricane or is this a campaign still going\nThe polls the recent polls have showed Gillum with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by saint Pete polls are came out this morning the really the first poll are taken to ... to potentially show hurricane effect and it still had\nGillum ... plus one um I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was uh so\nOne um I I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was a so heavily on the the media rotation during and after the store and more dissent as didn't have a invested role in the recovery and the preparations\nAre so I think I think we need to wait and see some of the polls that should be coming out in the next couple of days or weeks\nOr to see whether we'll see any other shift but in a state like Florida where a top of the ticket races are typically decided by one point uh I don't think we're going to see either Andrew Gillum or Ron dissent is a a head or behind by too much\nWe talked a little bit at the opening about the possibility of getting Floridians to restore the right to vote for one point five million former felons in the state has there been any movement can you gauge what the interest is so far I'm On that ballot measure\nWhat late last month we saw a University of north for to pull that had a ballot measure at Seventy one percent support\nTo get on the ballot or the the backers of 'em and then for a pursued a petition drive that received nearly nine hundred thousand signatures which obviously bodes well for support you would figure most of those\nSeem to tourists would also both for\nThe initiative um but in Florida you need you do need sixty percent to pass a valid question and I I Do think one there is a campaign against it and to ... we're gonna see some skepticism\nFrom people who either may not totally understand what the image seeks to do and the fact that I'm convicted felons do have to complete their probation and parole\nIn order to have their rights restored and then there'll be questions from voters about to what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for um people who are convicted\nAnd then there'll be questions from voters about to what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for um people who are convicted certain non violent offenses uh and and I don't think that's a slam dunk\nWe talked a little bit also about the fact that a Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the current governor Rick Scott won't be able to appoint three state Supreme Court justices who are the justices who are stepping down and I'm Wondering how that will effect on the liberal majority\nWell right on the seven member court there are three of of four justices who have kind of formed somewhat of a liberal voting bloc and have at times ruled against Rick Scott they are due to age limits are stepping down um the day that the next governor is sworn in and\nGiven that that decision will now fall to either Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas and they have such divergent opinions on what the court should look like\nThat seems likely to to energize a they're voting base is I think Republicans tend to be more attuned to\nIssues of the higher courts and the significance of it and we did see some a speculation that perhaps the cabinet hearings for the U.S Supreme Court might have actually a given Ron dissent is a bum who is trailing\nPretty consistently in the polls by a decent margin or and then seem to get a bump around the time of the cabinet hearing so it's possible that that controversy energized for the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant to side with his aunt is over Trump\nOr or or any other issues and um and that might have given him a bomb so probably better for the census them for ... certainly Planned Parenthood or abortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters\nScientists then for a gallon but certainly Planned Parenthood abortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I I don't think that you know a number of voters are just going to throw up their shoulders and think about it there's\nNever a
