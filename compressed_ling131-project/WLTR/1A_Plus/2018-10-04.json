that people would provide healthcare for everybody in the United states way too much too little not too much\nThe majority of Americans believe they're paying their fair share according to a Gallup

the court John from support for do county was on the ambiguous word\nLoyalty knees in Trump's mid west they all appear to me retaliating against industries affecting by Trump country working class white\nBut with all the focus on white rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump another important group of constituents is usually ignored\nThere are black people living outside of cities living mostly in the house and living in red states right so the black belt overlaps with Trump country and those are the folks that are really going to factor into elections across the south in these midterm elections\nThat Aaron Haynes whack and she's the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity and recently she's been reporting from rural counties in Georgia and part of what's called the black belt\nThe black belt is that what we know is the deep south which you know historically is where slavery thrived uh where you know the wealth of the plantation system was created\nAnd obviously when slavery went away these became some of the most impoverished areas in the country\nBut the black belt is also where frankly the battle for voting rights for African Americans was was waged\nAnd so you know you think about Fannie Lou Hamer Ella Jo Baker Fred Shuttlesworth John Lewis these people weren't from Baltimore Cleveland or New York you know they were from the deep south and they expanded that franchise for all and you know this is also the place where\nIssues like voter suppression continuing persist today and so that's one of the reasons why it's really important to focus on these folks and how they're going to factor into November and you mentioned voter suppression um tell us a little bit about some of the ...\nIt's really important to focus on these folks and how they're going to factor into November and you mentioned voter suppression um tell us a little bit about some of the other issues that are really top of mind for black working class rural Americans\nBecause a lot of these areas are poor they struggle with economic development opportunities a lot more than than urban areas but they also have healthcare challenges specifically\nAs we know minorities often have health care disparities from diabetes to sickle cell obesity but they don't necessarily have the access to health care that you would have\nSay in a city you can have dozens and dozens of churches for example but no hospitals for miles and miles and that's a real challenge for them and something\nSomething that has has not been addressed frankly by by the folks that that get elected in those parts of the country a lot of times\nAnd in your piece you went to Georgia to report this out why did you choose that state\nWhat's yours was really really important because\nIn Georgia there is obviously a very a high profile gubernatorial contest where possibly be first African American woman could be elected governor in the country and that Stacey Abrams and Stacey Abrams actually started her campaign\nIn South Georgia where a lot of these black rural voters Liz\nAnd the reason that that's important is because you know about a third of the rural folks in Georgia are people of color and so unlike other contest local contest for example that may be\nDilute the power of people of color frankly because of of racial gerrymandering you know in a statewide contest these are the voters that could really be key to to those kinds of victory and frankly you know what she has done go into a lot of these places that had been\nThat could really be key to to those kinds of victories and frankly you know what she has done go into a lot of these places that had been forgotten\nBy Democrats in recent cycles could make the difference uh in the in that contest and others in in the south where you have a large populations of black folks especially in rural counties\nAaron one thing that comes across in your piece is that the black rural populations that you spoke to felt disaffected by politics that seems to be shifting and I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about that well one thing that's\nImportant to think about for these folks is because they felt like they they they were electing people who weren't forgetting about them kind of in between election times you know they they were they were\nVoting for people who then did not come back and give them like I said the economic development that they were looking for or the health care that they need and so they felt like\nAt least in these off presidential year elections that their vote didn't count you know you've got now folks who look like them running in more of these places are in in in several these counties that I went to you have incumbents who you know been in office for years in some cases even white conservative lawmakers at the local level\nRepresenting majority black counties and and I wondered you know how is that possible well these people have gone unchallenged\nFor so long or people you know have not paid attention to those local level elections and so these people have stayed in office but but now that starting to change his folks are starting to get more engaged in these local uh down ballot races and realizing that that they can also make a difference\nAnd and what's interesting also is that I interviewed therapists marsh is a journalist and a couple of weeks ago and she was talking about how white progressive rural voters feel that their perspectives have been forgotten in the Trump country narrative\nYou know I brought this up to them you know doing my reporting it now a lot of the nodded their heads in agreement I you know they're not front of mind when you think about rural voters or even farmers I mean black people there's never been a time in this country when black people have not been connected to the land\nAnd so the idea that somehow we have been distance from that narrative is is really interesting to me I mean I'm from the south and so obviously for me that's not something that's foreign but but for a lot of folks that that are in cities and maybe you know either don't have relatives are aren't getting back\nTo to that part of the country to see family or friends it doesn't always occur to folks that yes there are black people living in rural areas in quite a lot of them frankly\nI'm curious if you think there could be the potential for coalitions to be formed between the more progressive white rural voters and rural black voters who might be able to see some opportunities there for cross pollination if you will of ideas or is that just to is it too early to tell right now\nWell you know I think it's entirely possible and I say that because again when you're in a small place like that you know these are folks that are interacting\nSo much I mean not to suggest that there are still places like that where there there is segregation of people are living in different parts of town but the town is so much smaller than say a big city and so these are folks that really do\nKnow each other you know I I think of a recent campaign stop the stay the Ames head down and plains Georgia which is the hometown of former President Jimmy Carter\nAnd you know the idea that the two of them would be on the campaign trail together President Carter has endorsed her they're talking about rural healthcare that's something that affects both those progressive white rural voters and black rural voters and so you know understanding\nThey're talking about rural health care that's something that affects both those progressive white rural voters and black rural voters and so you know understanding that they do have shared interests I I think does present an opportunity for just that kind of coalition that you talk about\n... the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity Aaron thanks for joining us\n[noise]\nYou're listening to South Carolina public radio this program is made possible through

pressures threes and be deadly last line of defense for the Amazon on the world [noise]\nThis afternoon ...\n\nThis is the takeaway I'm tansy innovate got\nWhen a woman is a victim of domestic violence finding a way out is not easy for immigrant women especially those who are undocumented things can be even more complicated in fact immigrant women are nearly twice as likely as the general population to experience domestic violence\nThese women may not be aware of the legal options available to them or those options themselves may be limited many of them say they fear of deportation if they contact\nOver the last several decades a secretive network of like the nuts has sprung up in California to help those suffering from domestic abuse women who actually opened their homes at shelters for abused and then\nThe pressure is a contributing writer for California Sunday magazine and she reported on this underground network of women giving abused immigrants safety companionship and even medical and legal advice\nPresser says there are about one hundred and fifty other Latino women nationwide doing work\nThe opinion chip and even medical and legal advice\n... says there are about one hundred and fifty other let the women nationwide doing work similar to what she saw in California\nAnd she told me about one of the woman she followed in her reporting so I feel a woman and Valentino and she's opening her home in one of the women who who's she's working with as a woman who I call Sylvia um she has been in an abusive relationship for many years and for a while\nShe was struggling to leave because she was nervous about\nJust going public with her story at all since Trump was elected she became much more nervous about the threat of deportation and in particular about losing her children and so\nShe came to Valentino is house and stay for a week and now Valentino sees her regularly to check in on her and she understands that this is a long process right to the average an average woman tries seven times to leave her\nAbusive partner in this country when you're an immigrant women that can be even more difficult what is a you visa and how does it play into this conversation where\nI'll step back a little so the violence against women act was first passed in Nineteen Ninety four and it was the first federal legislative package that was designed to end violence against women and it included a piece of legislation that provided a path to permanent residency for\nAbuse immigrant women whose spouses where their abusers and who are also us at a center permanent residents the really small fraction of African women\nIn two thousand with reauthorization of the violence against women act that was expanded in the movies that was created and offered a path to permanent residency for immigrant women who were victims of violent crime and who were willing to\nHelp with the investigation and prosecution of that crime it was bipartisan legislation so that ... is that where does it stand today in the past four years we've seen an enormous backlog grow in twenty four team the government was granting visas to women\n... is that where does it stand today\nIn the past four years have seen an enormous backlog grow in twenty four team the government was granting visas to him and who had applied five months earlier if you apply today evil eight nine years for a visa there isn't a hundred and twenty thousand person that clock so they're kept at ten thousand a year [noise]\nUm and the same timeframe you've seen the number of educators drop from Ninety three to sixty at the last official tally\nWhy is there such a delay and is that delay what spring these women in part to seek services quote unquote underground\nIt's hard to understand why there's such a delay and why there hasn't been a surplus or an addition of educators top speed up the process\nIt's a good question about whether that delays driving people under God of course we don't know causation necessarily but definitely the woman who I was speaking to her opening their homes were finding that\nSurvivors who came to them just didn't want to wait nine years they couldn't wait nine years right\nSo that means that for nine years they don't have the protection of a work permit so they can't necessarily support their children and that's what they used was designed to do to to give people a pathway to residency so that they would be able to leave safely and to support their families\nAnd you know the Obama administration um how do you know had very controversial policies regarding immigration I'm Wondering are these women or concerned under today's circumstances under the Trump Administration or is there equal concern\nUnder the Obama administration if so what's the difference today I was wondering the same thing and I was actually I'm somewhat surprised to learn that does concern is much much higher today than it was under Obama's minister ration the concern of ... and the concern of the concern of deportation a lot of the women who were\nComing to the safe houses essentially under the Obama administration didn't feel as if it was as risky to come\nComing to the safe house is essentially under the Obama administration\nDidn't feel as if it was as risky to come forward to the police they felt as if Obama's deportation priorities were much clear and now those priorities have been widened so broadly that they really just don't know\nOne of the other things I heard a lot in this reporting was that women felt particularly afraid about separation of families it's just all over the news in this way that they believe that\nIt's possible that their family to be separated when these women come to volunteer you know do they ended up staying just temporarily do they end up going back to their abusive partners like what have you seen\nYeah so ... estimates that about half of the women who have stayed with her have\nTo their partners it's really really difficult police\nAnd half of last some stay for a night some stay for two months so it really depends on the woman and Valentino is feeling is it's up to them and she'll do it what works best for them I mean I've met I met some women who are opening their homes who found that the survivors stayed with them for as long as a year\nOne of the problems at the shelter system is that there's an expiration date um if you are if you are lucky enough to find a better than a shelter which is extremely hard to do you often have sixty or Ninety Days maximum and then you have to get out and so these women feel like the least they can do is kind of extend that stay\nWhy does the network need to be a secret\nSome of the women don't necessarily call it a secret and would actually speak about it more publicly others feel as if it's too risky to say I'm bringing in women whose partners are\nAbusing them because they feel as if there's a possibility that abuser will then\nAfter them some of these um have kids they're living with you know and they're trying to protect their families and they're trying to protect their communities and part of it\nAfter them some of these um had kids do the same way you know and they're trying to protect their families and they're trying to protect our communities and part of it gets the survivors themselves want to disappear\nThey feel as if if they can't get a restraining order I don't feel safe going to the police they can't get a restraining order they don't want to live in the same city did their abusers they prefer to move to a different town and start a new life\nAnd so they would prefer if their location was secret and for the women who are opening their homes respect and honor that is there anything we should be thinking about culturally because we are talking about Latinos in particular are there\nAny uh cultural distinctions that come up and dealing with domestic violence there's so much work that needs to be done at the ground level just to get women to feel comfortable talking among people who they know\nAbout what's going on in their home or what's going on in the workplace

from the atmosphere and how that starting to change it's a story we've been focusing on this week here on the world\nToday reporter Sam easing visits with some of the people who lived in the forest pretty much forever and who in some places are the last line of defense against deforestation\nYou might well I've heard the sound of a chain saw in a story about Amazon deforestation a thousand times but this chain saw in the Brazilian state of Maryland yo isn't being used to cut down trees being used to destroy wouldn't timber hall used by a band of illegal loggers [noise]\nMultiple factors Claudio da Silva\nBeing used to destroy a wouldn't timber holler used by a band of illegal loggers [noise]\nWhat will ...\nIs a member of the Amazon squandered jar I Try and the leader of an armed group of indigenous forest protectors called the guardians of the forest illegal logging inland clearing continue to eat away at the world's largest remaining tropical forest\nBut the Guardian's and others like them in Brazil are pushing\nBack [noise]\nOn a recent day the summer of ... and the Guardian's prepare to patrol the ... river a narrow strip of muddy water marking the boundary of the ... seven hundred square mile forest reserve the land is protected on paper but it's under constant threat\nAnd then if they thought it was illegal business if we go looking in our territory da Silva says we always find illegal things going on\nAnd sure enough as we make our way up the river to fill the spot the dugout canoe polled on to the bank on the glaciers are aside [noise]\nWe pull up alongside it jumps out and move quickly of\nA narrow path into the forest their freshmen\nShitty cuts and the brush and then we hear voices of men coming toward us [noise] the Guardian's crouched down for an ambush with their rifles loaded\n\nThe guardian shout out commands three boys [noise]\nSoon the boys are kneeling with hands behind their head\nThey're from the settlement across the river youngest is fourteen they confess to cutting virgin timber to make charcoal valuable product in this impoverished region of Brazil\nThe Guardian's eventually send the boys to their homes across the river with a message to the others don't come back they were lucky this time but it was just some unarmed kids that's a little bit\nLarge I'm like yeah this is a war decillis invaders\nThey were lucky this time but it was just some unarmed kids that's a little bit\nLarge I'm like yeah this is a war does\nThough is that the invaders want confrontation hunters the loggers the farmers here all armed we can die at any time for that as well to Sylvia isn't exaggerating Brazil has become the deadliest country in the world for land defenders like him with more than a hundred and forty killings since two thousand Fifteen\nAnd Mary and you know with a glass jar live is perhaps the most dangerous part of the country with more attacks on the digital age groups here and twenty six team than anywhere else\nJust after this visit the body of one of the some of his fellow guardians from an indigenous territory just south of here was found dumped along the river bank\nFacility himself has received dozens of death threats says it's worth the risk ideas if\n... if I was in for the indigenous he says our wealth as the forest is not gold or whatever out there what we want the forest if you're ...\nIt's a wealth that extends far beyond the glass jars land and even the rest of the Amazon indigenous groups protecting their forests are providing an invaluable service for all of us helping soften the impact of climate change\nFifty six percent of the carbon dioxide we are\nThrowing into the atmosphere is removed back to the ocean for\nCarlos ... is a Brazilian climatologist\nSo this is a tremendous ecosystem service very few people have a vague idea what that means or even of its existence\nFact that deforestation may be driving the entire Amazon and the services it provides to all of us to an alarming tipping point after decades of sucking up huge amounts of C. O. two pollution from the atmosphere of the process seems to have stopped maybe even reversed\nIf that happens or when it does that would mean the end of one of the planet's most power\nAtmosphere of the process seems to have stopped maybe even reversed if that happens or when it does that would mean the end of one of the planet's most powerful buffers against even more dangerous climate change\nMany activists say indigenous groups like the ... are the last best hope for saving the Amazon and other tropical forests and there's evidence to back that up multiple scientific studies have found that the best way to protect for us is to empower the people who live in them\nThe study said this effort to pay off with two to three times lower deforestation rates they also put his billions of dollars worth of benefits from carbon seek restoration clean water and more\nBut it's a David and Goliath battle protected indigenous lands cover nearly a quarter of the Amazon and powerful economic forces are testing their resolve from big ag mining and logging to the global demand for me the way\nThey have allies in the Brazilian government myself also a ... that all congressman\nKnow suddenly now is a leader in power for agribusiness lobby called the rural east us all the towns as Brazil shouldn't be protecting native land's for modern enterprise\nUnder his leadership they're released is in their ally president Michel to mirror have stopped the process for creating new indigenous reserves defunded the agency charged with protecting the rights of indigenous people in her pushing to open existing indigenous territory is to agribusiness and mining\n... is president ... most Indians which houses of on government grants\nInstead he says they should be able to exploit their land and make money they are also William Brazil's indigenous groups generally see this rhetoric is self serving and they're fighting back [noise]\nLast spring more than three thousand indigenous people descended on capital Brasilia for a week of rallies and marches [noise] it was the large\nThree thousand indigenous people descended on the capital Brasilia for a week of rallies and marches [noise] it was the largest indigenous mobilization in Brazil's history [noise]\n\nSonia ... head of the articulation of indigenous peoples or Brazil and the vice presidential candidate organize the event\nThat don't get ill I had no but I Do that\nAre better than your call it that felt like God label\nWe've always lived in a war and Brazil she says the colonization period was marked by death murders in extermination and this hasn't stopped it requires a constant ... costs thanks [noise]\n\nBack at the car indigenous territory cloudy on the field because the regional office the military police for backup the Guardian's have discovered a possible marijuana plantation\nOn their land scale not much believe all the shows like this illicit confronting drug traffickers and the most dangerous kinds of radio shows the next day eight heavily armed\nPolicemen arrive [noise] we entered the forests of the river and head of the past with assault rifles and bulletproof vests checking for trip wires booby trap for a long we find a planted field but it's not hot ... planted my land grabbers after the clear the trees for charcoal [noise]\nThe Guardian's cut and burn the ... but the forest will take decades to recover\nGuild love them I Believe all the shows like sometimes when you see the trees cut down to sort of says we feel rage but we also have a heart so sometimes we pity the outsiders to\nYeah we'll we'll ... we'll follow no direct what they had the Silva says and now they want Iraq what we have this is why we keep fighting so this doesn't happen in ... the for the world Sammy marrying yeah Brazil tomorrow\nWe keep fighting so this doesn't happen in ... the for the world Sammy marrying yeah Brazil\nTomorrow fighting deforestation by trying to make the standing forests more valuable or stories this week come from a partnership with the nation magazine and the PBS NewsHour\nAnd in terms of foreign actors or Russia doesn't surprise me but but what are Iran and Israel up to\nVery similar things similar to Russia we see these networks of accounts focused on their foreign policy objective but what's interesting is that when there's a really contentious domestic issues here in the U.S like the cabinet nomination for example they do turn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue kind of sowing discord which is again really similar\nThe cabinet nomination for example they do turn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue kind of sowing discord which is again really similar to what we saw in twenty sixteen\nOr are these campaigns are targeting specific races and specific states even in\nRaces that have been very high profile for example the crews ... Senate race in Texas right well there is a lot of social media engagement around that race and there are some tactics\nBeing used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and in those races\n[noise] generally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done what\nWe're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect\nCertain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that for an actress can operate through real Americans and ... skate their activity\nAnd in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very device in\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the veteran the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course\nThat's been a a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise that these accounts were trying to\nUm exacerbate that uh that discord\nSpeaking of social media tactics we just heard a story about Facebook working with fact checkers are on the ...\nFord speaking of social media tactics we just heard a story about Facebook working with fact checkers are on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S\nThey are and I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct\nBut what we think about is this information is actually less about the truth or the authenticity in any given story and more about how it's distributed\nIs the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative at one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify this sort of manipulative distribution\n[noise] I I just want to ask you about the the news today a department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concern um it's kind of apples and oranges compared to what we're talking about but it does suggest more Russian meddling\nHow do you see these charges against the concern of more apparent election meddling\nI think this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as cyber warfare and what we started to think about his information warfare are actually won in the same\nAnd the more that we think about these two things as being synonymous are overlapping the more we'll be able to defend ourselves against these types of attacks in the future and thoughtfully engage with our adversaries around what isn't isn't acceptable\nOr you know what are the rules of the road in terms of this ongoing combat between nations that are sometimes friends and sometimes adversaries\nJonathan Morgan is a CEO of new knowledge he also founded data for democracy an organization that looks at ethics in the tech industry Jonathan thanks for being with us thanks for having
