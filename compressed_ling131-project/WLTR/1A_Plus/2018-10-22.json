dispute this account and leading to the press saying the attack was targeted\nAmid the Saudis questionable explanation of ... death a new report from the New York times reveals how the Saudi Government uses troll farms to orchestrate digital attacks against dissidents and journalists including ...\nBen Hubbard into Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting on these social media campaigns\nTroll farms are basically you know the best way to picture then would be like a call center like you would have you know to to field public relations were crusts or customers request something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations or the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this is to attack content that was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that is positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels of the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy is an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that uh say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government said we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of this effort is somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman man who was you know the sort of the fact or ruler of the kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these trolls were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to ...\nAnd what are some of the messages that these drones were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a ... that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that it becomes in a way unreasonable\nThey also try to game the algorithms that Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics\nSo if there is a hash tag that picks up or there's some cases it may have actually been created created by them they can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that and don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important or something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia again this is an authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers are government owned\nThere's not a lot of public engagement or civil society they're not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this is going to be this great new technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really had the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they were able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just they don't they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who's going to our trolls are called er sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on the social media to base of trying to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been ...\nThe base of trying to shape the way that they go they drowned out a lot of messages they they've amplified other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trading list on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective\nAnd um they they they end up playing a real social media plays a very large role in these countries in just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media does in any country\nBut the the differences Saudi Arabia is that they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they got on Twitter they can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them would perceive their own their own government\nBut you also reported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person well we know that\nThere was a Saudi engineer Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then Twitter was basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this person that he hasn't been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using his access to the company and his his access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because a democracy ... death um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns was he not\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed have this last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter he was very prolific on Twitter he would treat an Arabic he would treat an English he would interact with people he would have post articles and\nYou know so so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million\nHe would've post articles and you know so so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views but you know somebody like to have that many followers just on his own Twitter account so\nThey put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments lots and lots of abuse and\nAnd and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list that they were\nYou know trying to influence the way that the content he was putting out as being received by people\nAt least enough to be clear that Twitter as a company has been under\nFire for a while now for what it allows and doesn't allow on its platform and how it controls where people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they are said anything about all this has soaked from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or to how their platform is being used in this instance\nI'm not aware of any direct response from Twitter till the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about other ways that they tried to do this there was you know they put out of information\nA few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of bought network I think they called it that they had taken down to the sort of a pro pro Saudi bought network that Twitter had taken down\nSo you know there there there are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when um Twitter executive speak about this they say you know well we we want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking\nThings down and less otherwise necessary so I I mean I think for Twitter they they're trying to find a balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also stepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are in a fair is\nBen Hubbard is the ... bureau chief for the New York times spending so much

three years more than twenty five hundred candidates were in the running for just two hundred and fifty seats in the run up to the election was extremely tense and deadly threats from the Taliban throughout the country heightened the danger of participating in these elections\nAt least ten candidates as well as dozens of their supporters were killed in the months leading up to Saturday's vote but the day of the election also saw heightened levels of violence although the exact number is unclear targeted attacks lead to more than thirty six people dead on Saturday alone\nSuck ... money was reporting in Afghanistan over the weekend he's a correspondent for the BBC base in Islam\nThan thirty six people dead on Saturday alone ... was reporting in Afghanistan over the weekend he's a correspondent for the BBC base in Islamabad, Pakistan\nWhere there were dozens upon dozens of violent incidents over the past two days in Afghanistan or including a suicide bombing in the north of the capital Kabul and which Fifteen people were killed in that incident we understand a suicide bomber with trying to get inside the polling station when police stopped them from doing that\nAt that moment he blew himself up killing people who are around him but having said that for all the tragic loss of life that that was by us gone standards this wasn't up to cheat Kelly\nFiat set of days many people that fit that there would be in a lot more major attacks I mean I'd been reporting from Afghanistan philosophy a year and a half and and some of the attacks that we've seen in the last few months for example I I I've seen\nFifty people being killed in one single attack them and we didn't see anything like that so from a security perspective that to me\nThat when people who were killed that wherever attacks people why in some cases prevented from voting we already knew going into these elections that are so typical bloating stations across the country we're gonna have to remain closed\nBecause of security concerns\nBought these elections was more peaceful than many fit they would be\nOr they considered democratic by the electorate because of the attacks in the threats and many of the problems we just outlined\nWell enough to understand a lot of people are quite disillusioned with politics after years of violence and corruption\nI see that being and in Afghanistan over the last a week or so that was a lot of people who will also quite optimistic at times because they felt that in these elections are unlike in previous elections and number of the candidates for young

warlords having said that that has been a lot of criticism within Afghanistan of delays that occurred during the election protests are a number of polling stations\nDidn't open on on on Saturday or open late as they were voting hot to be extended into Sunday or what I was at some of the polling stations people would come and tell me that\nDespite having registered they couldn't find any names on the boat to list the rules have problems with the new biometric vote to verification system that was introduced a little bit of a last minute ready\nIt's designed to prevent people both him more than one but because it was introduced so late a load of this stuff it seems one particularly well trained in how to use it and that helped contribute to the today so there has been a lot of\nCriticism of of the organization of these elections\nYou mentioned a lot of the younger more educated candidates that are running I'm Wondering are there any themes are there any common political threats that they share you know something that might be resonating with\nElectorate [noise] the one thing to note is that in in Afghanistan one parliament isn't particularly powerful in comparison to the to the position that the president um\nThe second is that the political parties on really a dominant into parliament most candidates stand as independence even if they are affiliated to political parties because\nPolitical parties in in the country often associated with\nScience journalism and struggle for power so a lot of the people who stand as I say uh\nPolitical parties in in the country often associated with science journalism and struggle for power so a lot of the people who stand as I say our our independence\nAnd that means that they can uh cultivate their own constituencies of support ready to sit and he was still a lot of people who a form of journalists a civil society activists standing and these with some of the people who\nVoted what what quite enthusiastic about alongside them though the rules that are a lot of big businessmen\nUm the the children of former so called warlords who was standing for the first time as well so what a mixed bag of candidates who is standing on a huge number I mean over two thousand five hundred candidates standing across the country in ...\nWhen I was there were eight hundred candidates for thirty three seats set a ballot paper was about Fifteen pages long it's kind of looked like a newspaper but reading\nAnd there were about four hundred women who ran among those candidates what can you tell us about them\nExactly so uh that's more like she got different number from the the number of women who ride it in the last set of parliamentary elections in two thousand and ten to ... around four hundred women who took part in those\nBut as I say that ... number of of women among these candidates who people are are more enthusiastic about um I was speaking to to to one a female candidate she's twenty six year old very well known\nA TV reporter in Afghanistan and she was saying to me that she was standing because uh she viewed the older politicians is basically being corrupt and an acting like a mafia\nOr ... in ... and she wanted a Afghanistan to move away from them as what is the fact that there were there were four hundred women are four hundred old women standing or I think around sixty percent of the candidates while under the age of forty\nAnd what about the current President Asif ...

Ashraf Ghani he's been a president for over four years now does he still have support [noise]\nIf he said he doesn't and in fact one of the reasons why these elections scene is so crucial because next April ... presidential elections and there'll be\nMuch more politically significant because as I say the ... political system is quite centralized to the president really the key to the country and so these parliamentary elections were were meant to have taken place around three years ago they've been today devastated Cincinnati\n... and he just happened now so these elections was seen as a kind of dry run if you if you like for those presidential elections\nPeople wanted to see a wood enough of guns feel safe coming out to vote or will the results be accepted that's another crucial question because a previous elections been marred by allegations of fraud and many fear the same could happen again so\nThese are all key concerns that that people have a about the next few presidential elections and we're hoping to get some kind of indication\nFrom these elections about ...\n... money is that Pakistan and Afghanistan correspondent for the BBC sick under thanks for joining us thank you for having [noise]\nMore for the takeaway come from apple or Europe handmade language learning program\nThat teaches practical conversation in a town and Russian leaders and other languages available and they asked are more on line at me a B.

authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... by the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than that and it would be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell it to you so\nHow many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis\nArms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapons sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some that made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million what she said uh the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory\nOr things are built that are being solved the Saudis it's a different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to arm of murderous regime that's not only kill the journalists but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saturday contracts Boeing and Raytheon you're saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals\nAnd the president talks about Saturday contracts Boeing and raise the on you're saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nAnd there was a big here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages\nSo not all of us have gone through but affecting fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened were worth tens of billions of dollars some of that money has already slowed things started delivering the fifteenth so the money is water under the bridge it's already been spent we're not going to see it again\nThat would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that light changes the deal for a missile defense system called fab which was introduced during the Trump period and they've got to agree on the details so in theory the Saudis can say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia's whole military is built on us in UK supplied weapons communications maintenance and spare parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production and how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much is that is reliant on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy\nAnd not all that has weapons and then the Saudi peace is a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say so it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb is built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate\nWhere a particular bomb has built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up\nI think partly he likes to show up and sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people and the American worker and you can see that as trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crimes of the Saudi regime because he wants to team up with them a and going after Iran\nWas built any mock heads the ... council and Alaska based in Anchorage she grew up in shifts\nChurch and the bureau of Indian affairs school\nWas built any mark heads the any what Cirque in polar council in Alaska based in Anchorage she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island her ancestors lived all along this part of the coasts and they use the island frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing that they were kind of semi nomadic um we didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nThat all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches in schools\nIt was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states Alaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah Jeff island\nSo this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department she set out to get federal agencies to help protect people in coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change ... and other towns were already engaged in planning their own solutions but the sticking point was money\nMoving a whole town is a complicated and expensive affair one federal study peg the cost of living ... at a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd it's just rough doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water\nBut Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept that human caused climate change is even real funny\nSupportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept the human caused climate change is even real\nThe funding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some grant money and some grant program spun up but uh boy it's just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars it within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change climate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ...\nAnd he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because you you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory or it's fact and of course I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a whiff of climate change to it ah has to stop\nThen a few months

but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should the state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll they'll be saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there\nAre in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's going to happen in the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on our own rights and and that's one of the things that makes this country great\n[noise]\nI reach out twice to the department of the interior for comment but they did not respond\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is why don't people just leave ... like if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents just go somewhere else known are fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's a cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them to just assimilate into another village somewhere a is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which I think it's just horrible [noise]\nI met ... seem to agree on this they
