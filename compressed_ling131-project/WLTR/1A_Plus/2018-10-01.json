joining me now to discuss this issue arena Ahmed freelance sports writer and co host of the burning all down podcast Shereen thanks for being with us\n[noise] Hi thanks for having me something that we need some of your guidance on this story here so let's go over the basics of this who is the woman in question Katherine my your gut and how did she and wrote Ronaldo first meet\nWell Kevin Oregon is actually from Las Vegas Nevada at the time she was twenty five and we're talking about the ... occurred in two thousand nine she was\nWorking at a night club and she was an aspiring models slash actress and she was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which has a policy I guess you get this entourage\nSo he according to their Spiegel article and her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't sure\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warning for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has a story that he's a documented a sane Christiana are known to him\nIt gets his entourage so he according to the dirt Spiegel article in her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't shore\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warning for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has the story that he's a documented a sane Christiana run all to himself in a conversation with his lawyer has actually said that she said no several times she said stop so this is part of what happened and he confirmed that in his own words\nSo I mean afterwards she was in shock as most survivors are\nShe didn't know what to do and she was very intimidated by him and under and then when she confided in somebody finally who advised her to go to the hospital and file a police report\nYou know everybody's reaction was saying oh it's but he's so big so powerful and you'll get lost in the so coupled with her own trauma and the mounting fear of who he was because this isn't some too but player in a semi pro league this is arguably one of the best players and aspiring at that time\nSo it was you know it's pretty pretty mortified and she knew what she'd be up against it didn't help that her first lawyer was not\nAs experienced and couldn't guide her the way that needed to be but I mean she was an aspiring actress she didn't have twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with the system\nShore and this is a this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where has the U.S media been on this story at this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nUm and I will say this very honestly is because I'm part of the ...\nPretty mortified and she knew what she'd be up against it didn't help that her first lawyer was not as experienced and couldn't guide her the way that needed to be but I mean she was an aspiring actress she didn't have twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with a system\nShore and this is I I this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where has the U.S media been on this story this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on\nThis story um and I will say this very honestly as because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because\nThis is first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five barely won anywhere it made no wage they think I just found a blurb on the guardian about when I started this research myself\nAnd one of my co host friend also had been talking about this for a long time we want to do examining we pitched this story about sixteen different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know\nThe reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that Cristiano Ronaldo has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nAnd that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not as popular here I Would argue as maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think this is applicable here as well\nAbsolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlets [laughter] and no one wanted to them or nobody wanted to store and I'm like how can this not be possible that this isn't the first time this happened to me same thing with David\nTeam if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nAnd that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not um as popular here I Would argue as maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think this is applicable here as well\nAbsolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlets [laughter] and no one wanted to them or nobody wanted to store and I'm like how can this not be possible that this isn't the first time this happened to me\nSame thing with David ... the current goalkeeper from Manchester United was also just before the euro's implicated in a very brutal rape case a sexual assault of two workers sex workers but also we\nWe should also be clear though that that he that that ... has responded and denying these allegations right\nWell of course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid Catherine my or a three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars in NDA like let's not forget that that happened then she has the documentation I mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that\nYour speakers would not and this is something we have to address when we talk about media would not have printed that saved dotted the ... and ... and legal has gone over this a hundred times if Christie honor and all those teams going to sue ... would have done a year and a half ago to have an even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nRight and it and it also is interesting to me that we are in this moment this me to moment\nI'm particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry a is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a real lack of attention to this given for example the Larry nuts are stories that have come out in the sports world and other issues so I'm I'm really surprised that the lack of attention from the American media

sixteen year old the New York state will no longer automatically be charged as adults in criminal court next to the so called raise the age legislation passed last year\nAs a result sixteen and Seventeen year old being detained at New York city's notorious Rikers Island jail have to be moved out by to day New York in North Carolina where the last two states in the nation to make this change here to bring us up to speed on these two huge changes to New York criminal justice system is our dear friend Cindy Rodriguez\nThan he covers urban affairs here in our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before\nCindy thanks for being with us high tens enough good to be here so what exactly are the changes going into effect today one is regarding housing and the other one is how the sixteen year olds are being charged right right that's correct so said this law will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nAnd but they're facing it in so this is the start of the law said this is the first phase of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case\nSystem is our dear friend Cindy Rodriguez Cindy covers urban affairs here at our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before Cindy thanks for being with us high Tenzing is going to be here so what exactly are the changes going into effect today one is regarding housing and the other one is how the sixteen year olds are being charged right right that's correct so said this\nLaw will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds and but they're phasing it in so this is the start of the law so this is the first phase of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court if it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been especially youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm if the case involves sexual assault if it involves any serious physical injury if it involves a weapon um it will stay in this youth part an adult criminal court\nOtherwise it will go to family court unless a prosecutor claims there's extraordinary circumstances and the judge agrees with that than the case will stay\nAnd what about this move that at the sixteen and Seventeen year old to have to be moved out of Rikers Island which we know has been the center of so much controversy around or just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera so today the day and what's happening yes that's true too so another\nTo mention is that this law has not retroactive so that means if you're already serving in prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and Rikers Island and just to give a freer national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country um it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place so if you are the\nAnd uh just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera so today the day and what's happening\nYes that's true too so another thing to mention is that this law has not retroactive so that means if you're already serving a prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and Rikers Island and just to give a freer national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country um it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you are there um that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything um your case will continue through the adult criminal justice system but you will be moved off the island and in fact as of yesterday I was told that all Ninety three sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nThat were on Rikers Island are now out of there now let's talk about where they're going to go so they're going to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx\nAnd so they've all been moved there\nNow why this pushed for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this uh this change\nSo there's there's been it said the laws years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in twenty fourteen when federal prosecutors started investigating how sixteen and Seventeen year olds were being treated\n'em an Rikers Island and they found that guards were using\nExcessive force on them they were striking them in the head repeatedly they were over using solitary confinement\nUm and so that was part of the effort to get them off of Rikers Island I'm In addition to that\nSo there's there's been it said the laws years in the making

Browder who is in Rikers in ... he was arrested for stealing a backpack\nUm that case was ultimately dismissed but he stayed there for three years he\nWas in solitary confinement he was attacked by other inmates and by correction officers and he was very traumatized by that experience um he was out on Pete his family couldn't meet the three thousand dollars bail\nSo when he came out um his story was told by this journalist Jennifer Gunderman from the New Yorker it got a lot of attention\nUm then he started suffering a lot with mental health issues and ultimately he killed himself so all of that is sort of the backdrop of where we are today and there's been\nUm lots of talk particularly from uh New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan to essentially shutdown Rikers Island um it's complex by twenty twenty seven twenty twenty seven I'm of course where all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly\nHow does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half\nParticularly from uh New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan to essentially shutdown Rikers Island um and it's complex by twenty twenty seven twenty twenty seven I'm of course we're all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly\nHow does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop it to about five thousand [noise]\nSo um [noise] this is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mentioned that to move people off the jails is to close down Rikers Island is going to be controversial so the plan is that\nThe city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up new jails in Burroughs um so these would be burrow based shows that are more integrated into the community\nUm to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process\nAnd there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are flooded for and there's been tremendous opposition\nSo far what about you mentioned clique prouder and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people in and out\n[noise] um right so there is a whole debate about it and an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which\nUm seems like it won't happen there is though something pretty interesting that's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis massive bailout that's being planned by the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and say that\nAbout ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people\nIn and out [noise] um right so there is a whole debates about it and an effort to change the way the bill system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which\nUm seems like it won't happen there is though something pretty interesting that's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis mass and bailout that's being planned by the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and say that I'm mass bailout is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nAnd women who are incarcerated um there's about five that's about five hundred people\nUm they were trying to raise five million dollars and the ... supposed to happen through out the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see some of these people being bailed out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting the city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids every part\nOf the planning process has been guided by this principle Finney Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us indeed thank you ...\nNot to comment for this show us up on our Facebook page we had to take away or leave us a voice mail at age seven seven eight my tape your ideas I have a huge part of who we are let us know what you're thinking about\nNot a comment finish out on our Facebook page Sweden sat in a tank land or leave us I'm smelling a seven seven eight my tank she joined the anti have huge part of who we are let us know what you're thinking about\nIn LA [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is Walter regular South Carolina from a to Z be is a brown ...

imagery helped advance the investigation into an atrocity committed a few years ago more on the science in the investigation in a moment the story begins as I said\nWith an atrocity [noise] this is a moment from a video that went viral this summer and it's a killing is about to take place soldiers are walking to prisoners down a road you can just about here one of the soldiers whistling all of Conrad is filming and commenting\nOn the law suit [noise] you know reduce him over to\nThe prisoners are two women plus a young child and a baby [noise]\nAs I said with an atrocity [noise] this is a moment from a video that went viral this summer and it's a killing is about to take place soldiers are walking to prisoners down the road you can just about here one of the soldiers whistling all of Conrad is filming and commenting\nOn not allowed to [noise] you know ... plus\nThe prisoners are two women plus a young child and a baby [noise]\nTwenty two shots were fired in all the women and the children were killed\nBut it was unclear who was shooting or where this happened at first glance against might be that it's somewhere in Africa but that's about it\nThen a team from the BBC's Africa I investigative unit went to work and thanks to science and technology they managed to zero in on not just where these killings happened but also the identity of the likely shooters those alleged shooter's are now in custody\nTell me a lot of people the b._b._c. African security correspondent joined us from Nairobi a really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually practice case\n[noise] well I think first of all there was just the shock\nThat gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning and it began you know just conversations across to each other with different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is it's anybody have any idea\nWhat what this terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a full on investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology play in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean there are parts of this whole ...\nStations across Twitter though a different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is it's anybody have any idea what the what the terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started and lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on the ice and became a full on investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in and then getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology play in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean there are parts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is wide across west in Central Africa a botched\nWith many heads put together a one of them was Amnesty International the rights group which had been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know looking at the uniforms\nListening to some of the dialogue and it's um an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was camera and this was northern capital of course that's also a vast region but over time trying to match the topography as you can see in the video there are ... distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and\nUsing those reached lines matching them to Google or in digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location\nThat's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that ritual on match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only red line that has that shape and all of camera room\nPainstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy but they won't so many clues put together so it's not just the rich line I could be any ridge land but when you have\nRight as using geo location that's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that rich line match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only red line that has that shape and all of common room\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy but\nThey'll ... so many clues put together so it's not just the rich line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue and you have another clue you sort of bring them together and that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed was his when they did not so going back in time and\nLooking at different elements of that and adding everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also worked with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experience in this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible\n[noise] well first of all the government tried to deny initially that these were Cameroon and soldiers they said you know the uniform on was not watch um the the soldiers would wear up north\nUm they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army also found some of the the uniforms\nBoy indeed ... military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and found that those were Kembrew Indian soldiers but then\nIn the dialogue as well some of the soldiers was saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy but around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tune\nOne of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army also found some of the the uniforms boy indeed calmer when you're in military uniforms and and so we were able to to festival identify and found that those were Kembrew Indian soldiers but then\nIn the dialogue as well some of the soldiers were saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy\nBut around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they change their tone and said well they had the rest at seven people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official names and so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details\nYou're out of your parents still you know you've found church on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier colds ... and apart from just to Facebook you know we found a way to speak to a former kind of ruined young soldier who also confirmed that this was indeed Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out in the team been able to find out any possible motive for the violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these uh women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram and there's a point\nWhere I Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of a tell this child that I'm Sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and um basically saying it's it's your parents' fault that you are getting killed as well um so\nAny possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these uh women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram and there's a point where I Am I'm One\nOf the soldiers sort of a tells us child that I'm Sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and\nUm basically saying it's it's the parents' fault or you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers in affording these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback or to this investigation has the b._b._c. Africa gotten from the public like from Cameroon and Nigeria itself\nThe feedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by the method you know the location the use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the angle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time\nWhen exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fired up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a cameraman and people in particular but I had been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and their forces accountable\nVideo or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult\nTo tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fired up the audiences I'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a camera and people in particular but had been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and their forces accountable\nVideo or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to uh to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen it festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock and it's something you can't really you race from your from your mind so\nTo attend can't is you know pretty remote it very far\nFrom El Paso which I think is the closest city there's not a lot of vegetation is just you know I think the picture's really speak for themselves there's rows and rows of those tents that are that children living quarters or they have a couple other facilities on site in dining facilities and the like but\nBut it you know it is remote and it and\nIt feels like you're kind of in the middle of the other\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on that how how does it do the\nYou know let's say that a child was moved from essentially where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty giant so much more of a homey environment they have access to education so they'll wrists\nTents that are the children living quarters or they have a couple other facilities on site dining facilities and the like but but it's it you know it is remote and it um it feels like you're kind of in the middle of the other\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale ... makes kids more vulnerable than you were ... ... ... how does that do the\nYou know let's say that a child was moved from a facility where there were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty children so much more of a homey environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects learn some English the also have regular attention will have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experienced some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving\nAnd or possibly in route and so\nAnd so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access that they need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like twenty of this emergency facility we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um ... the kids you know we were told the kids get work books but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it but you know\nThey've just been transition there from a different facility and they don't know anyone there disoriented possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stable I think\nYou're a member mind kind of ... when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean you have any legal help if they can access\nKinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it\nBut you know they've just been transition there from a different facility and they don't know anyone there disoriented possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stable I think\nYou're a member of mine kinda bottles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but\nYou know by and large children at the permanent shelters are provided with an you know no you're right presentation um they receive screening and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues um\nYou know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the time came facility and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we had a system\nWe have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in this country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in the system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nFor those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the process doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's a chronic\nLack of investing in a system we we need to prioritize getting kids out of

getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not a ... it's not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know what I Am hopeful and the thing that I think I'm I'm I'm\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know\nDoing a lot of visits certainly to different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from from a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously it's one thing to have that versus\nYou know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to releasing children to appropriate and safe sponsors as soon as possible\nLead to trouble as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much\nPresident Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency this change would essentially mean anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing\nAnd you know releasing children to appropriate and safe sponsor and as soon as possible\nLeader travel as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much\nPresident Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency\nThis change would essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen that happening but loosely is a pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule as a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services\nThat include healthcare Nutrition Assistance so your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to childhood family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still in the proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future and this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even wake or the women infants and children program and four months\nServices that include healthcare Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country so really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to child and family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nOf this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even ... or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you can tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so as recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as with many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so as she was also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed our food assistance but she declined I'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S\nSo I worry about this baby and many babies and similar situation\nTime doing so as she was also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined I'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S\nSo I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all the support that they could get if their families were not being placed in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either\nStability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice for the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean there's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately of an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so which\nWhich really is a lifeline for a lot of my family as they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nAnd the state's right and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately have an

the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nProvides healthy foods and includes housing assistance um in other services that actually allows them to be healthy and stable so that they can contribute to the United states to our economy to our society\nDr learn rifle lose a pediatrician in
