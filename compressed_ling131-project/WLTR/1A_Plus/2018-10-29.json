was really afraid for my safety in my life\nI think most Americans these days with the they didn't ever think about um being afraid for their lives when they go to the movies or when they go to a dance club I mean this is something I feel that's clearly different\n[noise] yes well it is it is there's no doubt about it but we shouldn't lose sight of what we said earlier throughout the United

we saw two presidents assassinated within Twenty years of one another certainly in the Nineteen sixties and seventies I think that you know terrorism hate crimes\nRest and sit along the fault lines of our society what we're seeing right now you're quite right is far more acute now that it's being in our modern memories but don't forget one Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorist bombings in the United states\nSo this is not this is in terms of the violence unprecedented but in terms of the mood that both of you in ... described I mean absolutely there's been a change I think that the security we felt recent years has almost completely eroded\nFree let's talk about that a little bit because I'm you've done or perhaps one of the most visible acts of resistance when you took down the Confederate flag down a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to these uh recent events\n[noise] well I think that most of us view this as a resurgence of violence that has been a constant in this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical to try to lump lights the premises violence and with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacist terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has been you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing ham because a number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents who were trying to vote part of the problem of lumping white supremacist terrorism and with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacy of terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream steak and the politics a lot of use that\nIs that white supremacy is terrorism is unique in America that it has a mainstream steak and the politics a lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacist terrorists are not far removed from the views that are being espoused by the geo Pete and particularly by Trump you don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as his lab at Islamic terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for American society America is not\nA majority Muslim nation however the ideology of white supremacy is very much in the mainstream of America now of course we have come we have made a lot of progress from where we were in the past but to discuss what is happening now in a way that discount\nBe centuries and generations

afternoon at three [noise]\nIs the takeaway with tens and Vegas from WNYC NPR I publish radio international in collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston\nWhen American voters head to the polls next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle\nThe winners of the midterms have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map it happens every ten years and it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level here\nTo explain more is Denise Ross barber she's the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to this\nJust federally but also at the state level here to explain more is Denise Ross barber she's a managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to the takeaway thank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after the twenty\nTwenty census is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and re draw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\nJust where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or new congressional districts need to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district and that may have to get rearranged into two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district\nI mean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can just keep adding to the number of congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust the lines get drawn with regards to who's in what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change\nAnd what kind of a role is redistricting playing in our upcoming midterm elections\nA vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that currently twenty nine governors and more than eight hundred state legislators who are in this year's\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new maps so it's a fairly important process that takes place every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who\nIt's every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team because they won't be up in twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting pens\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors where are you seeing as far as money concern\nIn addition to the fact that the U.S house is at play in terms of flipping from Republican to Democrat\nThis is a very serious and major election at the state level because most states hold their big races during the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to Gallup PTA there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip\nBased on the upcoming election so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee which is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat\nUm and his group to NBRC has given directly to state candidates and political parties almost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Pennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gay fifty thousand dollars in support of Ohio redistricting measure and this is just money that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have data on how much money\nMoney that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have data on how much money these entities and others are spending independently on state races\nI mean you said it's hard to tell how much money they're spending independently are we able to find out who's funding efforts in state and local races\nCertainly the look we're able to know who is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective was that for them in terms of redistricting well\nI mean they obviously took clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers were most vulnerable and which seats within those chambers were most\nVulnerable and really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country or in at least a vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also swung Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting\nNot at all [laughter] no okay so if they don't why not I mean this seems to be so critical it's a critical use of our sense is that the critical thing for those of us who want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think this issue\nSo far sense is that the critical thing for those of us you want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think this issue is so overlook or misunderstood or not understood at all\nRight I I think because most people are just trying to get through their day in their year and they're worried more about their health insurance and whether or not they have a job and you know who draws a redistricting boundaries this kind of politically ...\nThe whole process involves just a lot of ... and it's really\nA game that's played primarily by the insiders are the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are paying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the Andy RC\nAre very aware of it Denise Ross barber is managing director of

targeted by the Chinese government for his activism before that he was working in relative obscurity in Beijing in the mid nineties and for some years in New York City I look back on those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you talk about the winter then you come to spring here come to summer more and more pressures of time\nHis new book capture some of those times it's called I way way Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand and three and several photos he documents the final days of his father I ... what a China is fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities\nAfter he passed away I feel you feel you're alone and they don't belong to anybody and uh and maybe that's a moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically prepared and for me to become a\nNew ball suffer myself a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us a story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that defense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society I recently have clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nOr even he wants the same generation is a ... state leaders chairman mall drawing the line of people\nThey were together but uh but he was heavily criticized or serve artist in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle with now oh yeah yeah they're really core which is supported the ruble\nParty so your father was in that inner circle with no oh yeah yeah they're really core which is support to sort of evolution or part of their own ...\nBundle eight of course have being kicked out or from the party has untied revolution and uh spend about two ... two years so yeah I ... well not just allowed to ride a words his name's totally disappeared in the public\nSince a memorial how did that memorial first they decided to his body has to be covered by communist flack is very high on there\nAnd that means you're you're a part of it is a revolution but I feel ... uncomfortable\nYou know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know it's may against his will\nSo I made that argument as has made them needs covers out a flag\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said you'll find that doesn't just beyond your family you know which is very good argument and they say are we sending arms to the Communist Party or state\nWas it a convincing argument though no it's not it's a ... for me and say insulting to some mind now and has suffered so much\nThat they are being covered by that piece of read but I think it\nIs is is a Hummer and how to cause that sickle sickle yeah on it\nFor me it's brutal [noise] hurts me and then there were the flowers flower as this kind of Sarah money they owe you same sad to have a paper flowers you know\nIf someone used then the next day a week later somebody dies they oh yeah yeah yeah same I I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use an isn't being used\nThey have a week later somebody dies\nThey oh yeah yeah yeah same I I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use an isn't being used before\nSo they say why they're going to do I said I Will buy fresh ours my father's point his art has said he he lived for us so much relate to the highest static judgment on a moral judgment\nSo I said I have to change it so we send out a A R people to bald all they'll fight forest in Beijing city wow I never made a fresh for\nBad so he can sleep in the middle but still covered by this red blanket while\nYour father was ill you did this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smash teaching dynasty ... dynasty earned and you were photographed smashing another and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying\nJust not really much ideas is really attitude or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action you see ... to that kind of ... and all the time\nWas your intention to shake up the Chinese public\nKnow was not possible you'll have no path for\nThe rest of society is in deep sleep and they don't care\nIt was interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing your finger\nAt the Hong Kong's skyline appointing her middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger\nJust so sad to serve your belly and king a drought and now I realize that don't do that anymore because\nWhat is up with the finger\nIs just so sad to say about him king a drought and now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm a girl or whatever you know [noise] and the U.S individual in this society what I was kind of do I mean it's just give out opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't race sinks outweigh you know on the surface racing on the shallow surveys yes us are defending individual rights are human rights\nBut deeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as you were removed\nTo the end of the reality is about how you you as a nation still have a power to accept the difference still have an edgy are still young enough to take the challenge and have a vision and a\nAnd a half of the big heart so if they don't then they will push people way they'll blame other people and they just shows that we can is\nAnd if that big heart starts to shrink while you're here you're going to turn your eye and your critique toward the United states or at least make your critics in your art of China more universal and maybe I'm to the U. S.\nI always protect the basic rights of freedom of speech and uh humor rise I don't see that the only as a Chinese problem\nI always protect the basic rights of freedom of speech and a human rights I don't see that the only it's a Chinese problem it's universal problem\nI weigh ... thank you very much for your time it was an honor and a great pleasure to meet you\nThank you nice to be here [noise]\nCheck out my selfie with I way way and the really cool thing about it I wake up good because you know skill you can see it at the world dot O. R. G. [noise]\nHow much of the fall is frozen or not frozen\n... it's an eco system ecologist and she's been researching Arctic plant here an obvious goes Sweden for the last six years\nShe hasn't pushed the probe into the soil very far at all before it hit something something that sounds like a big not as soon as she pulls a pro back out and then if you touch this\nIs really really cool\nIt's not a soul she pulls the pro back out and then if you touch this\nWow it was really really called ...\n... ...\nIn just a few seconds the end of the pool has become so cold that it's uncomfortable to touch it's almost eerie like it picked up a message for us from the hidden world right under our feet the world of permafrost\nIt can be anywhere from a meter to a kilometer sick it can be very very cold or just barely frozen and all around the Arctic it's starting to fall you might have seen some of the pictures roads that are sinking and buckling homes shifting and cracking and trees tilting an awkward\nAngles giving rise to the label drunken forests in fact there's a line of telephone poles next to the ... and I are standing in one of them will to little drunken to\nThat one that is kind of tilting now that is probably standing in an area where the ... just disappearing now so they will have to redo that soon for people who live in the Arctic these changes are really big deal and many northern cultures sellers cut into the permafrost have been a reliable way to store food it becomes nature's freezer\nNow people can't always trust that their food won't spoil\nAnd thawing permafrost affects all of the newer kinds of infrastructure to not only buildings water mains sewage dreams even cemeteries\nCommunities are scrambling to adapt to the ground literally shifts beneath them but ... says permit process important to all of us no matter where we live because it's providing a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo the permafrost that we have here was formed probably in the during the last ice age so like eleven thousand years or so ago and the material in the ... is that old like it is made up\nDuring the last ice age so like eleven thousand years or so ago and the material in the ... is that old like it is made up out of material from plants that use to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so when ... says the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and then start sauce\nAnd so then one from a frost ... starts to truly saw than than carbon just kinda comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere\nUm because microbes are eating it and they are aspiring so they are briefing basically and then they emit carbon\nSo it's a micro breath that we have to worry about [laughter]\nBasically [laughter] microbes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn up a basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as messing or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them stalling speeds them backup\n\nBack at the lake Matilda rose up close to a big funnel floating upside down in the water that has a big syringe feed it onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty homemade because they are\nThe way we make them float disposable using ... noodles things from using swimming pools\n[laughter] so you take your phone will turn it upside down\nBy using pool noodles extinction with using the swimming pool [laughter]\nSo you take your phone will turn it upside down rather piece of pool noodles around the wide part and put a plastic syringe on the top and you've got yourself a little trap designed to capture gases bubbling up from the lake below\nMatilda wrote us up to another child and your team reaches over the side of the boat with a syringe in his hand\nSo he's pulling out the gas\nSo what's a middle leaders of gosh they're just used to be ... intellect sediments\nA words from the bubble and the global travel through the water into our trip no insurance they likely captured a mixture of gases most of which will likely thing but we're not sure so we take these to laugh and then we measure the actual ...\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these scientists have forty or these bubble traps on this lake and a bunch more nearby they check all of them multiple times a week all summer long\nAnd this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular conditions groups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon stored here in the first we're trying to actively to figure that out [noise]\nYour team said it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex but it's also hard because humans have never warmed up planet up like\nThe missions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never warmed up planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective we're in what climate scientists call him no analog situation a massive global experiment\nThere's not that we turn on the uptick Arctic permafrost machine or we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop turning up [noise]\nIf you have a warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because there are many ah thresholds that you might cross there's\n... a very says that in many parts of the Arctic the permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon and in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that pay the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something that ... that\nWe might tip the scales of these really large exchanges then it can have really dramatic consequences\nIt's not about saving the polar bear I think a lot of people and I think about how much it you know some plants will disappear the pull up it's cute but but it's also about like us surviving as a species because if it gets much warmer\nLike the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we like the food that we eat\nAnd where we live it's just not adapted to it\nDon't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point scientists call it a positive feedback\nBut we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point scientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon in the process just\nThat we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment for conducting on the Arctic or if he's not the damage was already done and now we just have to ride it out [noise] [noise]\nNo we have an ability to stop [noise] of course we do we have choices and [noise]\nI think especially in the western world in which will we have choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um [noise]\nOne of the ways is to try and understand this experiment better and that's my part that's what we do here and the other part is acting on what we already know which is stuffed putting so much greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [noise] yeah I I think we have a responsibility and
