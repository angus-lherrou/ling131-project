R. G.\nWe're back with you on the take away today I'm ten senior Vega in a video released this week Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren backed up her long contested claimed that she has Native American and\nTina Fey guy in a video released this week Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren backed up her long contested claimed that she has Native American ancestry with results from a DNA test and the telling of her family story\nMy mother was born in eastern Oklahoma\nIndian Territory until just a few years earlier when it had become\nMy daddy always said he fell head over heels in love with my love for me for\nMy daddy's parents herrings were bitterly to their married 'cause my mother's family read was part Native American\nPresident Trump has long punted warns claims of native ancestry and even ... her Pocahontas the accusations surrounding warns ancestry date back to two thousand and twelve when her Republican challenger for the Senate Scott Brown accused warn of using her Native American heritage to advance her career\nBrewer is a contributing editor for tribal affairs that high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation Hi Graham Hi what was your reaction to Elizabeth Warren's decision to take this test and put out this video\nI thought it was very interesting I Want to be very clear I'm not here to discredit her story or the common knowledge of her family that that she's been passed down\nI was more concerned about the way it was talked about and and I think the method this conversation with Elizabeth Warren and also President Trump has been very problematic from the beginning\nAnd I think using a DNA test to\nValidate that history ... was probably the wrong approach [noise] it's\nInteresting there because you don't want to criticize gets her intentions for doing this but then it was actually what she did write the message the way that it was done was the issue a DNA test itself\nDoing this but then it was actually what she did write the message the way that it was done was the issue a DNA test itself was it that it was covered by the media inappropriately\nIt's all of the above when we're covering Indian country weren't covering tribal communities we have to take not just look at the language we use but the way we talk about them\nThe problem I had with senator warns approach was that it kind of fosters a narrative that has damaging to native people\nTo give you a little bit of context I I have a very similar story to Senator Warren I Am not much darker than she is a outwardly the place where that video shot is probably just a couple of miles from my home I live in Norman, Oklahoma and that's where I'm Talking to you from now\nAnd so I don't fault her for wanting to know more about her history or in fact I Would encourage her to do so\nBut I I think when you invite people to talk about the degree of of your blood quantum which is the degree of your Indian blood which is something that is documented by the government and in my case certainly you're opening up two conversations that feed into stereotypes and Mets about native people\nBlood quantum is a very a thorny subject it's an institution of colonialism it was something that was put in place to essentially weed out our levels of of of native blood so by putting a stop on me a degree to which you're allowed to join your tribe which is\nA choice that tribes are able to make as they are sovereign nations\nThen it makes it less likely that your children will be able to be tribal members if they don't have the same amount of Indian blood is you do my tribe for instance the Cherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member\nUm to say that someone who is one eight that has more\nCherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member um to say that someone who is one eighth as more of a say or is more native than someone who is one thirty second for instance\nI I think is wrong I'm we're not just talking about a racial distinction here we're talking about a political distinction this was a citizenship question I Am a citizen of a sovereign nation as well as being a descendent of an indigenous person\nCan you help us understand a little bit more when you talk about blood quantum what does that mean in the Native American community so when the\nGovernment put many of us on the trail of tears\nMy great great great grandfather for instance they wrote his name down where he was from and where he was headed to\nThat record still stands and it makes it easy to easier to trace my lineage back to my Cherokee roots\nThat way I can show the nation that I Am a descendent of this person I Am a member of this nation and I can be enrolled us such now some tribes have blood quantum in place uh my my son for instance has also part-time Iowa\n... the ... nation of Oklahoma you have to be one fourth\nPilot to join the Navajo Nation is similar\nBut when it comes to DNA tests I think we need to keep in mind that a DNA test doesn't prove that you are a Native American there is no\nDNA test to shed say definitively you are an indigenous person when it comes to tribal issues DNA tests or use to show who your parents are to show that lineage to show that you are a descendent of this person it's not a test that you can take to say yes I Am\nKyle or or I Am Cherokee or I Am Navajo\nI'm Wondering in terms of the media coverage of this did you feel like native perspective we're being included in the reaction to senator Morris decision um to released this video I've\nIf we're being included in the reaction to senator warrants decision um to release this video I felt\nLike there was a lot of attention given to Senator Warren how she feels about Trump's rhetoric towards her which I Will agree is is not okay it's not acceptable the way President Trump speaks to her about race but\nI felt there was more emphasis on how Senator Warren was affected by it rather than how her response affects indigenous people I think\nHer response helps foster this narrative that like I said her blood quantum is important or that have DNA tests can prove that your indigenous\nNeither one of those things are true in reactions I have seen from indigenous scholars writers and just regular tribal members off the street is is mostly one of anger they're not happy with the way that this has shaped the public discussion\nThey don't feel like Senator Warren has made efforts to understand them or their perspective and they feel again like\nTheir own narrative is being perverted and the public eye I think we need to keep in mind that when we're talking about indigenous communities we're talking about some of the most isolated communities in the country and I don't just mean physically yes some of those communities are isolated physically\nBut there is an invisibility problem with Indian country non native people by and large don't understand Indian country they don't understand sovereignty they don't understand a tribal membership and they don't understand like I was saying that this is a citizenship question as well as a racial distinction\nI think all of those things together just compound the problem of misperceptions and stereotypes that permeates popular culture when it comes to Native American people\n... brewer is a reporter with the high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation grand thanks so much for your insights thanks for having [noise]\nThanks for having

Hernandez professor of law at Fordham University and the author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights also with us is David ... author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center\nAnd Tanya I Want to pick up with you what is the driving force behind men in particular some men of color to have joined this group is it racism is it ...\nIt is both I mean talk about a parody medic intersection all example that is the conflation together of both ... anti gender bias and race bias the ways in which this is I guess you know you would say very toxic white mass\nThe jet anti gender bias and race bias the ways in which this is I guess you know you would say for a toxic white masculinity and men of color are no exception to sort of\nBeing seduced by the superficial power that that ah offers up is it becoming easier to sell in this current climate it is most definitely easy to sell because it combines both\nA quotes of Martin Luther king about not being racist at the same time that he talks about whiteness as being a culture that is worth uplifting as if you could take away from this ah racism\nI'm just curious how it is that people of color who are not by definition white kid engage with that type of thinking\nUp because what they do is they disassociate this idea of white and it says culture from racism and any anti blackness has also reduce the idea of a sudden about black they say it's about bad black culture\nDavid what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this a new form of hate group ideology that we're seeing across the United states [noise]\nIn some ways it's actually very old I mean I started doing this when I was covering the area and nations in Idaho in late seventies early eighties and date to claim that they were only for a white [laughter]\nAnd it's one of the realities of for its promises groups is that\nYou know they'll claimed to just be pro white and defending white interests but you know but I Believe they're pro white advocacy becomes a tax on other races but that it's not how they sell themselves and of course what really is the underlying dynamic here\nIs less white supremacist them than authoritarianism and that's what they're selling and authoritarianism crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries I'm you know\n... that's what they're selling and authoritarianism crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries I'm you know we've got one of our main sort of a ... boy groups out here on the west coast is called patriot prayer\nAnd they're headed by a guy who's Japanese American and his right hand man is big Simone guy so uh yeah ... and I see all kinds of non white guys joining their rights\nBut when I talk to them every one of them has what we call it right wing authoritarian personality\nTania you wanted to weigh in here what can I just wanted to throw in the idea that um it's not new but yes it is in some respects and and as much as that now these white supremacist groups are claiming to be welcoming to people of color\nI'm not just that they're pro white and this is just about culture and that they're not actually racist but they were OK with having non white members be part of their bandwagon\nI'm and while they may be very much about authoritarianism and I agree with you there\nThey're also spouting lots of pro white rhetoric and I don't think we should be dismissing status of say in his budget has about authoritarianism it doesn't mean that fight about race\nYeah no that's absolutely right um\nIt it is this very interesting mix and it's also it's an interesting mix of all the new because ah they're marketing it in ways that I mean to always the radical right was very backward looking and this shape of the ... radical right as very\nSavvy very media savvy and very forward looking which is a problematic\nWell I also want to talk about the initial response to this here at least in New York City um the NYPD the New York police department said on Monday that it did have plans to arrest a nine members of the Proud Boys and three more anti fascist opponents but\nFootage from the fight that night shows the police arriving they disperse the crowd but none of the Proud Boys actually\nJust opponents but footage from the fight that night shows the police arriving they disperse the crowd but none of the Proud Boys actually were arrested and there were some accusations that the police the NYPD didn't do enough\nTo stop the attackers there was also an assumption that there was support here from the implicit support for the the the Proud Boys from the NYPD David do you think there's a level of support within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys\nYes I Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement system throughout the country right now as as being you know very heavily politicized by organizations like the oath keepers a which specifically you know this is\nEssentially a patriot very far right organization that is recruiting law enforcement uh and they're succeeding so yeah I've been out covering a lot of these and I would say Portland police in particular are very prone\nTo uh acting in defense of the the right wing side and I'm very much uh acting against the they very much see\nThe ah anti fascist says the bigger problem is and I think that's a problem Tanya your your thoughts\nOn what I find fascinating about this David is that I think another aspect of this is that even for the police officers who don't actually view themselves as being invested in this white supremacists authoritarianism\nI think are very much swayed by the idea that what they are serving our is just about free speech right that these folks are just spouting their ideas and I think that's part of the underlying problem here is the stereotype of the United states as being so absolute is about free speech\nThat you can say any kind of hateful thing on the street and it doesn't matter and it doesn't seem to me that it results in violence although history shows how intimately ... intertwined racist speech\nOn the street and it doesn't matter and it doesn't seem to me that it results in violence although history shows us how intimately ... intertwined racist speech is with racist violence\nI Do want to point out that we did reach out to the NYPD the takeaway did for comment about their response specifically to this incident and also\nThe claim that Gavin McGinnis said that he actually was supported by the NYPD so I'm going to read you a brief um a response from the NYPD and they say that they called me and it's an individual who's a provoke a tour who does not speak for the NYPD they say the NYPD is a diverse institution dedicated to keeping safe all eight point five million New Yorkers\nViolence and disorder like what occurred on October twelve is unacceptable and will not be tolerated and the the statement does go on so they did respond to this request\nAt the national level what do you see uh do you see this as a trend that is going to continue to catch on is this something that'll go back underground what's your experience tell you\nYeah my experiences doesn't really help [laughter] because because this was older I'm I'm obviously I think we all hope it goes back on the ground but are not very hopeful in that regard because I think this is very much a creature of the Internet\nDavid night where it is the author of all to

platform for years and how these posts for part of a coordinated campaign\nIt was a campaign meant to stoke already existing divisions in the country mostly against the real ... what we didn't know it was who exactly was behind it all we do now an investigation by the New York times is pointing to me and Mars own military\nReporter Paul Moser says the military was the main player behind the propaganda efforts on Facebook\nYou know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen there was kind of this exploratory effort and and you know there was maybe ten or twenty thirty people posted to do this but then as\nThe power of network became clear you know kind of from twenty fourteen on where the military start throwing a lot more resources um so in recent years you had hundreds of military officers\nAre on it and these people worked in shifts the open\nHe started throwing a lot more resources um so in recent years you had hundreds of military officers\nAre on it and these people worked in shifts they opened up thousands and thousands of troll accounts they would use them to attack\nPeople who attacked the military they would use them to get his view hate speech isn't even just just to provoke a adults and the comment so you know they would take both sides of the site start a site and then move away as other people joined in sort of squabbling and then they also had these really big fake accounts that they could use as propaganda outlets so ah you know\nPop star fan pages or beauty queen and ages or make sort of fake news pages they wouldn't use those to spread rumors and ... and one of the sort of most pernicious examples of this uh came last year on the anniversary of nine eleven\nBasically there were two messages going round one was spread some Muslim communities and said Buddhist we're going to attack them and the other was spread to Buddhist communities and said Muslims were going to wage jihad is attacks against them see so you have to take messages going out against\nThe two major groups basically spring fear and the entire country you know at least the main areas you ain't got in and Mandalay came to a standstill out of fear\nAnd what we found was that that was actually planted by the military and the idea was to create a kind of sense of insecurity and a feeling that there's the need to have the military to have that security\nSo when we talk about the Burmese military here uh taking on his campaign are we talking about extreme is kind of fringe elements within the military or doing an ad hoc kind of thing or was it really organize from a top them yeah no this is\nVery intentional in very well organized I mean there's three different groups in particular within the military that were responsible for this this was extremely intentional this was run the way you would run a military operation or campaign this was not some kind of you know group of people in a room that nobody else knew about this this was a sort of intentional saying that has been going on for a long time\nIt starts to sound a lot like the Kremlin's Internet research agency\nSaying that has been going on for a long time\nIt starts to

S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWell the reason that the Trump Administration was separated families was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely\nIf you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present and you kind of risks of society or viscous lead that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law\nAnd then right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border\nThe Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico and tons of it it's safe for them to wait there we also found that the U.S authorities had been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport those asylum seekers back to the very countries where they fled persecution or threats of death\nAnd that's flat illegal under both US law and international law\nSo they're these three interlocking policies and since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress have come to is asking for more information we're hopeful that as we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson brain griffey says Amnesty International was president of Murray's final immigration herring and it wasn't looking good for\nActually witness as the judge such compel her in the courtroom to give up her asylum claim in order to be reunited with her grandson with special needs before being deported back to Brazil the implication was all of a sudden I'm claims of merit less right so you're saying we want to close loopholes but we can\nNeeds before being deported back to Brazil the implication was all of a sudden I'm time some merit less right so he's saying we want to close the loop holes but we can reunite you what your grandson so you don't get deported without um so what you see here is a clear threat of permanently separating the grandmother from her grandson at the threat of being deported without him\nAnd what we saw in terms of both the grandmother and the grandson is it the long term consequences are great she actually had a medical emergency\nWhere she had to be rushed to the hospital because of health deteriorated so much from the mental anguish of being separated from her grandson was special needs and she presented this in court and still they prolonged her attention finally actually it was only when a congressperson bay so O'Rourke got involved that she was released an evil to to reunite with her grandson\nWhere our Maria and her grandson today\nThere in Connecticut he's still under state custody she was seeking to move from weekend visits to having guardianship over him again but she has to\nGo through the bureaucratic hoops while she also appeals for asylum claim I spoke with her a few weeks ago\nAnd she said you know I Need to go to a psychologist and the scars of deep I forget what I was saying I Can't sleep at night it was all the symptoms that I've identified when I've worked in war zones and but she told me you know that when she first saw him he wasn't being taken care of properly he was in this heavily air conditioned room just shivering saying you know a mommy mommy why did you leave me here\nAnd that every time they leave each other after a visit all day they both go through the suffering because they're reliving the moment to the separation\nWas emcee international Brian griffey
