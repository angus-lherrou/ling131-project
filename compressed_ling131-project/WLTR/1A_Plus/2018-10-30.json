from Cairo where he's the times bureau chief Declan thanks so much for taking the time my pleasure definitely remind us what Saudi Arabia contribution to the crisis ... what is their role\nWell the war in Yemen or other times starts at about four years ago when a group of grill is called the ... from northern Yemen seize control of the capital and then starts to move across the country seizing more territory and\nThis ... this come to the Saudis who six months later in March twenty Fifteen starts to air strikes a campaign of air strikes in Yemen\nAnd effectively setting the war in motion as it stands\nNow in order to find out who these empower the Saudis see who these as proxies for Iran because these are she is or they practice a form of ... and because they have received some weapons supplies from the Iranians the Saudis have been fighting the war principally\nBy air for the last three years they've carried out almost twenty thousand airstrikes against\nCruelty and also economic target in the country and that has brought a great deal of criticism of Saudis because\nHousing of civilians have died and those airstrikes and and they have brought recently accusations of war crimes on the part of the United nations against the Saudi led coalition the other part of the Saudi led campaign to oust duties as being a range of\nPunitive economic measures that the Saudis have imposed on territory that is controlled by the booth these in an effort to uh\nIt offensively in an effort to isolate them but we just had the effect of really falling very heavily on the country's civilian population because those same measures actively contributions to crushing the economy and that's what we've seen in the last couple of months the collapse of the country of Yemen already berries\nPractically contribution to crushing the economy and that's what we've seen in the last couple of months the collapse of the country of Yemen already very fragile economy\nYour reporting on in the New York times was accompanied by some pretty devastating photos taken by Tyler Hicks I'm kind of get the New York times of young get many children on the brink of death by starvation can you give us a sense of how and why that decision was made to include does sodas in the reporting\nWell those are certainly some of the most shocking pulled it I think the times has used in recent years and the decision to use them was not taken lightly and our photos have said often is now we tend to err on the side of caution in publishing very graphic pictures but there were a couple of very compelling reasons as\nTo to publish these pictures and the instance one I think was that these photographs constitute a very shocking reminder of the fact that the common has no ... on\nA different consciousness there's an idea Simon is something\nThat happened in the Nineteen eighties in Ethiopia or perhaps a\nIn places like Somalia in two thousand and eleven and these are really are a minder that in in this day and age a a very severe starvation is reality and Yemen and the second factor which I think was probably the most compelling one is that this is very much ... this is not a potential you make of\nThis is not a humanitarian catastrophe that as a result of a natural disaster or of a naturally occurring shortage of food in these areas\nOn the country when we were travelling through Yemen and in many of the towns we visited the stores full of food the problem is that nobody are very few people can afford to buy it because of the country's economy has devastated and the economic devastation is a direct product of the way that the war has been waged\nLargely by south side of you'd I'd coalition\nStates and the economic devastation is a direct product of the way that the war has been waged largely by Saudi Saudi led coalition some of the decision they have taken like withholding opportunities from a million civil servants in government controlled and\nWho'd be controlled areas had an absolutely devastating effect on the local economy as well as the plunge into the value of Yemeni currency at\nThose kind of decisions have meant that people have far less money than before and the money they have is worth for all of that and for people who are already living on the brink this has nothing to push them over the edge\nAnd I wish that I think we're talking to Declan Walsh at the New York times and he's joining us from Skype in Cairo Declan what is the international community's response to this and what is has it been so far it has it been sufficient because to say that there is food and yet there's this famine happening it just seems devastatingly cruel\nWell over the last uh over the summer the international community response has focused largely on the effort by the Saudi led coalition to capture a port call today to us the gateway for about three quarters of international humanitarian aid the entrance Yemen so a lot of concern\nHas focused on ensuring I'm pressuring the competence that the fighting should not reached support 'em stop the supply reaching the country but increasingly now because of the nature of this bomb or the\nThreatened bombing and the problem with the cost of the economy a lot of stress now is I'm trying to pressure the parties to impose measures that would allow the economy to repair it somehow and give him and he's a chance to buy the food that they need to stave off starvation\nDeclan Walsh of the New York times bureau chief in Cairo and there's a link to his reporting on Yemen at the takeaway

four hurricane Ivan bowled over an oil rig belonging to tailor energy setting off a massive oil spill on the coast of Louisiana that's been growing steadily for fourteen years\nEvery day the site assistance viewing between three hundred seven hundred barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico Taylor Energy has cleaned up some of the mass but they've also been suing the government to avoid a full cleanup of the site and if the spill is not stop soon it's on track to become one of the worst in us history\nMichael ... is a reporter with the Associated Press and he's been reporting on the Taylor oil spill for years Michael thanks for joining us for our membership to this spill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years\nWhat did they find well they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which were put together by independent researcher from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily\nFrom multiple wells around that platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan and two thousand and four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years is that Taylor Energy company based in New Orleans that doesn't have any assets anymore is essentially only exist to fight this bill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end this leak they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started here down below the surface of the Gulf\nObviously there's a money issue here but what is it about this film that why is it taking so long for this to stop this is I think it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard\nWell hadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that ... that's true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that though while I mean that's I think that's open to debate certainly and um ah the government's position is very different that that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do it they can the problem is\nIs that when that hurricane roll through and knocked over\nThe uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of sediment that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life that's the company and with the company says no company did kill some of the wealth they said but\nThey said that nothing more can be done without causing potentially greater risk if they go in there and they\nTake the settlement away could make leak even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like\nGreater risk if they go in there and they take the sediment away could make leak even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government and the company about what needs to be done next but the government believes that something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else down there below the surface\nI'm just wondering the Taylor oil spill is back in the news but its rivaling this BP oil spill in twenty can I Can't forget the images of the BP oil spill they were like on loop and I'm Wondering how this is affecting the environment differently than the BP oil spill into Wilton\n... tend to be ... as we all remember we were kind of transfixed by the images of this billowing wave of crude oil coming out of the bottom of the sea floor if it was coming out all at once you know over the period of grad\nI Believe three months or so but that massive amount of oil came out all once and that as you know and it ... birds on the seashore and it created an environmental catastrophe and in this case this has been a slow motion environmental problem with a tailor energy it's it's seeped out slowly and\nI'm not a scientist but I've been told that the damage and the effect is far less serious when it's staggered out and the oil can be weathered\nBy waves and water and it doesn't have quite the same impact also the company has said that there is no evidence\nThat this oil from the ... is reaching shores about twelve miles off the coast of Louisiana and these slicks stretch for miles every day or almost every day\nBut don't flex also have an impact on the environment whether we can feed them or not I mean who's supposed to make sure that this is an environmentally sound place\nI Believe that there are some a disagreement about this between the two sides of the company has its own experts who say that there is no environmental ecological risk or danger or damage and then the government says differently that there's at least the potential for damage to the ecology out there even if it's not oil and birds on the shore and you know there's fish there's other marine life out there\nCertainly that there's at least the potential for damage to the ecology out there even if it's not oil and birds on the shore you know there's ... there's other marine life out there that could be affected by these persistent and chronic leaks\nSo we know the Taylor Energy is suing the federal government what else are they doing we understand that one of the former owners we do is a prominent philanthropist in Louisiana\nYeah so the Taylor name or his best known probably in Louisiana for a program called tops the tea and tops which has financed free college tuition for many families over the years the this is a couple\nOf their own said vested a lot of money in um helping other people millions of dollars in flat or be work is Taylor his widow is also a very influential political figure donor too many congressmen and senators and she had hired\nLawyers to lobby on Capitol Hill to try to get the company a break so it's still a lot of fights it's ongoing both in court and also a separately the company I tried to petition the somewhat obscure a government agency\nTo give it a relief from this a long standing orders that it had to do more down below the sea floor in terms of drilling a intervention well to try to kill underground well so there's two fronts but primarily it's just become case about money\nAnd about how much more than you to spend or have available to spend down below the surface [noise]\nMake all kinds of minutes a reporter with the Associated Press Michael thanks for joining us\nGiving scientists working around the Gulf about the oil spill bird and ask for marine geologist at the University of southern Missouri told us that he thinks Taylor Energy should not have to clean up the sites that they should fund scientific research that he really\nCared about twenty oil blowout and federal and state waters every year professor ... says scientists used to Taylor\nFun scientific research to study the leaks there about twenty oil blowout and federal and state waters every year professor at first that scientists can use the Taylor oil spill to examine the impact of the oil how the sea floor community response to it how it interacts with plankton and how oil is transported from the surface floor\nProfessor asked for also that some scientists have requested intentional releases of oil basically creating a spill in the Gulf to study these effect\nThe Taylor

over the past few years at Facebook's communities have some problems hate speech disinformation fake news\nThese problems don't just live on line this spill into the real world and they have serious consequences or ... good frontline here a W GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world\nThey're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week we want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nGave it a name patriotic trolling online seat sponsoring that is meant to silence meant to intimidate says this information ecosystem that just turns of democracy and we're\nAllies are prevalent [noise]\nSo this information just change democracy and we're allies are prevalent [noise]\nFront lines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming by James thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much do they interact with each other by the up\nWhile it's remarkable the story Facebook and southeast Asia's amazing that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of their digital lives\nSo Maria right so we just heard from we'll hear more from her in a moment um we've reported on the story that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen so what\nHappened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to to tear today during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports\nAfter he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had a network of faith\nIs it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling\nHe had a network of fake accounts and paid followers that we're descending all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\n[noise] so uh on Maria ... uh the the activist and she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between you James and ... so\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting\nFacebook lung damage to the Philippines and they were focused on ... but they didn't realize is that\nCountries like the [noise] countries way institutions are clear corruption is France [laughter] they don't have the safeguards\nWhen you bring everyone onto a platform and do not exercise any kind of rules\nIf you don't implement those Will Smith for\nYour point in the chaos so\nJames what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts but as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly recently\nSpeech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts\nBut as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly recently in as a as I think it was an April Facebook is paying Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there\nDoes that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole\nI think that that there are fact checking project that they are trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country on in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinated about it is that\nWhere your rent Reza runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question would you rate several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's this information\nFake news hate speech or what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at the age cue for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what the standard for success here because there is no ability for us to audit them were really left in this position of having to take their word for it\nAnd whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that would just\nTo audit them were really left in this position of having to take their word for it and whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know\nBut as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your dog and it's really was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know that the horrific events here of the past week\nAnd scenes that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media polarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and that's kind of reinforcement of world views\nThat's the main discussion happening right\nNow I think James after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know often\nI I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what data they're collecting around you um but uh it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who is in the film was a scholar at UNC um says I think one of the most important lines which is\nWhat are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention budget is so problematic so ... what are you gonna do\nJames Jacoby with frontline part two of the Facebook to limit airs tonight on PBS and you can find part one on line at P. B. S. dot org James thanks very much for coming back you\nKnow the gene leading them\nPart one on line at P. B. S. dot org James thanks very much for coming in that camp\nFood he's joining the favor\nYeah I mean not totally but it also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the U.S a ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nOne of the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and those answer the anti Semite so usually not me not being on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it comes from the rights or whether it's home [laughter]\nMe or not being on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it comes from the right or whether it's on similar yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews would be no firm hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic these important Toyotas really due to the Trump support Israel to Trump's support the strong Israel so I'm ... comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDidn't tell me a bit about reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nOver all although there has been expressions of condolence expressions of shocking to hire the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact\nThat this had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up in Hebrew school\nOr they hide as I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play and kind of come of age\nAnd that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I Want to share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm One of the stories that move me most was a story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that is when he was shot and and after the memorial in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this\nInteresting custom dream order Scottish which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the cash and that is traditionally a time and only those were\n... the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up to the ... and that is traditionally a time and only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day\nThere will be nobody's to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing up and that standing up together is such a metaphor and I think overall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\n... the president does reveal across the differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\n[noise] me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews are two very different paths right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant would just\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to knowledge that you know American Jews have done fairly well to themselves in in America\nI'm and feel fairly successful and feel very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens them to sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still feel under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product of sort of post traumatic post Holocaust world or they look at things very much and it sort of zero sum game at times you know us versus them whether it comes to ...\nHost Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much and it sort of zero sum game it times you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm threats from within somehow an Israeli the trend towards that it's like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think you should just divisions coming more clearly now and for\nA task tragically in some ways highlights those splintered\n[noise] reporter Dina cropped with Haaretz in Tel Aviv she's also the host of the podcast the branch Dina thanks very much for your time thank you\n... ... ... ...\n... ...\nAnd her life roof gates earned a reputation as a passionate defender of coral reefs [noise] when\nYou look at organisms and um you look at a coral reef clearly we're losing more corals that we would hope and that means the rates of changing the environments have essentially out pace the capacity of the calls themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was says gates was one of the very first scientists to make the connection between coral bleaching and global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days when none of us understood what was going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pay lanes and she was able to tie it to warming and\nAt that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until death gates led a research lab at the University of\nGates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her ... a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adopt to warming oceans friend Virginia was says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI Will remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking just to them she\nHad this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an iconic closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of corals very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate\nThe heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly shoes and iconoclast in terms of the way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues decided to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation\nAnd encouraging all diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world of coral science\nA more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help his coral reefs\nMake the world a coral science a more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help these coral reefs are in the face of in the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events\nAnd the rest of the news isn't good I mean coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades and yet Rick Gates remained so optimistic how did she retain that optimism all studying something so depressing\nWell it's such a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life\nShe just looked forward and she felt like you know we can try our hands up and give up or we can look for solutions and I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates\nLaugh\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that failed around people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean and she laughs she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State university and a longtime friend and colleague of coral researcher Ruth Gates who died last week Virginia thanks for telling about Ruth and our condolences to you thank you so much Marco\nMm\nMm\nMm\n\n\nMm\nThis is
