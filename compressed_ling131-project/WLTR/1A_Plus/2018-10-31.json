to lift fellow Republicans in tight races in an effort to maintain control of Congress in order to keep his base energize the president is keeping his messaging simple\nTo violate our laws or grosser borders illegally will be sent back home court\n[noise]\nAnd we tell them not deserve got along hike but they get they cannot government\nThe way they want a government doesn't work that way\nWith less than a week to go will the president's message motivate his core supporters to turn out like they did in twenty sixteen here to discuss this Christopher catalogue all the White House reporter for political Christopher welcome to the take away\nIt's a pleasure to be here [noise] so let's talk about the president's messaging here as we said we've got one week before the midterm elections what are some of the big themes that the president is really knocking hard we've got obviously immigration what else are you seeing\nThe president is going very hard on illegal immigration as you mentioned he has brought up a very unlikely proposal but one that he thinks it's going to motivate folks which was a ten percent tax cut on the middle class\nThe president has continued his barrage of assaults on the media\nAnd in the last few days he has really dialed up his critique of the Democratic party that is meant as something to really unified Republicans pointing to what he sees as kind of the extremes of the Democratic party\nYou know and I'm Wondering the president has made no secret of his thoughts on migrants coming from Central America for Mexico with the very beginning of his campaign so is there a reason why he still really doubling down on immigration\nCentral America for Mexico the very beginning of his campaign so is there a reason why he still really doubling down on immigration um what is that strategy tell us as opposed to health care or as opposed to other issues that he should be looking at\nThis is a an election that's really based\nOn motivating his base nationalizing the selection around his supporters because the question that Republicans have always had as there were a number of people who turned out for Donald Trump much of them Republicans but not all of them and the question was would they come out and turn out for\nA member of Congress or a candidate for the house\nAnd that has been a much tougher thing to answer and so\nIf Donald Trump goes out there and says this midterms is really about me my policies are on the ballot you'll remember rock Obama said that and it turned into a scandal will Donald Trump has been saying that exact thing and it's it's a way for him to ah to make this about himself in a way to really sort of rile up his supporters\nAre what I Would say about illegal immigration that he's focused on is this has been a constant focus as you pointed out I mean\nGoing back to the beginning of his campaign obviously earlier this spring he went really hard on the MS Thirteen gang and started using terms like animals to describe people which are generated a lot of backlash and so what he's doing is we we flash forward to the beginning of October\nAnd the president's political team started to get a whole bunch of polling data come back to them about this issue of immigration\nSaying that in a lot of these marginal districts these competitive house districts where Donald Trump is not always seen as a help\nIllegal immigration was resonating with folks this whole idea of the Republican Party being sort of the protectors\nWas resonating with folks this whole idea of the Republican Party being sort of the protectors of immigration and customs agents there was an abolish ice movement on the left obviously and so that whole issue was resonating and what happened was the the president sort of\nHad this migrant caravan issues sort of land in his lap after they had already decided that they were going to really close on illegal immigration\nWell and and there's also the the recent news that the president has decided to send troops to the southern border we should also remind our listeners that\nThis migrant caravan if you will the folks who are migrating are still weeks away from even reaching the United states border so the president's doubling down on sending troops and reinforces the idea that these folks are almost the scapegoats in many ways right\nYeah I mean a lot of these attacks a lot of these statements are not grounded in reality as you mentioned these people are hundreds of miles away they would not reach here like you said for weeks and then in the last day or so there's been this issue of ending birthright citizenship which um is has been\nReally sort of the third rail um and and it has come up and it has worked in the president's favorite was obviously a question from a reporter it was not something the White House proactively put out\nThere well let's listen to that 'cause I I Want to hear that clip and then I Want us to sort of break that down\nImmigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution we could have water exactly uh have you thought about that is totally all it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of and\nYou don't you to number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing to human emotions well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress\nNumber one number one you don't need that nobody can actually human emotions well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nI think the president was very frustrated in the folks around him were very frustrated over the last few days because the the narrative or as folks go head to the polls and a lot of these states that have early voting\nA was all about domestic terrorism there was this obviously this is terrible a shooting in Pittsburgh and and ... you know\nEverybody sees these these things as the tragedies that they are but we have to say that what Republicans have been saying all along they knew this was going to be a very tough mid term elections Donald Trump knew that as well\nAnd what they were saying was you know all these issues come up and they they last for a day or two and then they dissipate and so they never really knew where we would end what would we be talking about when voters finally start going to the polls\nAnd they were talking about these these domestic terrorism issues that we're not seen as a help to the party so the president saw the the migrant caravan despite the fact that it was never going to reach\nA the border anywhere near election day as a political gift that was the term that the folks around him were using and then I Would say the same thing for this question that came up yesterday I mean these are things that are going to come up and what he's doing even if it's not something that they're generating they're able to amplify these stories and to really give them life and I think that\nIf that is something that allows them to turn the page on the type of narratives that they don't find helpful they are going to do that\nChristopher ... is a White House reporter for political Christopher thanks again thank you so much [noise]\nFor the ... comes from babble European language learning program\nFederal teachers

we're going to do it some time in the future we need to be doing this and the next thirty days we've admired this problem for long enough down there\nThe United states has long been criticized for aiding the Saudis and the war by most estimates well over two million Yemen nice have been displaced and the humanitarian crisis is of a scale that's hard to fathom\nEven having been there several times before I was shocked at how bad it had become\nNew York times staff photographer Tyler Hicks has made three trips to the war torn country his latest just this month and what he found there was unlike anything he'd seen before\nOn Tuesdays program we talk to the New York times is Declan Walsh who's recent reporting shares vivid details of the desperate state of millions of civilians in Yemen a country now at the brink of famine\nAccompanying that report were portraits captured by Tyler Hicks showing children and babies starving to death in the north of the country and the bloody conflict ongoing in the south I spoke to Tyler today about those photographs\nYemen's very difficult place to work there are a lot of distance\nIn the south I spoke to Tyler today about those photographs\nYemen's of very difficult place to work there are a lot of\nDistance to cover you know lots of checkpoints but there were a few places that we'd heard that people are really suffering and and these are areas where people\nAre coming from a pretty large region and and getting to just a couple of really clinics I mean these are so much hospitals as as we would think of them back home these are very small\nClinics where where people come and however they can we found out there a lot of the problems is just that the economy of there's absolutely\nNo money they earned by people people don't have jobs they don't have money to get to these hospitals fuels very expensive and hard to come by and make it costs a lot of money for them you know they're they're they're having a hard time just\nFeeding their families are let alone going many hours in a vehicle to get to a clinic\nThat's how we chose to go to these specific areas\nNow the piece that you did for the New York times one of the first images that readers will see\nWhen they open the peace is a photo of a young girl named among all can you describe the photo for our listeners and tell us a little bit about what you were seeing and experiencing and really what struck you about a mile [laughter]\nI've been to a few hospitals clinics around the north and then when I when I walked into this particular one in a place called ...\nI can tell that the moment that I walked and that this was a really were some of the worst cases were a it's a kind of open court orders with rooms a surrounding it and just looking from that central area without even entering the rooms I could see that that the children there\nWere were really in terrible shape skin and bones\nFrom that central area without even entering the rooms I could see that that the children there were were really in terrible shape skin and bones and the first for him that I went into I saw this young girl a mall and\nThe poor child was just laying on on um Koch her ribs just showing completely through her skin there is an ounce of of fat on her her arms and legs just like to fix\nIt was just very you know something about her face also she's very calm child who ... when you see your body is just heartbreaking and and I I spent a lot of time photographing her um I I knew that\nAs difficult as this photograph was to take\nAnd as difficult it is for the the viewers just to see\nI knew that this was going to be an important picture and an important photograph to be seen because uh she she really sums up how tragic and how bad the the malnutrition and the starvation has really become in Yemen\nAnd Tyler ... there is often a debate about traumatic images right on the one hand people will say they're just too traumatic to publish tend to look at um on on the other hand there people who say are they exploiting you know people who are in their most vulnerable state\nAnd as a photo journalist I'm Wondering how do you grapple with those issues\nI never take photographs that are difficult to look at just for the sake of of getting a traumatic photo or sometimes there's a reason to document things that can be difficult to look at and and this was one of those cases\nThere's a lot of decision that goes into both taking the photographs than to file the photographs to the New York times and then there's a whole team of ...\nBoth taking the photographs than to file the photographs to the New York times and then there's a whole team of people there who decide\nWhether that image or images will appear in the newspaper\nThis is one of the cases where I think it's really important for these photographs to be seen I mean there has not been\nA lot of coverage out of Yemen it's it's a very difficult place to get to because the travel restrictions they're western journalists have not been invited very often do to go there so when we can see what's happening that's an opportunity for us to to show what's what's happening in the country is as difficult as it is\nAnd Tyler have we become desensitized to images like this and the crisis in Yemen over all\nUm because I just think back to what two years ago when there was an image of a toddler or that the Syrian refugee crisis in this town there you know was dead on the beach on the shore and I just think that image was so powerful like are we becoming desensitized to the horrors out there\nBecause we are just there's so much going on right now\nI think yes but at the same time it that doesn't affect the way I think that\nI should be doing my job or about how the media should be covering these places you catch tried to deconstruct what people sensitivities are\nAnd in effect claim chain what you what you choose to show I think it's the more people become used to these things actually the more that you should be out there covering them because people need to be reminded of what's happening out there but all that being said it's it's extremely important to keep the temple up\nAnd to continue to get these images out there\nAnd had them scene and to get a reaction from them and of course some people will disagree with that they'll think\nTo continue to get these images out there\nAnd had them scene and to get a reaction from them and of course some people will disagree with that they'll think that these photographs shouldn't be shown wonder why would you show you know these these children who are are starving to death I mean that there was another photographs that ran as part of that I was at the same hospital\nAnd done as people were praying in there they're sick children often with their mothers being completely malnourished and unable to breastfeed or to to give any nutrition for them\nAnd it was a child photographs and um eight hours later that that that child died I found out the next day and uh\nThat's just incredibly heartbreaking to be witness to such a young an innocent life that then it was just gone you know you hear it the next day though that that child died and the people who are volunteering and working in these clinics are they're kind of becoming used to it\nTyler Hicks is a staff photographer for the New York

in the United states and to really hope that the United states or will not\nGo down that way the imperial Germany went down being over the country then over its capacities and ah being overly enthusiastic about it drove him to build\nOr in a pot salt political scientist at the Technical University of dressing thank you very much was talking to you\nYou're attuned to the world\nGardeners I'm American but don't you have an extension and making it through\nThe red maples that drive and the floodplains of the country and what are we rivers are actually more striking in January and

under certain environmental conditions [noise]\nFunded by South Carolina Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau insurance\nMarket ... and this is the world thanks to the Trump effect there's a lot of interests around the globe and our mid term elections next week enough to send an Australian political strategist halfway across the planet\nBruce hawk or is his name for the past month he's been traveling around the U.S speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said and mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division\nStruck by the amount of division in America or may not been traveling Houston's not in Ninety six to observe presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that everybody here and there is in their respective camping\nIt's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one camp or the other end have very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who are on either side I think there's this sense of disconnect and it upsets people\nIt's the same story everywhere we go on happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what what you see and it's a disc quiet I think which is ... ... American society right now even the people who are very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see them\nThis quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even the people who are very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's a hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been extremely I may pay\nTrump's support as as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and then they'll site North Korea is an example of that the tariff wars with China and the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals\nThat people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we were just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conduct a little focus group that primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though ... not buying their crops the down by about twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then would speak to other ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon begin to have another hobby snakes you may not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to a coal was kept out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride but usually motivates what people's biting intentions are going to be ... have you ever seen it done\nWhy the hip pocket and the as we call it in stride and but you usually ... people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in a strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and\nIt usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind and I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had a woman called polling Hansen she still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and ... but people in tourists dependent electric was voting for her and sorry yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once and it said was ... votes of Thanksgiving sometimes that it just happens to\nThe question now I think that we're gonna have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance to see how you guys and that may mean that the cycle blue light that's coming might just be more of a trickle\n[noise] how much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region\nWell it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue\nAnd people of color they were very very distressed that I felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen\nChina had refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view coming from a president does somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary [noise] Bruce you've been to the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWilling to strike have compulsory ... at stake and that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fined if we die hard but a science take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd then of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa rather than having to energize the base all the time\nIf you're ... you're a politician and astray you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that I'm the pain the major political parties for example\nAh you know we have a national hills scale which would never be touched by either of the major parties on anything to model lifetime it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to the pot from that that would be the end of the prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMore motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from journalists and others that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and and the ...\nAnd all those that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides with seeing this remarkable energizing I'd be very surprised if we can say ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of suppression\nThat that has had to resist effect and that there has been a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there and one of the things that have been doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump in the priorities that he has and they basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational dead\nBut they really do worry about climate and climate change and you can understand why you know I wouldn't be around to see the worst effects of climate change but they will and I think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBruce Walker is an Australian political strategists he's been filming a documentary called a hard road travels and Trump's America we'll speak with them again after the midterms\nBy the way if you're a new U.S citizen are voting for the first time here in America we want to hear from you what does voting mean to you and how does it compare with voting in another country\nEmail us at this address my world at the world dot org again that's my world at the world dot O. R. G.\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as leader because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to massage all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when that war began\nIs that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success some policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where do the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nYour tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point an new story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins of the idea that we're going to be decisive foot river really defending what we ought to do is put and drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala a lack of opera\nThe United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala [noise]\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nSo I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue 'cause the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those\nAnd it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid off from me what is your take on the on the time being set by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expanded beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's they ... to the rhetoric now\nAnd this gets back to what we talked about earlier and values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror and we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders\nBecause I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be when I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says well I Need to be a little more patient I Need to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate I expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWell I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm I'm adolescent you does he reflect your values general I think\nAmerican values well I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question I'm I'm Out when you dizzy reflect your values general I think I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to\nBut I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other [noise]\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal his new book is leaders myth and reality thank you very much for being with us you know it's my pleasure\nBoat okay
