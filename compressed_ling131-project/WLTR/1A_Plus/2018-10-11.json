week we've been talking with reporters at the center for Public Integrity about their series\nThis has to take away the tansy Nevada\nAll this week we've been talking with reporters at the center for Public Integrity about their series abandoned in America which explores cities and towns across the country where poverty is inescapable\nIn St Louis Missouri a major component of the crisis it's affordable housing there just isn't enough of it and for many of the residents who do manage to get a subsidized place to live conditions only adds to the indignity of living and working in poverty\nWas a mole inside the park and do what they did was getting rid of the mole they just had a big fan so after about a month or two episodes coming through you know\nThe feelings you know in my basement\nI had gone through oh my gosh you have no idea what I'm\nThat's January Harris a mother and receptionist in St Louis January went from living in an apartment run by the St Louis housing authority to a townhouse run by a private landlord one that she paid for with help from a federal section ... voucher program but even though she works full time January says the assistant she's getting is not enough\nAnybody that is on section eight or or other colleagues or some type\nThey need it nobody is using that if they don't they're low income families you know again they may be disabled they may not work and so people were\nThree part time job is not in in his you know still is not a\nThere's a big discrepancy in St Louis and economy that President Trump likes to boast is stronger than ever and the stagnant under class of people trapped in poverty and challenged every month to keep a roof over their heads\nThat's with a piece of beach I'm a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity found in her reporting in St Louis especially in the city about twenty six point seven percent of the people\nThere are living below the federal poverty level it's very difficult if you are very low or extremely low\nThat of the people there are living below the federal poverty level it's very difficult if you are very low or extremely low income to find affordable housing and especially if you need assistance the\nLast time the city opened its housing choice voucher commonly known as section eight was in twenty fourteen so when you have is people waiting years hoping that they'll be able to receive a voucher a for housing that will accommodate them and their children\nI'm there also are waiting lists of for a public housing in the city and the county as well\nNow what are your options if you are waiting for a section ... voucher we're what do you do in the meantime\nIt's not really a pretty picture people are either and unstable conditions there living with family members so might even be facing homelessness or they're living in sub par a housing conditions as they wait for years to find housing\nI'm curious if you can help us understand how the section eight voucher program works and um I Know it's a complicated program there are many different kinds but what what is it generally do\nYes so with the U.S section eight housing choice voucher system it allows for a person to seek housing through a privately owned property um and\nThe federal government will pay a subsidy to the section eight accepting landlord and the tenant will pay the difference uh based on there and\nTell us about January Harris January Harris\nI'm lives out in Ferguson, Missouri she lives in the county of St Louis within a week of her moving into her town home for her and her youngest daughter Michael Brown was killed by police officer in that housing complex is just\nA two minute drive away and she has worked for most of her time as an adult dumb\nIn that housing complex it's just\nA two minute drive away and she has worked for most of her time as an adult down at least I went back to her work history back to two thousand\nAnd so she is technically checking off the personal responsibility boxes that\nPresident Trump and Ben Carson has said are ways to get out of the system but at the end of the day it's just not enough she does make money she does technically an above the state's minimum wage job seven eighty five\nBut even with that it's it's hard for her to make ends meet because as soon as she got her job\nAt um a local nonprofit in St Louis before she got her first paycheck her rent had increased\nSo I get paid by the end what am I completely for the rest of the world are not receiving any child\nI work every day for it goes all their trees\nI mean they they made a problem like this is supposed to be stepping stone associate family to transition to where they do not only say that this is and there's no way to get off I was literally probably\nShe's essentially not able even with her current employment able to even get off of section ... housing right now because money is just too tight is the housing situation\nThat you're describing a where there's limited housing available and long wait times for\nSection ... vouchers is that being exacerbated by gentrification\nAt all\nIt comes to public housing and section eight housing I'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my sense a through my reporting it\nI'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my sense a through my reporting is that the housing authorities are\nWander highly underfunded um and that is not a partisan or something unique to this administration\nInto it can be difficult to find landlords who want to accept a section eight housing choice voucher holders because of all the stigma that come with that really that's racism or whether that's your fear that they may not care for the property and also for the landlords are\nThere is a long process of paperwork and inspections that goes into whether or not you choose to be a section eight landlords so I think it's a lot of bureaucracy at play the reason why it's so hard to find affordable housing\nWell let's also talk about um what the current administration's stance is when it comes to public housing I'm thinking specifically about Ben Carson\nA HUD secretary who are essentially on did a twenty Fifteen rule that require communities that receive HUD funding make an effort to integrate their neighborhoods where does that steps\nIn the Nineteen fifties in the Nineteen sixties there was a wave of white flight to the suburbs\nAnd what you have now is a county that is mostly white and in the city it's pretty much predominantly black\nSo there is concerned there will be more division because of the undoing of this rule because it's no longer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your communities\nThe president has said that the war on poverty is largely over a does that reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually um when I was visiting various communities especially\nOver a does that reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually um when I was visiting various communities especially along north side\nPeople

office\nKimberly thanks for joining us and as a pleasure to be here what an interesting topic this is um let's talk a little bit about motivation right well I mean we were hearing was the year if the woman and everybody wants to run for office but there's one is particularly driving women of color more specifically black women to run for office well I think it is\nUm you know this confluence of events that we are that we find ourselves in a black woman had been running and doing the work behind the scenes for generations you know thinking back to like Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan you know women have been a black woman had been in the trenches\nAnd now there is this new sense of urgency we're seeing the attempts and in many cases the actual reality of the roll back to the last fifty years of progress\nAnd we're seeing that you know black women are saying I Can't let this happen to my community so I'm going to step up and run and it is um that combined with\nUh the electorate realizing that you know over eighty percent of our elected officials across the country are white and male and that is you know by no means represents the diversity in this nation the electorate is saying you know we need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd these black women are speaking to my issues uh regardless of you know the fact that they're black\nWe need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd these black women are speaking to my issues\nUh regardless of you know the fact that they're black or they can appeal to everybody and it has really been a great\nUm catalyst for all of these women to run such strong primaries and you know we're really looking forward to some great pickups on November sex so let's talk a little bit about that because there are some challenges specifically\nIt and we know politics is is like any other industry right there are challenges as we mentioned to funding and and getting support here\nUm yesterday and the show we talked about how important black women are to the Democratic party they've been called the backbone of the Democratic party Ninety some odd percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and yet they still lacking representation and the party's leadership one of the guests that we had raised this notion of viability of black women candidates\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think black women candidates are thought of by the Democratic party as less viable because of who they are because they can't raise the money because they won't give them to support what is that about\nUm I think that's exactly it ice higher heights who was born out of the notion that\nWe needed a space for black women a political home for black women and go into a car and I we knew from our experience that the factors that make a black woman a viable candidate or not necessarily the same as our white counterparts\nAnd we know that by mobilizing our networks because that is what we do just you know to make life happen for so many of us\nAnd the volunteer effort and the word of mouth and then also be bringing our authentic selves ah to the campaign trail has really been\nA a great factor in the successes so we've always looked at Kennedy to a walk in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm on bought and on boss we look at what kind of a volunteer structure\nSo at Kennedy to a walk in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm on bought and on boss we look at what kind of a volunteer structure they have\nWe look at a you know do they have enough money to reach their constituents we don't need you know the hundreds of millions of dollars that so many of these races costs but do you have the baseline of what it's going to take for you to reach your target voters and do you have a solid campaign plan\nAnd you know are you in line with issues that we believe will make sure that black women in their communities and their families thrive\nWe should also note that Nineteen of the black women who are running for the house are challenging incumbents here now that could work to their favor or not depending on what we talked about which is funding you know how often is the ability to raise money part of the viability of a candidate right because you mentioned you don't need hundreds and millions and millions of dollars but\nAre there specific barriers to fund raising that black women candidates face in particular\nYou well I think there is you know just unfortunately the um institutional wealth\nOr we haven't been here that long we've had a challenges to our communities that have not allowed us to amass\nA the the type of wealth that some of our counterparts have uh the fact that black women are making sixty three cents on the dollar just you know from the jump you know we we need our whole dollar if we're going to be competitive but I think it is also thinking through it's not just the the large checks but\nAh being able to mobilize our networks for those you know monthly five dollar contributions that add up over time\nAnd see those ah you know contributions as a strength because they're not just dollars but they're also voters and most likely volunteers and it's also a question of actually getting people to the polls I mean you can spend all the money you want and I think we saw that here in New York will out of what I like the end you Ocasio Cortez who

[laughter]\nYou know cases though where American companies who had a things stolen from them in ... you know technology and and secret and have they ever been able to litigate the cases\nAs a matter of fact they have and uh the situation is really improving in China you go back Twenty years and the Chinese didn't have much in terms of\nA legislation for protecting intellectual property but over this period the legislation has improved quite markedly\nEnforcement has remained a challenge but even enforcement is improving\nThe big exception is in trade secrets for our companies that remains probably the biggest area of ... intellectual property that is difficult to protect why because there\nIsn't a proper legislation on this and uh I Know that the Chinese are working on it and the U.S

doing these things but we have been more or less complicit because we really didn't apply pressure until very recently\nWilliam Zarit is chairman of the nonprofit American Chamber of commerce in China
