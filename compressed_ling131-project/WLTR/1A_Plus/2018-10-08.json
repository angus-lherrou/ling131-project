work requirements for public assistance at the same time unemployment is at three point seven percent and the stock market is booming\nSo is the war on poverty really one well this week we're working with the center for Public Integrity to check in on parts of the country that are still struggling with poverty our first stop today ... Texas the small poor border town depends on its relationship with Mexico just steps away across the Rio Grande\nThe town would also be directly impacted by the president's proposed border wall\nYou know there's a lot of killing\nSure there are some places that have that\nI mean living here it's quiet as\nLow as they say they love and all is here to tell us all about this he's the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway going to be with your ... so what is ... Texas like ...\nOf your Texas is sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nAnd our reporters who hunter Hussein who spent some time this summer down there found a place that really cut against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that ... ...\nThe federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway got to be with your tempting so what is ... Texas like\n... you know Texas is sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nIn a reporters who hunter Hussein who's spent some time this summer down there found a place that really cut against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on its cross border sister town in Mexico in August ... Mexico and as a result quite literally people depend on the Naga for\nThe basics of life groceries water a transportation family there is such a cultural connection almost a symbiosis there that were a border wall to be built um most of the people there feel as if the community would be\nNot only cut off but even killed by its own country and they feel that the debate in Washington is a world away from the reality that they're living down there a ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty a not a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel\nGo well beyond a border wall they don't want the wall at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going to quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty is largely over what is the main concern for folks and ... if it's not immigration if it's not the wall is poverty or is it something else\n[noise] poverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health on a very odd twist it in the story is that if you have a a an injury if you're very sick and you need to get medical care there's only the most rudimentary basic medical care available and not I\nPoverty area I'm going to quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty is largely over what is the main concern for folks and ... if it's not immigration if it's not the wall is poverty or is it something else [noise]\nPoverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health on a very odd twist to in the story is that if you have a a an injury if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere is only the most rudimentary basic medical care available and not in ... and you have to rely on\nThe hospitals and not go out to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be a matter of fact two at Texas a city that are in minimum will be an hour away and if you really need serious care can be four hours away by car so as a result of people feel very isolated or they feel that\nA Washington and the federal government in a way is not heating their concerns this is a place where up until a couple of years ago the many of the streets were unpaved or in the city literally a dirt road town so something that you would expect to not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty\nWhy is this now and it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative in effect for health care um Americans having to go across the border into Mexico to get health care I just want to make sure I understood that correctly\nThat's that's true and I even for a non critical carrier your dentist might be there are certainly other\n... and daily necessities might be there too so health both in an acute situation but also to and and just keeping yourself a fed keeping your family fed and making sure that that you have the basics of daily life this was a really the reality there and\nIf it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to to flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of them\nMake sure I understood that correctly that's that's true and I even for a non critical care your your dentist might be there are certainly a

the basics of daily life this was a really the reality there and\nIf it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to [noise]\nTo flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... where they have to come to bear\nOh it also seems to again also fly in there and the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall\nUm when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities\nYou know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country um and we'll be focusing on those throughout um throughout the week but tell us why you chose the places you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells a story that's different\nAbout the nation's war on poverty\nYou alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump or as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market is at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well must underscore that but\nThere are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that\nThey are struggling and might be an issue of education we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell it incredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where housing is such an issue on everyone's mind or

of many other places throughout the country whether it's the\nUh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana Flint, Michigan these are all places that are struggling that that have a reality that goes against what to what some leaders in Washington would like to have you believe\nAnd we've got about a minute left and obviously we've just got a couple of weeks left before the midterm elections what could those elections mean for communities like ...\nAll of this was happening with the backdrop of the mid term election and people have a choice to make their making it now in early voting in some states\nThey will certainly had the opportunity to to make that choice in November ... election days so for places like this are struggling they they face a

me I Want to be a narrator on the city that tell us more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent plays you take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and I'm at very young ages and um something that it's become a huge problem in in the United states how do you take a topic like that\nAnd bring it to the stage and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic well\nFor a while I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park Michigan which is a\nA I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit um and so because of that I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I've spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships to to teaching because of a it's a public school teachers and privates with teaching I've been in bowl\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles and so my play pipeline is about looking at it through a mother who's trying to raise her son but also a mother who's a teacher in a public school so we get to see her\nTeaching I spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships or to teaching because of a it's a public school teachers and privates with teaching I've been in bowl\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles I saw my flight pipeline is about looking at it through a mother who's trying to raise her son but also a mother who the teacher and a public school so we get to see\nHer relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and had relationships that private school system and we're looking at basically within the two forms of education how\nInstitutions can fail children an educator\nBoth in the public school maybe infrastructure ally but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not having enough space for the total humanity and their emotion out of the as young especially young black and brown boys and our nation and so that was important for me to try to explore\nOur producer who was putting the segment together found a an interview that you've done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now\nAs opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think you were referring there to the opportunities that women of color specifically have within a the creative fields\nTell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color play right\nWell I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochures of things\nFlavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now as opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think you were referring there to the opportunities the women of color specifically have within a the creative fields\nTell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color play right\n[noise] well I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochures of things and it looks like if a structural change you know you have to change in leadership and we're seeing that evidenced in large and small way that our nation right now right and leadership it comes from the top down\nAnd so on because that in theater in particular it it means\nProgramming is decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron How they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to\nHave a very diverse backgrounds and for women of color\nTo being more positions of power and where they are making those decisions that so I think we need to see\nA shift and that so the work that I Do as an artist my work is on stage but it's not just on the stage of off off the stage because it it is a time and the world while I feel that\nIt doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color on the audience there has\nTo be a an entire collective shift that invites audiences of diverse backgrounds inside the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalysts for\nAn Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make\nChange it starts first and foremost\nAge because it it it's a time and the world while I feel that\nIt doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color in the audience there has\nTo be a an entire collective shift that invites audiences of diverse backgrounds into the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\nIn Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development I think that there's an assumption about what people of color will and will not spend their money on and that is\n... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or wall spend it on things out of the significant is false I think it is also is about cultivating a relationship that makes people want to spend their money on something that's what the your head and figure it out but I Do also think\nAffordability of tickets is a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed in theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when you're talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means you cannot expect people to come to you\nLeave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house where I Know that I can cook [laughter] I have my food so it comes to your

global climate and how it impacts hundreds of millions of people around the world it means a whole lot\nScientists have been looking at how we might keep the warming of the planet to one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd researchers who just put out a new United Nations report on climate change say that goal is still possible but limiting warming to one point five degrees Celsius are about three degrees Fahrenheit would require huge changes to transportation land use and urban infrastructure that are unprecedented in human history we\nReally need to start working very hard right from know if we're not going to see the auction slip away so the message is indeed a very strong\nThat was Jim ... from the UN's inter governmental panel on climate change which released the report the rules Carolyn Beeler is here to tell us more about it this report found as possible to reach that one and a half degrees Celsius target but just how hard would it be\nWell hard as you mentioned that reports authors hundreds of them wrote that's Freddy inter governmental panel on climate change than there is quote no documented historic precedent for the scale of the economy wide changes we'd have to make to cut emissions enough to keep global warming to one point five degrees Celsius\nThat's because we'd have to cut carbon emissions roughly in half in roughly a decade and would actually have to reach net zero emission in just Thirty years I\nBe well hard as you mentioned the report's authors hundreds of them wrote this for the inter governmental panel on climate change said there is quote no documented historic precedent for the scale of the economy wide changes we'd have to make to cut emissions enough to keep global warming to one point five degrees Celsius\nThat's because we'd have to cut carbon emissions roughly in half in roughly a decade and would actually have to reach net zero emissions and just Thirty years\nI just want to underline how hard that would be to do it basically means that we have to reduce carbon emissions enough by twenty fifty that anything we met we can then sucked back out of the atmosphere by planting trees are taking other steps so that would be a huge undertaking\nYeah I mean people are already talking about how hard it is why Carolyn has this report focus exclusively on the differences between one and a half associates and to solve is in other words this is the difference between about three degrees Fahrenheit versus three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nBecause those are the two numbers that are written into the twenty Fifteen un climate change agreement so for a long time two degrees Celsius was sort of thought of as this kind of goal\nBut in Paris at the un conference in twenty Fifteen low lying island nations and really vulnerable countries like the Marshall Islands in Bangladesh banded together to push for this more ambitious target to be written into this global document so they got it in their\nBangladeshi climate advisor ... we'll talk with one of the people working behind the scenes to get that more ambitious target written into that taxed\nAt that time it was more of a moral argument that we wanted to save all the

is just for people on the planet\nYou okay so what would two degrees Celsius due to the whole world\nThis report filled out some really significant differences even though one point five and two degrees don't sound like that far apart for example um ten and a half million more people would be impacted by sea level rise under two degrees and hundreds of millions more people would frequently face extreme heat wave\nA natural habitats would shrink for a lot more animals\nAnd coral reefs would be all but destroyed whereas under one point five degrees of warming some would still be around\nYou twenty fifty is just around the corner so this is this is really sobering news um and like so much of what we hear about climate change kind of depressing where's the hoping this report\n[noise] well I think people like ... ... email hub in Bangladesh been pushing for this one point five degree target for a long time\nWould say they're happy that it's still technically feasible to reach that\nAnd also that this report that so thoroughly documented the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees will help focused even more on

Beeler there the winners of this year's Nobel Prize in economics or to American scholars who make connections between climate change and economic growth\nThe royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that William Nord house and Paul Romer were picked for their work on the most basic and pressing economic issues of our age\nNord house as a pioneer in environmental economics he started warning policymakers in the Nineteen seventies that their economic models were failing to take the impact of climate change into account\nNew York university professor Paul Romer helped create the modern approach to understanding innovation and how it relates to economic growth\nHe joins us now from NYU Stern school of business uh first of all professor congratulations I have you had a chance to speak out with your fellow winner William nor does\nNo I haven't I just wrote one of his nephew hoping that I could find out how to get in touch with Bill it's really a terrific honor to be linked together with him he's just a great scholar and max actually decent guy couldn't ask for better association\nSo your work is linked to the work of Dr north house how would you describe your work\nWe're both interested in not the kind of trade off that's common in economics like we can use this field to produce a little more corn or a little more wheat\nWhat Bill and I were focused on is the huge gains that can come from discovering new things the real source of progress for humans has been the discovery of new ideas that gives you more of both corn and wheat so that's a unifying element\nSo your

research looks at the discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about how that overlaps with the work of duck nor has an ... with climate change there is a very\nSimple model that would say something like oh the government's support basic scientific research by giving grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves the government giving money to professor so you know [laughter] they're they're keen on that but the truth is that most discovery and most learning comes from the work on specific problems and the academics often come along later and kind of clean up afterwards\nLike when people started working out how to use steam engines to do work it was much later that physicists came along and then then thermal\nSupport basic scientific research by giving grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves
