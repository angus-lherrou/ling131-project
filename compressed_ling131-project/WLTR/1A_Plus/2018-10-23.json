Andrea Bernstein\n[noise]\nI'm heavy Tobago welcome back to the take away and WNYC senior editor Andrea Bernstein co hosts of the Trump vague podcast is back in the studio with me ...\nFrom the Trump team takes us deeper behind the scenes of the Trump Organization in a report that reveals a disturbing pattern of deception and fraud Andrea great to have you back on the show\nAnd it's always great to be here so one of the questions we have is what is the Trump Organization is it a real estate company is it a construction company like why did they do so the Trump Organization starts out building buildings which is what Donald Trump's bother Fred had done\nThen Donald Trump drivers the pies and he goes into casinos a certain number of developments and he runs into an awful lot of trouble with the banks because his project start failing banks don't want to lend to him so that starts this new thing\nAround the beginning of this century where he starts licensing his name and that's the way that the Trump Organization has always presented it\nWe license our name we don't actually do the construction not what we found is that\nDonald Trump and his children even kind on junior in particular would go around and they would imply to people that their family had\nEquity stakes ownership stakes in projects and that the sales of these projects were going fantastically\nNinety percent sold sold out these are the kinds of terms that were being used when in fact\nThey didn't have an ownership stake they weren't sold out the way that they probably just restructured was it they would get their fees no matter what so they would get paid the project would frequently fail and people who had invested in them bought in would lose their money and the Trump swing move onto another project\nAnd say the same thing we had begun to see this and various projects but what we didn't realize was how consistent was\nAnd the trumps would move onto another project and say the same thing we had begun to see this in various projects but what we didn't realize was how consistent it was the fact that as a pattern was what was alarming to us because it suggests that it is a business model it's not just a fluke is not just a project or a couple of projects gone Matt\nAnd there's a about a dozen deals that you guys focus on in this episode and in particular there's one on the Trump ocean club in Panama City does a little bit about why that's so important so the Panama deal caught our attention for a few reasons one is\nThat Panama is a place in the world that has a low rating on scales of corruption meaning that it is very corrupt at the time the Trump Organization got in Transparency International rated it worse for example in Saudi Arabia very low worse than India\nSo this is a country that is also known for being a place where various narco traffickers want to run their money money laundering and want to run their money because there's all of this banking secrecy in Panama this is a project that went bankrupt\nAnd we have we serve on earth through this extraordinary process our colleagues at ProPublica on earth the audio tape up your bunker trumped in an interview she did in two thousand and eight where she was asked about this project\nAnd we have any projects or at least for a lot of building we've solved for Ninety percent of it and we saw that five hundred percent premium anything the luxury marketed ever scratch prior to our entry\nNone of those things were true and although the\nWas published the audio has never been heard before and you can hear how this mechanism works and it's okay to say I'm going to build the world's best building I'm going to build a such a beautiful building everybody\n... works and it's okay to say I am going to build the world's best building I'm going to build a such a beautiful building everybody's going to want to buy and there's actually a concept illegal concept noticed ... free which is fine you can say that it's when you start to make\nSpecific material representations and you do it repeatedly\nThat it becomes a question of whether there was actually a criminal fraud committed here now having said that a lot of this stuff happened a long time ago very far away so there are all kinds of questions of jurisdiction there are questions of statutes of limitation\nBut I think what this deep dime has done is really\nSort of make it clear to us that these are not fluke situations but they're actually a feature of the Trump business model and they sort of really changed the way that we view this licensing model which seemed like a really great idea of no banks want to lend to you you just sell your name you don't have to worry about getting the financing\nBut that is in fact what happened in fact what happened is they got people specifically to buy in based on lies and ms representations early on what is the Trump Organization\nUp to now it's funny that you mentioned the name and just over the weekend there were some New Yorkers who pulled a lot of money together to get the name off of their building and\nThey did they took they took like a cherry pick her up and took off the letters of this building which is something that's happened since from spin president there are still Trump projects around the world that they are actively working on their working in projects in the Dominican Republic they're working in projects in India\nThey're working in projects in Indonesia both Trump sons are now on on the campaign trail campaigning for the causes and candidates of their father but at the same time they're also going around the world selling\nCondos to potential investors that we don't know who they are also the president hasn't fully divested from\nOld selling condos to potential investors that we don't know who they are also the president hasn't fully divested from his businesses he has not there was even one point in twenty Seventeen when Eric Trump admitted to Forbes magazine they actually we're still talking about it\nOfficially he's given up the day to day control but he can still make money from it\nAnd that is the thing that ethics experts say is so confusing you never know in any given situation whether he is making a decision as\nThe head of the Trump Organization because he could have some personal profit or if he's doing it\nBecause he's the president of United States\nShouldn't that be I don't know illegal\n[noise] well I think to some extent what has happened with Donald Trump and it's it's sort of like broken the ethics systems for example the situation is just come up with regards to Saudi Arabia because he's done business with the Saudis\nAnd he took this initially sort of muted position on what looked like the murder of an American journalist resident\nIn Turkey and people were like well why is he doing that is it because of his business ties\nAnd the fundamental instability of this situation is that it's impossible to know now you also want to send out a little message to your listeners on the podcast go for it right so we have been hearing from some people who had bought in to Trump developments and we know there's a lot of takeaway listeners and in some of these places in\nHawaii in Florida\nA lot of people in the San Diego area bought into Baja California\nIn Chicago we're interested in hearing from

Nineteen Seventy eight to pregnancy discrimination act was passed to protect against discrimination based on pregnancy and childbirth or other related medical conditions but forty years later how well is the pregnancy discrimination act protecting the modern workforce Deborah\nIs an associate law professor at Emory University and she joins me now Debra thanks for being with us hello thanks for having me so tell us how is this law meant to protect pregnant women\n[noise] well what the pregnancy discrimination active Nineteen Seventy eight that and I'll call it the PTA is that men title seven of the civil rights\n[noise] well what the pregnancy discrimination active Nineteen Seventy eight does and I'll call it the PTA is it a men's title seven of the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four\nAnd peddle seven as the law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex as well as race color religion and national origin and what the PTA does is it the fine sex discrimination to include pregnancy\nAnd discrimination on the basis of related medical conditions including childbirth\nSo what are some of the limitations to this law I understand it's a conditional walk and you tell us what that means\nSo what the pregnancy discrimination act does if it says that you can't refuse to hire someone just because she's pregnant or you can't deny a promotion to pregnant women because you have stereotypes about motherhood\nAnd it requires that pregnant persons persons affected by childbirth be treated just the same as other persons who are similar in quote their ability or inability to work\nIt's a requirement effectively at the same treatment so the biggest limitation of the PTA is that it's\nOnly an anti discrimination mandate and it leaves many workers\nBereft of protection and so what it doesn't require doesn't guarantee enough ferment of entitlement turn accommodation in the workplace so let's magic in a managerial professional in a fortune five hundred company whose fortunate enough I'm lucky enough to work in a workplace that gives generous\nPaid leave so if she broke her legs she could get say four weeks of paid leave\nSimilarly if she became pregnant and ... needed leave before childbirth or after childbirth she could get four weeks of paid childbirth because she would be treated the same\nBut let's imagine people who work in warehouses like in the recent New York\nFour weeks of paid childbirth because she would be treated the same\nBut let's imagine people who work in warehouses like in the recent New York times article they work in low income jobs um where they are much less likely to have generalized protections for disability so their employer gives no for example no light duty accommodations to any worker when they fall ill\nIn the workplace and anti discrimination mandate does not get you very far\nSo just the requirement under the PTA that pregnant workers be treated the same as other temporarily disabled workers doesn't get that much protection so they won't be given light duty which poses a risk to their health and the health of their fetuses\nNow I Wonder is does this have anything to do with the fact that pregnancy is considered a disability clause in this law because it feels like we're we're treating pregnancy the same as we would quote unquote disability is not as a separate category is that right\nYeah the law it's important to recognize does not actually mention the word disability what the law says is that sex discrimination under title seven includes pregnancy and then it gives you an example and it says that for example\nPregnant women should get the same benefits as other employees who are similar or in their ability or inability to work\nSo it might be helpful to explain a little bit where this idea of temporary disability came from\nFeminists lawyers in the seventies were really worried that any law that specially protected pregnant women would lead to hiring discrimination\nAnd so they promoted kind of an approach that with sex neutral that analogy eyes between pregnancy and temporary disability in order to use anti discrimination as a kind of bootstrap to get pregnant women some of the benefits that were available for temporarily disabled\nIn order to use anti discrimination as a kind of bootstrap to get pregnant women some of the benefits that were available for temporarily disabled workers generally\nAnd to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of pregnancy but again this um leaves the workers who most need protection for rest of protection because it doesn't provide a positive entitlement to the kinds of accommodations that are necessary for the health and safety of pregnant workers\nNow how does this law changed I'm In the past forty years and what do you see is the future of it\nThat law has evolved to 'em so for example and the two thousand Fifteen decision young the UPS the Supreme Court expanded what would count as disparate treatment on the basis of pregnancy or what would count as kind of a differential treatment of pregnancy that was unlawful [noise]\nSo if an employer for example gives accommodations to a large percentage of its workforce\nFor whatever reason but not to pregnant workers that now can be considered unlawful another advance and the law we've seen is that stereotyping pregnant women\nIs itself in a way that leads to kind of an adverse employment action of firing or a failure to promote or a denial of benefits that those kinds of gender stereotypes are themselves unlawful what gender stereotypes are you referring to well for example I think that one of the calls I'm\nThe woman from New Jersey who\nWas told by her supervisor that she needed to take more time off\nWork or have a kind of less demanding job because she should spend more time with a baby\nThose are the kinds of gender stereotypes that are actually I'm Still very prevalent the notion that a new mother won't be able to be as committed to the workforce because she's now committed\nTo her child more than she is her job\nThe notion that a new mother won't be able to be as committed to the workforce because she's now committed to her child more than she has a hard job those are the kinds of gender stereotypes that could be proud of unlawful sex discrimination I got the PTA\nDeborah dinner is associate law professor at Emory University and she has a book coming out called the sex equality dilemma ... work family and legal change Neal liberal America there but thanks for joining I\n... Hi this is Lena from Dallas texas\nAbsolutely no combinations were made for me working as a clerk inside a UPS I was on my feet all day ... get into chair given no it certainly changed lives in the job I worked for nearly two years for\nAnd they didn't care that I got pregnant and around my five or six month mark a pregnancy I just checked out disability leads they still haven't made any accommodations for me to come back so I eventually just had to take my maternity leave early and\nQuit I'm Sharon still from Portland, Oregon\nI was really fortunate because I'm I worked at a big university hospital in San Francisco and they are for six weeks maternity leave but right before my due date it was discovered that for my colleagues and I were inadvertently underpaid\nSo I wound up getting four months off with my new baby which was a great thing because he was a terrible sleeper and that saved our lives I Can't believe the standard is six weeks Europe has it right\nIn\nOrder to protect when it comes from babble or European made language learning program babble teachers practical composition and into your Russian Swedish and other languages available\nFrom babble European made language learning programs that will teaches practical conversation in Italian Russian Swedish and other languages available in the app store or online at B.

S. it's become a political issue ahead of the midterms President Trump strikes a conspiratorial tone when he says hardened criminals and middle Easterners are heading toward the U.S those claims have no evidence by the way\nThe Mexican government is handling the situation as a humanitarian one\nAnd middle Easterners are heading toward the U.S those claims have no evidence by the way the Mexican government is handling the situation as a humanitarian one Danielle ... is a former spokesman in President Enrique opinion yet the government is now a political consultant beyond says Mexico's government is currently walking a tightrope\nOn the one hand you have your ... ally and your biggest partner putting pressure on you and also recruit and I think the fact that you need to protect your own borders and you're you're only allowed well on the other hand there's like the whole movement in the public opinion of Mexico saying\nGuys we should treat the Central Americans as we require the American roots are Mike Rounds up on the north\n[noise] what about right now we're seeing Mexican police in riot gear some of them look like they're ready to go to battle what rights to the Mexican immigration laws give the migrants right now we're traveling through the country\nLook that for decades Mexican southern border has been very ...\nMeaning that we have like four years hundreds of thousands of immigrants from South and Central America traveling from Mexico\nWe have heavily invested in the country now we're southern border there to provide more facilities for legal crossing and to provide humanitarian be set for those traveling to the north\nAnd yet Mexican police fired tear gas at some of the migrants enclosed aboard or did you see that as a serious effort or just for ...\nWhat I see that Mexican police work or not they were having the shells and and the guy said but they were not carrying guns because that was the limit they said like they didn't want cash right these ... these clashes\nSo the Mexican police had no live ammunition could Mexican police and security stop the migrants that they wanted to could they forced them back south they could do\nMake cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries\nGuatemala Honduras and El Salvador they've been receiving ... twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent in twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars in financial assistance to the region we wanted to know what but it actually goes to\nSarah appears as with the migration Policy Institute in Washington\nSo what has been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nTo use for a wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the northern triangle country is the alliance for prosperity this is a program that arose out of a separate migration crisis that we had in two thousand fourteen when a lot of company in child migrants arrived at our southern border\nPresident Obama at that time and knowledge that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root cause and and look at what's going on in these home countries to cause people to to fleeing and really have this mass exodus\n... alliance for prosperity is designed to increase economic prosperity and those countries and strengthen institutions because there's a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our\nOur major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to the end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador Ken the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress just slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but no he cannot do that unilaterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries he really need to wait until they come back in session after November\nBecause Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries he'd really need to wait until they come back in session after November\n... or how political do see this move being as it's only the Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran immigration he saw that\nIssue when him the election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms so this caravan effectively as a political gift to him and Republicans in that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country quote unquote from this caravan\nTrump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala a about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle countries and Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we had a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think will will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those reforms to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for certain reforms to the asylum system including changing asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like us care of and so that um it operates more efficiently because right now\nChanging asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like us care of and so that um it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the care of and apply for asylum\nThey'll likely be placed in our immigration court backlog which stretches on for years so lovely waiting in the United states and the way down the line\nAnd immigration court judge will have to pick up their case and started from scratch and see if it's in sincere asylum application\nIn reality we'd like to see a a more efficient system operating at the southern border so where we're working really hard to to kind of push out that idea and and stress the importance of granting asylum to
