T.\nThe races attracting international attention in large part because of most of NATO was extreme views on torture homosexuality and state sponsored violence if successful Brazil would be the latest country swept up in a wave of populist leaders\nAnd for Brazilians this fall a tile election comes after years of economic instability and political turbulence wholly unfair to the Brazilian writer and he joined me from Sao paolo to trace the roots of the upcoming election\nThe first moments where you can find relevant would be two thousand protein when many people to to the streets to protest the beauty government at first it was a left wing protests as we tended to have here in Brazil\nAnd then in the meantime let's go to the first one the second one it when it got bigger and bigger ...\nIt was a simulated does a a right wing movement and then from then on the started organizing themselves or they went to the streets are against it again in two thousand Fifteen\nAsking for do mode roof says beach men and then after a while they got that and well all this structure that\n... says beach meant and then after a while they got that and well all this structure that was against the tea\nNow is supporting John you both so now do this stream right politician and things got really ugly in that point\nWhy do you think in ... there six string to the point where last see not only ... could potentially be elected\nWell uh I think it has something of a sudden character because well I don't believe that we have a fifty percent of a population tend to fire ride thoughts I mean it just to be ten percent thoughts\nEvery last election and less Thirty years but then there was so much rage and so much hatred and there was also a media campaign against the tea and focusing a lot in the corruption scandals that we're serious obviously\nBut they weren't only ... the fall and then people this range and hatred became a support for this terrible character this terrible guy\nThat people tend not to see all they see and maybe they don't want to have the exact conscience of while they are actually supporting\nIs bullshit not exploiting on any of the conditions that exist to social divisions that exist in Brazil right now\nWell definitely mainly the middle class in satisfaction because well er during the the workers' party governments during the Thirteen years they were in power\nThere was significant growth for the poorest but middle class the states\nSo ... years they were in power\nThere was significant growth for the poorest but middle class stayed more or less the same so they were after awhile closer to the poorest than to the reaches [noise]\nAnd this created some sort of dissatisfaction through a great part of of a population\nAnd now I think both so NATO is exploiting exactly that and pass the support of these people even though his his policies won't do anything good for them they tend to do a lot well\nFor the reaches not for the middle class\nAnd I want to read an excerpt from an essay you broach and ask you to to tell us a little bit about it in in your essay you said quote\nIt Brazil were not drowning under so much rage so much hatred sandwich yelling if there were just a single moment of silence perhaps everybody would be able to hear the alarm bell sounding something is in danger\nIn many ways putting on this feels a lot like the moment in the United states that were living right now are you concerned about what you see is what's happening in Brazil and also what's happening across the world\nDefinitely it's a great a reason for concern and well perhaps we are now in the frontline of something a lot bigger\nI'd like to consider it a backlash of many other advances we've had in this last decades and Brazil this seems to be the case at least\nBecause there was this a progressive governments for Thirteen Years and then you have this reaction that very conservative and besides the reactionary in Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have been in the United states it's being the only Thirty years\nReactionary in Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have in in the United states it's been only Thirty years of democracy at this point\nSince the last dictatorship and you never know when the military will get in the way again we'll start gaining power and becoming something else so it's a great reason for concern definitely\n[noise] and in terms of those ... society who would be most vulnerable under a ball for NATO presidency\nWell first of all that's not really the poorest because he has a very violent program for fighting crime organized crime and without considering the risks of that\nThan arming great parts of the population than giving a license for policemen to kill without any\nSerious investigation so we know that in in the ... we'll see a lot more blood then we see now which is very serious\nAnd of course there will be also persecution of the aisle you beat the community because he's been talking about that's his entire career women will suffer because well he he tends to be against policies of the quality\nThe indigenous community as well he doesn't want to preserve the land and the original black communities as well so it's mainly the most vulnerable will suffer more\nAnd we don't know if that will be something similar to what we had during the dictatorship that bus persecution of viruses than those activists\nHe has said things that point to that idea but we are not sure\nThe ... and the activists he has said things that's going to that idea but we are not sure how he was planning to do that or if he's planning to do that at this point is just a vague meant it\nAnd will not if people don't want to see what it's called\n... says the

dumbest thing I ever heard of [noise] they don't\nWant me to you because of it out for two hundred years ago\nThat the film's protagonist Peter who returns home to fight for his land in Louisiana as he tries to court his love interest Maria when I sat down with Sasha he told me why the films still resonates with viewers in twenty Eighteen\nLand ownership is an important part of the story and there was a statistic that someone in the film said that like every week black folks are losing a thousand acres of land and\nBy the year X Y Z black people won't have anything and I thought that was a really powerful idea this sense this idea of ownership and land ownership and the relationship that cultures have to the land in as people who have who are of African native dissent\nHaving this relationship and report the land and this ownership of the land in this you know sort of European system of\nWhat it means to own land well we're here so if we're going to participate we might as well be owners as well that was an important sort of subplot in this story that when your mixed in with feminism color is in class there's a lot there\nDid you learn anything about your dad that you didn't now I didn't have a sense of through this film well\nYou know my parents split when I was young and\nHe moved on to another relationship the the woman that he was in a relationship with before he died\nShe's from the region and she worked on the film and had a hand in sort of glowing him into the world and why it's interesting and important but inside of the romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents\nBut inside of the romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents you know what that courtship might've been like because it was there's something very\nI don't want to say simple but something so tender about the way the characters interact that it's it's very genuine that you can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny you know I mean someone said recently who saw the film but it it has a very eighties vibe what does that mean well I was a kid in the eighties silly than well you'll if you're a kid from the eighties you will love the\nParents have designer jeans everyone's we're rocking designer jeans everyone's but male and female looks great there's a photo Matt you know I don't know for those who are old enough to ... days we used to have to take film right actually get a developed right at a little hot that was usually stationed in a parking lot it was a photo Matt\nYou know so the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really slow the pacing everything so quick now\nBut I think the pacing of the film is\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling the story of how my father would make everyone listened to the soundtrack he made me listen to it too that's the one thing that I always remembered\nBut in some instances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way was kind of ahead of its time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely a the way it is\nBy super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely the way it is\nDo you think that when you look at black film today in twenty eight teams\nDo you think that there is enough nuance uh black everyday life in those films similar to the way that your dad was able to bring that life is I think that is one of the most compelling things that you're talking about is just how nuanced and how delicate these portrayals word do you see the filmmakers are getting better at that\nWell I think Hollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to beat and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but\nHollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes by marketing money\nOkay this very specific group of black people like these hair care products or you can sell stuff to people I get it but I think this sort of box that that same litter you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small\nIt doesn't fit anymore and um you look at you know my man child is can be no you know you look at this sort of new wave of okay here are some other black people to who have stories to tell who are great and so\nI have hope that things are changing but you know changed never comes as quickly as you'd like\nYou're also a filmmaker are there any projects um that you're working on coming out\nWorking on a four part film about the Wu Tang clan there twenty fifth anniversary this year and um [noise]\nTo really understand Wu Tang clan I mean you can listen to their music and enjoyed it sounds great but like to really peel back the lyrics to have a real understanding of who they are and where they come from and as I tell people all the time to understand hip hop or blues jazz you know all these art forms or reflection of in a reaction to the environment\nBlues jazz you know all these art forms of reflection of in a reaction to the environment and so to tell the story you got to understand the environment all the things that they went through to become who they are and so\nTo me the music is the cherry on top it's all the other stuff the environment the social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling\nIs there anything that you're taking away from your dad filmmaking process and incorporating it into the work that you do\nWell saying something every time I have the opportunity to make a film I say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop fashion and you\nYou learn about a Sunday Best and most people you say Sunday Best and they think it means we're nice suit but they don't realize it means that in certain states it was mandated by their slaves and nice\nOutfit so they can go to church worship God
