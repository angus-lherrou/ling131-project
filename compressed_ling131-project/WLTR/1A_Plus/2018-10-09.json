Hurricane Matthew tore through the area the first category five Atlantic hurricane in nearly ten years for residents of lumber to North Carolina in rural ... county the devastation was inescapable\n[noise] arch it affected your show which in effect that base it on on that God made forty days but\nIt was just deja vu for these residents the damage was just horrible\nThat's Ashley ... a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity and I talked to her about reporting in Lumberton and whether or not residents stories were reflected in the rosy economic picture touted by the Trump Administration lumber\nTen North Carolina it's a it's one of the most diverse rural counties in the country actually um you have about a third white a third black third lumpy Native American and a growing Hispanic population so it it's a very interesting kind of make up there\nAnd of course we're looking at this series through the sort of idea that the president of the United states has recently and said that we solved the war on poverty that were good when it comes to poverty but Lumberton is actually one of the poorest an unhealthy is the most dangerous counties in North Carolina tell us about what that looks like\nYeah so I visited twice a this summer and this fall first to kind of see what the town looked like after being hit by Hurricane Matthew twenty sixteen and do you could still see a lot of the destruction from that long ago you would see\nPiles of sand that had come from under the river that people hadn't cleared out I'm Still some furniture\nSome houses that just were very dilapidated in some areas where they had already torn down the entire house and there was just a green space\nAnd what about the impact of Hurricane Florence\nYeah so they got pummeled again I'm almost two years to the day um which\nWas just horrible because when I was there in July you would still see all of this destruction but I was talking to a lot of people who are finally getting their lives back together um one woman I saw her the day that she got into her new home that was just rebuilt\nAnd then Florence head and the same thing happens all over again her houses with flooded and I heard that story time and time again\nAnd are there any people or groups in particular that these residents would like to see more from I'm Wondering about FEMA um or any other organizations\nFEMA's down of ground Red Cross has been on the ground there was an issue with Hurricane Matthew with HUD money with housing and urban development money that hadn't come through from the state\nI think about ten percent of the money that was gifted from the federal government with actually distributed so people are saying well okay the money hasn't come not time around then and that's two years later so what's going to happen with Hurricane Florence money um how would I was going to work\nSo Chris Howard the Lumberton resident we heard from earlier echoed those same concerns in trying to get help rebuilding his house\nAbout it but now it just getting medication stage which\nWe don't know what was going on because they are telling me that [noise]\n[noise] we don't go to me that\nI talked to many residents that one either or to discourage to even apply for aid because they were told that they would never get it\nDenials are very frequent FEMA admits that and they say you just have to apply again but that's really discouraging to residents\nOne person that I spend a lot of time with a mistake and Powell she actually went back and forth with FEMA twelve different times talking to different\nRepresentatives having to tell her story again hearing conflicting things you need this piece of information you need this to the point where she just gave up on that process so the recovery for a lot of people that need it the most\nThat were really hit badly and are in shelters are staying with family members the system isn't really working from them and the way that it's meant to\nThis is a district that was reliably democratic but did end up voting for President Trump who has said as we mentioned earlier that the war on poverty is over is that a disconnect for the residents of Lumberton also at the time\nBut it was very interesting as I said before just showing up matters and during the hurricane a lot of the people I talked to said we saw Donald Trump's bus we saw the big name Trump on the side of the bus we saw Lara Trump passing out water bottles to us and that was really memorable and we didn't see Hillary Clinton\nDonald Trump also was kind of talking to the points that really resonated with Robin ... such as I'm going to get rid of NAFTA a lot of people say took a ton of the manufacturing jobs out of the county um I'm not sure\nHow much they think that he's held up their promises but at the time he seems to be speaking right to them\nWhere does lumber to go from here obviously there\nHow much they think that he's held up their promises but at the time he seemed to be speaking right to them\nAnd where does lumber to go from here obviously there are a mid term elections coming up in a couple of weeks though there's probably still a lot more recovery to be done where did they go from here\nYeah so that's something I was trying to piece together when I was there because you still have hundreds of people in shelters and maybe voting is the last thing on their minds are they weren't really politically engaged to begin with that is one of the reasons we chose rather than county they have a very low turnout rate\nYou're trying to rebuild you may not be living in your house you maybe with a family member\nSo board of elections are saying well we can send you an absentee ballot you can vote from anywhere\nWe're sending them to shelters we extended the voter registration date by three days but people are that I talked to are saying well I don't know if these measures are enough so it'll be interesting to see who does come out for this election if they're if they're angry enough with\nBeing hit twice in two years and don't feel like they've been paid attention to is that if that will matter or if again they're just going to be struggling to stay afloat\nActually both of his act as a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity Ashley thanks for being with us

and beyond if you want to vote this November this is your reminder to please go register\nAnd leading up to election day we've heard a lot about election meddling whether by Russia China some guy in a basement or otherwise but what's not been in the media spotlight is ensuring fair access to the polls for everyone in the United states who wants to cast a ballot\nHurdles for voters are now getting thrown up across the country just this year the American civil liberties union filed a federal lawsuit against Arizona saying to stay put more than five hundred thousand voters\nAt risk of being disenfranchised and in June a federal judge struck down at Kansas law that required proof of citizenship to register to vote it was deemed a violation of the national voter registration act\nJessica who's minutes here to tell us more she's a reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for election land a coalition of news rooms covering problems with voting and twenty Eighteen\nJessica thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me I appreciate it help us understand what's happening here we know that since twenty sixteen there'd been a couple of changes as we mentioned at the top who uh affecting really voter disenfranchisement who can and can't vote in this country what some of those changes been so there\nA lot of states that have um issued new voter ID laws or there are states that have redrawn they're voting boundaries um to make it more difficult for your voice to be heard um in terms of gerrymandering and making\nDistricts far more partisan than they once were and this is sort of been a slow progression states have also a become a little bit more um bold in terms of um cleaning the voter rolls and sometimes that\nIs sometimes that crosses the line into purging um and and so there are there\nIn terms of um cleaning the voter rolls and sometimes that\nIs sometimes that crosses the line into purging um and and so there are there have been a lot of actions especially in the last two years to make these things happen so there's going to be in this election it's going to be the first time that a lot of these laws are in place and are expecting at least a little bit of confusion at the polls\nLet's talk about that because um we talked a little bit about you know cleaning and purging what's the difference there between cleaning the voter rolls and purging the voter rolls I think there are lots of civil rights activists who say this is really an effort to purge and keep communities of color and other folks off of the voter rolls what are you seeing\nYou know I think that it really depends on who you ask I think I'm there I think there's no election administrator red and yellow purple agreeing that would tell you that that voter roll maintenance is bad I think we all have an interest in making sure that people who are no longer\nLiving in our communities or who are no longer eligible to vote for whatever reason remain on the voter roll 'em but there are states that do this and in a in a particularly aggressive way that might make it more likely that a person who\nAnd said doesn't check their email very frequently or wouldn't know to respond to it'd be a specific male or or doesn't vote regularly would be more likely to be purged from the voter roll 'em\nSo for example the Houston case which the Supreme Court decided just recently\nAllowed the state of Ohio to remove people from the rule if they didn't respond to a few mailers and also didn't vote in and I think two elections and so if you think about the people who are least likely to respond to a postcard that looks very much like junk mail or for being honest\nAnd then also not regularly turned out to vote 'em those might be people who are are minorities or the poor or the elderly who are least likely to vote any way and so they might be at higher risk for getting purged from the rolls that it really depends on who you ask\nPoor or the elderly who are least likely to vote anyway and so they might be at higher risk for getting purged from the rolls that it really depends on who you ask how severe they believe that problem is if you talk to someone like the Brennan Center they're going to tell you that it's a crisis if you talk to someone like the public interest legal foundation they're going to tell you what's in good\nPractice practice but I Want to push back a little bit there because when I get a notice for jury duty and clear what that noticed is I don't think anybody Mrs notices like that why aren't these notices clear or are they seem somewhat deceptive if you're at that noticed is I don't think anybody Mrs noticed is that why aren't these notices\nClear or are they seem somewhat deceptive if you're taking people off the rules and not making it clear that you've done that I mean doesn't isn't that somewhat anti democratic so I think\nThat that's not necessarily the case in a lot of states there the mailers I agree could be a lot clearer um but they do send the mailers more than one time\nOver a period of a couple of years I'm an ... that said though people are very likely to ignore them even if they get them a couple of times like I'm not sure that I Would take a look at a postcard and realize\nThat the cat that consequences for not responding to it\nIs that I might be removed from the voter roll\nOr helps if the language was in huge big bold letters and that is when you get a jury summons and it clearly says if you don't show up you're gay rested\nI Want to turn around for a second here because what happens at twenty sixteen election there were and I covered this there were lots of threats at the polls a more that the fear of people being threatened when they showed up at the polls\nI'm In peoples claiming to sort of want to implement these checks and balances when they got there are you seeing that for the midterms is there are there is that that many levels of concern in terms of who can and can't vote you mentioned confusion at the polls wasn't that going to look like so\nThink that what we're more likely to see and this was the case says well into thousands sixteen and we anticipate it ahead of the two thousand and sixteen election\nThe head of the two thousand sixteen election um a lot of voter intimidation that was on the news every day there were people actually actively making threats about intimidating voters at the polling it costing them there that didn't actually happen um\nIn two thousand sixteen we only saw that a couple of very isolated locations and not for very long and it didn't appear to be any sort of an organized effort and so\nEven if we start hearing sort of threats ahead of the mid term elections I think that people should be really wary of the idea that someone's going to scream at them in front of their polling location that is actually not a threat that we have seen and but the talk of that threat\nIn and exaggerating its likelihood would prevent some people from turning out to the polls so I really want to stress\nThat we did not see that in twenty sixteen and we don't necessarily expect to see that in twenty Eighteen well we did see even twenty sixteen and what we do anticipate seeing and twenty six twenty Eighteen\nIs confusion around new laws so for example and twenty six team to Texas voter id law was implemented um and it wasn't even necessarily that the law itself disenfranchised people but because there were so confusion about what the law actually say\nThat back when you said they didn't actually disenfranchised people the voter id doesn't of voter id require you to have an idea and a lot of people don't have\nThe right it does but in Texas and twenty sixteen there was a reasonable impediment declaration even fill out and that was not appropriately implemented across the state and so that and the the miss information in terms of what voters expected and what poll workers are trained to do disenfranchised quite a lot of people and so we expect to see the same sort of confusion and twenty a cheat around new laws [noise]\nJust a guy who's been as a reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for

conversation about sexual assault and harassment that may have helped some women in the hotel industry achieve the goal they've been fighting for for a long time getting their employers to do more to protect them from sexual assault\nWas made headlines a few years back when a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss Kahn the former head of the IMF of sexual assault that case was settled out of court but the problem never went away here's the world's Alison at at a\nImagined is you're a woman working in an office and you're in the middle of the meeting all of a sudden your meal coworker starts to undress it's hard to imagine that happening right well if you're a hotel housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not three times and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm going to put my key and I'm going to in the room so this particular time you know I'm not answered there isn't I mean there's gas has been an air completely ...\nThat's ... she's a housekeeper at a large hotel in Chicago she asked me not to use her last name or the name of the hotel where she works she's worried about how speaking out my impact her job she says that when this happened she was more than just scared\nLike it just it made me feel discuss the angry so I just kinda like mad or just left\nShe reported it tour manager but she says nothing was done\nSo it's one of those things happen so much in housekeeping where your managers kinda feel like it was just a normal and they just say okay you don't go back sit around today\nBut she did have to go back she brought another woman so she wouldn't have to be alone and fortunately that gas wasn't there but he wasn't asked to leave so in twenty sixteen when members of her union UNITE HERE wanted to ask her and her co workers some questions\nBut he wasn't asked to leave so in twenty sixteen when members of her union UNITE HERE wanted to ask her and her co workers some questions about sexual assaults on the job she knew this was her chance to make change happen\nI'm like oh okay and one of my coworkers within the next ... and she's like you know just kind of knows me like you know they come and talking about sexual harassment and I'm I'm like this is our opportunity\nTo kind of share things that we deal with everyday with Tony and other housekeepers in the union set out to survey more than five hundred women about their experiences on the job\nNearly sixty percent of women they talked with dealt with some form of assault by hotel guest that lead to action last year housekeepers in Chicago successfully lobbied for a device to keep them safe it's called the panic button\nAnd it was part of the city wide campaign known as hands off pants on\nSo this is one solution\n[noise]\nIt's it's send a message that I was in danger in that room\nThat's already for her age she's the head of housekeeping at the ... hotel she shows me how the safety device works press the button and hotels security is on the way [noise]\nHoge emigrated here from the nineties from what was then Yugoslavia she's always worked as a housekeeper\nHer story is not uncommon according to a study done by the American immigration council the top occupation for foreign born women here in the U.S is housekeeping\nWas nearly nine hundred thousand women working in this sector\nFor judge having the panic button has made her and her staff safer I honestly think is a great think it is great that Chicago hotels are required to give this device to housekeepers\nTo meet her and her staff safer I honestly think is a great team it is for the Chicago hotels are required to give this device to housekeepers but sexual assault in the hotel industry is a global issue so what are some of these larger chains like Mary I tuned to keep their workers safe say in Paris or to buy\nTheir such heightened awareness around safety and security so we're dialing up in the space but I think it's important to remember there was no one magic answer\nThat's Erica Alexander she's the chief lodging services officer from Marriott International she's talking about the new devices the rolling up in the U.S and Canada but the company has no current plans to put panic buttons into the hands of their workers in other countries\nThat for us it's a huge problem because we understand that you know the Mariette brand should be doing the right thing whether they're here in the United states around the world\nThat can be fined gold she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers from Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working in South Africa and around the globe to push for hands off pants on campaign\nIf there is a practice that's happening here in the United states and Mary I can do it here in the United states they can do it in China where they had a massive investment and expansion they can do it throughout Asia throughout Latin America\nBefore the me too movement last year housekeepers like ... didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety on the job [noise] they've been trying for years to get their employers to protect them\nAnd then all of a sudden all of this stuff started showing up in the news and I'm just like ... incredible on my because ... like we\nWe all have to say like we've\nStarted something and they have\nIncredible on my book could do like we we have all had the same feeling like we've started something\nAnd they have five of the major hotel chains have promised to install panic buttons in all their hotels nationwide by twenty twenty but for so many people around the globe working is housekeepers there's no button that can press to stop them from being assaulted on the job\nFor the

example but getting intel can also be as easy as going online and doing a few searches the investigative news websites belly cat and the insider did boats\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G R U Russian Army intelligence\nOur told her as one of the belly cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had released about the cover daddy said this guy so we now know his real name is Aleksandr ... but before he was ... he's not as Oksana Petra which was have coverage is totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel and\nUm and so we had some information about that cover I get ... birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise] I'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point so\nTalk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have to starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information\nTalk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably\nUse some of the same information to discover identity from his real identity [noise] so we looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are leaked um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're leaked the databases\nFrom driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find if you just know where to look and sort of cross reference everything we could find and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan like the same birth dates and this from roughly the same village in the middle of nowhere\nAnd northern Russia and after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to this tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ before he went to school [laughter]\nHe was he a DJ at the local club one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village\nSo we once these hunters in these databases of cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think would probably matched the true identity of Michigan\nI go to say some of the steps in in your process to you and your investigators really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of\nA mini vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail from a spy on Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information has had no way forever but again these spies have real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that we tracked back to them so I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic retain research on this stuff you wanted and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for any interesting details cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the crumbling [noise] yeah I mean this guy\nWhat else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the crumbling\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is lifted his registered addresses as the headquarters of the ... which went first glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public address like on his driver's license the address of the you know ... the equivalent of the CIA\nWell he did it because uh you know if it gets pulled over in his car the cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually you know everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found is three hundred and five men\nAll between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nWho all have the same register to address it just says one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you and they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address who's I guess I Want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get pulled over for drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services\nSo really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how a lot of the ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange slumping as to what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and has but intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose it's always possible right because we know every time any investigation of the nation I Russia people always chimed in and saying well they want you to find it very well if they want us to find a wise no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration through these vehicles to the jury you headquarters\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agencies address same like jury you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\n[noise] a few weeks ago\nAddress same like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\nA few weeks ago your website building cat identified as a second person allegedly

and I don't think Elliot our founder has contacts educate police either um so we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in this all completely news and then we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spy in the digital age\nIt depends I I I get I don't know I have no idea I've never worked in the intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's much much harder than ever done before\nThat was our solar with the
