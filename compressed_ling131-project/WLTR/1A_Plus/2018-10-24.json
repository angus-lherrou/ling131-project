don't Jay Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United states\nSo we want to take some time today to do some fact checking on this caravan of migrants coming from Central America but if\nAt Sirte given by MS or you're going to buy Middle Eastern\nYou're going to find everything I guess what we're not allowed in our guts\nHere to help us unpack all of this is Ron Nixon the New York times correspondent covering the department of homeland security Ron thanks for being with us and thanks for having me\nSo lots of stuff to take a into consideration here we just heard the president's comments about uh they're being middle Easterners and the caravan he later said he had no proof of that but\nClearly this was a dog whistle I'm thinking who within the caravan Ron what do we know\nThese are people that are primarily migrating and speaking to a asylum primarily coming from Honduras and I understand that there's some people from Guatemala and maybe a couple of other places in the northern trying all countries [noise] but uh it looks largely like it's it's a group of people coming from Honduras\nNow we also heard I'm Mike Pence vice president Mike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who were saying that there are about ten terrorists or suspected terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that\nMike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who were saying that there are about ten terrorists or suspected terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that they are set around this caravan let's take a listen to a vice president Pence\nWell it's inconceivable that there are not um people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward our border\nIn can insurance is well let me let me is statistics on this I mean in in the last fiscal year\nAh we apprehended more than more than ten terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border\nUh from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as other than Mexico that means from the middle east region\nRon does other than Mexico mean from the middle east\nOther than Mexico includes everybody from Mexico and they know it's not a direct okay no I Know including people from the northern triangle and and that's primarily who's been referred to as other than in Mexico but it it really does include anyone who is not from Mexico and nuts because\nTraditionally up until a few years ago most of the people seeking to come across the border either get asylum or crossing the border illegally were uh people from Mexico\nAnd non what about those stats the vice president is citing about terrorists being apprehended at the border\nThat staff that the vice president mentions come from um customs and border protection the parent agency of border patrol\nAnd it basically says that the agency prevents ten known or suspected terrorists from traveling to are entering the United states every day and fiscal two thousand ah Seventeen it makes no mention of them being apprehended at the border uh and it doesn't say specifically that their\nSo two thousand ah Seventeen it makes no mention of them being apprehended at the border uh and it doesn't say specifically that they're coming to the southwest border that typically has meant that these people are being stopped from coming the airports so\nYeah it it's called fleeting as that that is meant to be one thing with\nThis whole caravan it and it has nothing to do as far as I can tell with this caravan of people he's\nAlso made some claims about MS Thirteen and I don't want to minimize the concern about him is Thirteen um but I Do want to check with you to see is there any evidence of MS Thirteen still far being a part of this group or having any influence over this group\nI haven't seen anything that that suggests that MS Thirteen is is a part of a group in the president's comments about ticket camera and go in the middle of a caravan and you'll see him as Thirteen I I don't know what MS Thirteen would look like I mean there are certainly\nYou know a members that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who's ... him as Thirteen looks like that so [noise]\nYou know as far as as I Know and from my colleagues on the ground there and and my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles out when it comes to race and politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans nervous here on do you think that's why they're doubling down on this rhetoric just two weeks before the midterm election\nI think immigration I'm you know obviously it it helped a president could elected and this has been one of if not the signature issue for this administration and I think that for a lot of Republicans ... place while a particularly now\nStigma true issue for this administration\nAnd I think that for a lot of Republicans ... place while a particularly now you see cameras with this crowd of people coming to the country and you can point to see they're they're they are there are these people who are trying to to get into our country um so I think for them you know it's it's an issue\nOr that they feel they can gain some traction with as you know political scientists and pollsters are predicting a blue wave particularly uh in in terms of taking the house of representative\nYeah we've also heard a Mike Pence said that it is a the caravan of the Venezuelan plot um the president has suggested that the caravan is being supported by Democrats and George ... his name has been tossed about can we confirm any of those claims\nThere is no evidence that the Democrats are George Soros or Venezuela have sponsors of this particular caravan and remember this is uh something that happened earlier this year too there was a caravan of people coming to the U.S and most of them\nActually didn't make the trip to the U.S it it sort of petered out before it actually got to the U.S border so ultimately we don't know what's going to happen with this group of people because they're about a thousand miles away\nRight which is more than Miami to New York from when I Am right now yeah right and they're walking right so\nTake that into consideration thank

Francisco and she's been reporting on the measure as well as the origins of the practice and the case against it today\nDanielle thanks for being with us on the takeaway thank you for having me so what is where did this ballot measure come from who wanted to eliminate daylight saving time in California\n[noise] this is from the state assembly member sponsored by a state assembly member in\nSan jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents um it was his dentist actually who showed him medical studies that link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spring to increased stroke traffic accidents and heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to ... clock changes\nThere's pretty good data that that loss of sleep it throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented them and I'm puts them at higher risk of all of those things\nSo it's not just that we're grumpier there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for prop seven like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why uh pops up and wants to be a at the white white folks are pushing props up [noise]\nYeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice to switch clocks so there's some popular support for keeping the clock steady or around also when we are using daylight savings time we have that more light in the evening\nAnd there is some economic benefit because ah ends and public health benefit because people are exercising their out eating at restaurants they're playing sports they're walking their dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place can\nUs [noise] yeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time\nYeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time I was in the late Seventeen hundreds he was living in France he was the American ambassador to Paris and it was his habits just leap a\nTo work late late into the evening riding by candlelight until three or four in the morning and then he would sleep until about noon\nAnd one morning he got woken up by this loud sound at six AM and realize oh the sun's up I could be could be using the sunlight to write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles um but it wasn't until World War one\nThat it was really adopted by countries it was a Germany\nThe was the first country to Institute it and then I'm all of the countries that were involved in the war effort\nAdopted daylight saving time to save energy and it did use to save some energy it doesn't say much now it seems um it was then made optional between the wars was brought back again in the United states for World War two\nAnd in California voters um voted to Institute that the daylight savings time schedule that we have now are in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switch to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil prices can you tell us what happened then\n[noise] yeah I'm President Nixon ordered year round daylight savings time for two years to save to save energy\nDuring the OPEC oil embargo but it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold very dark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress and did the experiment I'm a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um\nI'm a year early now I'm Wondering about you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um those of us in the north and maybe hurts those of us in the south who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator but the shift of light versus dark is of course much more drastic in the northern latitudes [noise] you know on the equator we have twelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light\nSo so here for instance in California if this proposition passed and California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in the in the shortest days of the year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state that would it wouldn't rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners for what they thought about this idea and there were lots of folks who supported it as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California voter\nHello I'm Alexis from Los Angeles California and and it's pointless measure that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness\nEducation pathway for immigration prisoner farmed list is endless even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take I have no\nDidn't how we've just got up and coming up on the end of the segment here but it's not an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to

U.S and China and not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nThere contesting America's geopolitical advantages been trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the blog one column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nIt doesn't have to be an China is extremely keen that it should not be they don't even want to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one and work out what America wants\nBought it used to be just a few hard line is here in Beijing who thought that America actually couldn't be negotiating with\nBut it used to be just a few hardliners here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiating with that America wanted to contain China and still China's rise\nThat fringe of hard line is is not spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints\nThey look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade will and they're starting to wonder whether that was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great superpower or the top of the sudden economic Tyson poll America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has two sides to try and stop them and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful and this has come out of out of the blue and\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of the dishes like intellectual property right but Trump pulled out of it\nA try I mean there was a a a a retard very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was all off the record so I Can't say the name but he was a kind of household name in his day and he comes to ... for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about China went understood in\nDC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there's something to this that\nThe problem is that the machine and Washington has kind of systematic structural things but it wants China to do differently to play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say ... to ...\nJust domestic structural things but it wants China to do differently\nTo play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco to you know to what was something like the ... everyone opens their markets that bull Donald Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think\nIf you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if\nYou know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent\nTo the rest of the world access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states and it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table but there isn't gonna biggest structural\nKind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you pay the low we'll rent I I think that's the core of what Donald Trump is up to right now what is China's vision for the world\nSo he was a really interesting saying the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and basically being gaming the system ever since\nUh China China is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know broadly that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nTo go how they get that\nNot actually so important that quite opportunistic if one ... they'll try another if there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of ...\nThat's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries\nAnd and for a long time they were gaming the world trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months ago trade tensions and you get this when you talk to the European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing it turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike\nMore than an American led worlds trading older is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gaming the rules playing the system so then they realized that the one thing they do want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are\nQuite in the winter of reforming the WTO no longer kind of changing so much so there is all this kind of there's all these moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive\n... the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction\nOr an absolutely confident the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because reasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down to listen to people who can explain Washington and they got ... down the list there are people like me and I literally have conversations with them when I say I'm opposed to it's not my job to tell you\nYou know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese said so she says this\nAn ancient Greek historian who rose about when you had a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably lead to war and so he's been analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where the status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart\nAnd in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you can\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart\nAnd in a depressing number of cases that does trigger armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stop this thing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of the phone from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person these kind of man and killed some time to kind of New York real estate guy\nUm so I think as people age to go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries that no longer think that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big\nThat it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and ... there was this extraordinary things on the Trump said I think it was the U.N General assembly speech\nWhen he said the previous presidents have been ready to watch trying to rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so soon that's really extraordinary statement you know previous American presidents said\nYou know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of a member of the great from the good a hoagie international older along with everyone else but for Donald Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric\nLeast as a piece of rhetoric you're just not going to grow rice and the way that you thought you were going to I'm going to stop it that that is an incredibly bleak thing for Beijing to hit\nThis was a concern all around the globe right now like in Brazil we've been reporting on the heated presidential election runoff in Brazil this weekend\nRight wing candidate shy or both in our was facing off against left his opponent Fernando ... died this information and fake news have been huge issues in that race a lot of it is playing out on the messaging platform what's up\nWhich we should note is owned by Facebook user Dara ... is a Brazilian researcher now in Boston starting all this at Harvard joined sting center she's also invoked\nNote is owned by Facebook user Daraa quarter of a is a Brazilian researcher now in Boston starting all this at Harvard showing student center she's also involved in an effort called ... over a collaboration between twenty five Brazilian newsrooms to identify and debunk fake news\nQuarter of a tells me that the fake stories she's seeing on what's up are out of control\nWe make fun actually because the the misinformation campaigns in Brazil they sometimes can get absurd in what way or the or support in in the reefs and fears that are totally\nKnown since like\nVenezuela I supported by Hezbollah or stuff like this\nAnd I was coming here and I had a discussion with a friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the right wing candidate was the antidote to but you know becoming of Venezuela supported by Hezbollah\nSo ... was a teacher Brazilians she's ...\nShe's president and she probably heard this thing's via watch that\nAnd I I started to last and it was like yeah you know what listen here's the website of control over this is ally this this this is nonsense please you're a teacher at Harvard [laughter] but people believe this thing's\nSo is that one of the rumors that Hezbollah connection with Venezuela is that one of the members of spreading on what's happened Brazil\nYes this is bringing you this is fresh room or [laughter]\nThan there are the older still remembers making a comeback of Brazil's president ... seats up\nFor example we had a real more about the last candidate being the creator of something called ... which is supposed to be an educational heat to teach kids how to be ...\nBeing the creator of something called ... which is supposed to be an indication oak heat to teach kids how to be gay\nWhile [laughter] the the implication being if you vote for the left wing candidate you're going to have gay kids in\nSchools and there will be connections with the government\nOf Venezuela and Hezbollah the same time I see what you're saying by absurd um just to be clear what definitive links have there been between these disinformation campaigns and either political candidate like the charge enjoyable scenario launched this yeah that'll legitimate claim\nThis is a rule more from two thousand twelve inches to up in the website of the right wing candidate\nHe created this a false information he was a a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to the Congress and several Congress ... percent that are religious they supported him in this story and this became older\nBoth in our was also accused of creating another monster a big one last week a Brazilian a newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firms to buy a bundle of phone numbers\nAnd use them to mask text propaganda to Brazilians through what's up Brazilian authorities are investigating those claims in the meantime people like you as a direct quarter of a are trying to put out the flames before they turn into a fake news wildfire in Brazil\nWas very interesting is that as far as I've seen of watch the news in this information\nThere is no story that is not in both platforms Facebook and watch that and what we see different types of presentations so what do you have an all you see like there's this thing happening you have to\nA different types of presentations\nSo when ... you have an all you see like there's this thing happening you have to act\nSo there's a call to action that's very strong shared this otherwise our country is going to be a Venezuelan five years share this to save our country stuff like this\nOn Facebook you have the same narrative is the same narrative but Facebook is more sophisticated the have videos have text specialist opinions all the things that make\nPeople believe to court I studied disadvantaged there's an entire system if you look just to watch that uh we're not getting all the picture\nI mean ... I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have a a social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake news and what what are those cars I think we have a huge inequality in poor people are left behind him in so many things including education\nWe have a level of instability that was provoked biting peach mint\nOf Duma that make people don't ... the former president ... yeah uh that make ... made people believing in and they don't believe in these tuitions anymore neither the government or the newspapers\nOr I don't know there is no institutions that they would believe right now and um this is also very important when you study fake news because people tend to believe\nIn the misinformation campaigns\nThis is also very important when you study fake news because people tend to believe in the misinformation contains instead of leaving the institutions are newsrooms\nThat was a dark quarter of a on how fake news is playing out of Brazil's presidential election quarter of a studies this information out of Harvard shore unseen center she's also involved with ... a collaboration with Brazilian newsrooms and social media companies to take fake stories off their platforms\nThe runoff election in Brazil by the way takes place this Sunday\nOr [noise] [noise]\n\nThere's a very well preserved shipwreck lying at the bottom of the black sea off the coast of Bulgaria it is so old how old is it it may date back to a time when Aristotle was alive hard to believe\nThis rock was found by a team of researchers using a remote controlled submarine they found more than sixty shipwrecks in total deep and the black sea including this one Seventy five foot Greek trading vessel which they estimate has been lying under water for the past two thousand four hundred years\nWhich they say might make this the oldest intact shipwreck ever discovered\nProfessor John Adams was the principal investigator for the black sea maritime archeology project\nThe next stop and think about this he says he's he's actually completed\nAnd when I say completes the most is still standing the super structure is that the reading benches are still across the hall both Roosevelt with a list of attached it looks very much like some of the crop to fix his own a theme in fifth century bc vases I never thought I'd see anything like that in my life\nSeveral members of the team have also noted the ship bears a striking resemblance to the one on the ... of the British Museum on that involves you see an image of a ... strapped to the mast as his ship sails past three sirens marine archaeologist Dr Helen far\nAnd that bothers you see an image of a ... year strapped to the mast as his ship sails past three sirens marine archaeologist Dr Helen far says this discovery could help historians connect some dots\nAbout travel in the classical world\nWe have three and four in the vaccine you've got the sense that lots of land and take action within that training as well we need that because at the time to do what we didn't have with the shape pranks say this really hills and I think\nIt's unlikely that the ship will ever be displayed on land the reason the shipwreck has remained in such good condition for so long is the water it's been submerged in for centuries the black sea is and knock sick or free of oxygen and more than a mile below the surface there's not much marine life to disturb the wreck here's professor Adams again\n... looks they puff it to us\nThere's very little physical strength left in between those two thousand four hundred years has long time there are bacteria would work inside the souls of the woods and they're still actually actively even offer this time\nOf the century that means the ... has a new mechanical strength so you'd have to lift it piece by piece and even then it would be very very difficult so I think we all technology that we have available to us now we can record is in such detail\nWithout even touching that is probably federal where it is\nOther fined by the black sea maritime archeology project include Roman trading vessels and seventeenth century ... rating fleet a two hour film about the discovery was shown at the British Museum in London yesterday\n\n\n\nStill ahead Egypt and singer dean at all with Dee Dee tells me about the fan boys at our shows in Cairo\nYou're listening to South Carolina public radio\nThis program is made possible through membership support\nAnd the Columbia museum of art presenting the ... chamber music on main between new artistic director Andrew Armstrong Tuesday October thirtieth at seven pm with selections from Schubert for re invesco and Brahms information at Columbia museum dot org", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Columbia", "day": "24"}
