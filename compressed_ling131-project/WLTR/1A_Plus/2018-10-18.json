fans when he gave up that home run during Tuesday's close game the Astros are currently down three to one against the Boston Red Sox and the American league championship series\nBut as soon as it plays on the team has also been question for reasons unrelated to his pitching since he joined the Astros last August in June major league baseball suspended as soon as Seventy five games for violating the league's domestic violence policy and while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays\nThan the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area Whitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney\nAbsolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public right now about the sooner or a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may uh in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case then a a police report was filed but because it was in Canada\nI think they're just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably know some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended\nAnd eventually just about a over a month ago the criminal case was wrapped up with a piece bond which is about approximately\nUh and eventually just about a over a month ago\nThe criminal case was wrapped up with a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a restraining order situation in the U.S he has a year of probation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico\nDid not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of connection um\nSo that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh\nYeah the the details are just a little fuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way\nSo let's talk a little bit about ... a current domestic violence policy like what is it it's only been around for a couple of years um but it's led to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna\nYes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen\nI'm there have been a handful of investigations and suspensions to this point and no sooner was a the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant a suspension it was the third or fourth one this year actually I'm most recently Addison Russell of the cubs was suspended forty games\nFor a domestic abuse so uh they're having players offended before and after roe soon as he is not the first but again his situation is very specific because\nThere was a trade that was involved um\nBut MLD doesn't necessarily um similar to other sports and if they do not necessarily wait until a criminal case has been completed they do their own investigation they speak to victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account\nUm an overall the process it a little bit a kind of like a famous case it's a little bit um non transparent we don't have a ton of information about why Obama was Seventy five games as Russell was\nKind of like a famous case it's a little bit um non transparent we don't have a ton of information about why Obama was Seventy five games as Russell was forty or a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past few years we don't really know what ... investigation\n... um so it's a little tough and it does make it uh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in the Senate case you were saying\nHe's the third highest number of games he must have done something awful but we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky um and players under the\nSuspended under the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players suspended for steroids or performance enhancing drugs which are\nNot eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a\nTricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms there are some issues of transparency as far as how their investigation go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as they like it to\nThe Astros decided to trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I guess the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there are people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that as soon to actually make the team stronger what do you make of\nThat yeah I think it's a ... the way I've seen the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs\nDid this with our oldest Chapman a star closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago and it did win the world series and it worked and fans kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it with those tuna um the ... been a little bit more\nAnd it worked and fans kind of had to come to terms with whether that was worth it with those tuna um the ... been a little bit more blatant about that is what we're doing um you know he ... he throws good pitches he's gonna win he could win at the world series when\n... what's interesting about this story is that the Astros now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that\nPurely for the optics of ... having gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR spin Jim ... owner of the Astros did openly admit kind of\nWe now that we've created for us you know we want to make sure that domestic violence awareness is a ... in an important thing for the Astros foundation which has a thirty million dollar and down in um so he and he kind of fed the quiet part out loud we traded for domestic abuser\nNow we'd like to do the work in the community that hope hopefully makes us feel better about that it feels like they're trying to have it both ways it it does um the players have been saying oh he's a great clubhouse presence you know ... flew an H
