he was three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year in today's dollars from his father's wealth and real estate empire by the time he was eight he was a millionaire and total the president receive four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\nThat's according to a scathing investigation by the New York times one of the longest peace is ever published by the paper the investigation was based on more than one hundred thousand pages of documents charted the financial history of the Trump family business and the extent to which Donald Trump profited off of the transfer of wealth from his father Fred Trump\nThe report detailed signs of tax evasion and very likely tax fraud involving sham corporations undervalued real estate holdings in schemes to avoid inheritance taxes\nIn total one billion that's billion with a beat dollars in wealth was transferred from the Trump parents to the Trump children instead of paying fifty five percent of tax on those funds the times investigation found that Trump's pay just five percent tax that's basically the equivalent of about five hundred million dollars in taxes that went unpaid\nJenny Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johns and more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud\nThere certainly parts of this that are fraud there are parts of it that are um tax avoidance or tax minimization that is perfectly well within the confines of the law and then there are parts of that but you know very significantly cross the line\nAnd we of course should mention that the president's lawyer told the New York times that the allegation of tax fraud innovations were quote one hundred percent false and highly defamatory um despite that the times found two hundred and ...\nThe allegation of tax fraud innovations work quote one hundred percent false and highly defamatory um despite that the times found two hundred and Ninety five distinct streams of revenue created by Fred Trump to help transfer this money to his son Donald Trump\nWhich is quite frankly I'm a pretty incredible and one of the ways that they did that was by creating a company called all county building supply and maintenance and they use that company to supposedly by things like cleaning supplies\nBut into times investigation they found that basically it was a shell company with the company on paper and they would mark up the cost of products as a way of transferring the money is on tax gifts is that tax fraud I Believe\nThat it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true\nAnd one of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS and this company had no economic substance it was merely a way of funneling gifts from the president's father or to the president has siblings one\nOf the other things we mentioned at the top is that the uh the trumps also undervalued they're real estate properties\nAnd according to this investigation and the New York times Fred Trump's\nNineteen Ninety five gift tax return he claimed that twenty five apartment complexes he owned were valued at forty one point four million but the New York times says the bank value was actually near nine hundred million what about that is it clear that that's tax fraud\nIt's not as clear um because you need to understand the way that valuations occur and the kinds of discounting that is is actually appropriate and in normal when looking at a minority interest in a company so you you start with a value and if\nAnd in normal when looking at a minority interest in a company\nSo you start with a value and if if that value is wrong then everything following it is wrong and in this case it looks like that value was probably wrong but it's not as clear cut because we we don't have the competing evaluations\nDone by another expert as of the same approximate date we're looking at\nThings that happened years after and things do change over the course of time I would say that that does valuations are highly likely to be wrong but whether it up and and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nI guess the question that this is sort of all coming from our tax code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn our listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier\nFamilies in wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\nYeah I\nWealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need to be you know I think an important thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in now this year if when you die you have more than eleven million dollars\nSo it's not like these people are avoiding attack state is generally applicable to the rest of the population like when they are avoiding income tax and other people are paying their fair share of income tax\nIn a state tax you know it's I it's a creation of Congress that only applies to the wealthy and then there are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay a and if you follow the rules um then you're abiding by the law\nThere are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay a and if you follow the rules um then you're abiding by the law the problem here is that the rules were not really followed\nIt feels like they weren't followed but it also I think for a lot of Americans I think there's a sense of frustration among those of us who pay our taxes and don't you know find these loopholes and and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who kind of seemed to be able to get around this\nI think that's more of a valid complaint with income tax with a state tax none of the rest of us pay estate tax the wealthy pay in state tax yes significant portions of it and you know sometimes they can minimize the amount that they have to pay\n... and what is that what you know is that normal behavior of the ultra wealthy in this country\nMinimizing the amount of state taxes absolutely normal behavior committing fraud to do it is not normal behavior or how do we distinguish the two you have to look at the amounts and whether the violation of allies willful\nAnd you know the IRS as a whole set of penalties that that they used to apply based on how undervalued the properties we're in the estate tax returns\nJamie Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago Danny thanks for being with the

[noise]\nAfter about three years the statistics show that about half people and a half the people coming out will return to custody and what\nIs is there a driving force for that recidivism\nIt's a lot of different things it's not just to return to criminal a return to a criminal behavior\nIs in the study I was doing in Boston talking to people coming out of the state prison in Massachusetts the biggest predictor of for a return to custody was relapse to addiction that took many different phone sometimes people would committing crimes to support their habits or\nSometimes they were in the middle of the bender and getting in fights and other conflicts or sometimes they were violating the condition to their parole and filing a drug test and uh so ... a a big piece of this I think is a honestly a public health crisis uh among people with a struggling with addiction\nAnd you know our producer Alexandra without at a meeting with men who had come out of prison after many many many years and there is this recurring theme of fear of going back\nDo you find that in your research that that there is a fear that these these folks who are coming out of prison are very aware of their own likelihood of relapse thing or\nAre going back yeah yeah and I think part of that is the ah ease the stress of incarceration that people often reported to us and and people who was struggling with addiction own mental health problems\nFound prison very a very stressful on the outside uh I think ... people were exhibiting symptoms of post traumatic stress and when people express ...\nThe outside uh I think ... people were exhibiting symptoms of post traumatic stress and when people express fear about going back the post traumatic stress they're experiencing is a significant part of that the uh\nWhat exactly then are we measuring when we analyze recidivism in the United states that is a great question in many ... that I I think it's the key question in a lot of ways because overwhelmingly\nFocused on recidivism but I think we know that a part of that is due to five years without a health system for people who are in\nA poll health of a lot of people coming out or on parole and an parolees dice is really is the violence bureaucracy\nAnd to a as it goes to a rehabilitative process exactly and\nYou know historically parole was conceived to help people returned to society find their place in the community uh after incarceration\nIt's really become very much a law enforcement function it's a ... a parole officers spend a lot of their time monitoring compliance with the conditions of a community release and are filing a drug test missing appointments or can lend you back in prison\n[noise] you have a different way of looking at risk that have visit these distance [noise] yeah and it shows what that is [laughter] criminologists talk about\nRecidivism offending again a off the you've committed crime or after you've been released from prison\nThey also talk about the ... and the system means permanently refraining from crime and I think the focus on the ... shifts how we think about\nLee refraining from crime and I think the focus on the ... shifts how we think about the response to the problem of crime are and how we should think about people who are returning home after incarceration\nAnd the objective when we focus on distance is his socially integrate people back into communities try and fun to help them find a place for them in the families in the labor market in the neighborhoods in which they leave\nIt's a problem of recidivism Texas perspective of society what ... might someone returning home from prison caused to the rest of us\nThe prospective on assistance asks how can we find a place in society a for someone who is being separated from it costs are action a lot of the answers to the problem of reentry\nEnd up going to be found with criminal justice authorities they're going to be found outside of the criminal justice system with the department of health and housing\nAnd education and in the resources of communities I think there's an appetite for that conversation ... there's a growing understanding that this
