ago there was a real bust student movement that began in the spring of Nineteen sixty eight\nWith students from universities all over the city and eventually all over the country pouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedoms for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting and powerful kind of civic movement that really had no precedent in Mexico\nAnd that a movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall of the movement grew in strength and that demands became sharper and more articulated\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students with the terrible shootout and massacre that took place during a protest meeting\nIn the public square at ... in Mexico city on October second when dozens of students

themselves had been firing from\nThe building overlooking the square to simply wasn't true was ally and what actually happened which we discovered slowly over the years that in fact the president had placed snipers in those buildings that overlooks the square where we're at ten thousand students and other people were gathered to protest\nAnd that they had fired down into the crowd in order to create a kind of chaos which would then permit the military to move in and arrest hundreds of people which is in fact what happened\nEarly in September of this year we saw major student demonstrations in Mexico city and I'm Wondering when you see\nYou know students and young people getting very much political these days do you think back to what happened fifty years ago are you seeing similarities there in between what happens in Mexico today versus fifty years ago [noise] sure\nBut I don't think students are pouring into the streets because of what happened five decades ago I think they are pouring into the streets because of violence and impunity uh from the government today I think they are pouring into the streets because four years ago almost to the day\nForty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get it at the state of NATO\nAnd disappeared and have never shown up and the government has done nothing\nWhat happened fifty years ago are

students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government\nAnd in fact the Mexicans just voted in a person to be president um Lopez Obrador who does not represent neither the ruling party nor even the sort of\nDominant opposition parties but a new party that he has found that so there is a kind of a ... a resurgence let's say\nOf hope for change NF demand for an end to the kind of a huge less violence that has been going on in Mexico for much too long\nAnd last week a commission from the Mexican government recognized the massacre as a state crime in your opinion you've done a ton of research on this is is sufficient and is it a step towards justice\nIt really is and the government can emission that recognize that is is a new and important commission that is was set up by the current government opinion yet though to provide support and attention to victims of violence\nThat is not a government recognition of state responsibility for the crimes of local

I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what's happened over the last year it's been almost a year since um the Harvey Weinstein allegations came out\nAnd there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of our society and we start talking about what consent looks like for ourselves in our daily lives and our insect flies in and day thing\nWhat is consent how is it being defined today and has that definition evolved\nA word you can also question I still do it is essentially an agreement between normally to people as to whether we move forward with sex or not but it is incredibly difficult to define which is one of the things we found out in the fees and how you get to the point of consent\nIs constantly up for debate one of the things that we explored in this piece with a ... you know needing to have a solid yes before you move forward with any kind of um sexual interaction\nAnd that on the face of it it's great because I Would just did spell any kind of confusion around this topic but when we actually think about it you know needing to have a yes when you strip someone's\nHand when you kiss someone not always seen as very sexy but maybe that's a problem with our society and a norms of what sexy and ... months or so maybe we need to start redefining them\nAnd then the question becomes well part of the question in this film is what can be gained by talking to the people who have hurt you and I think that's a really delicate\nPlace to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nThink that it suddenly depends on your situation how that trauma has manifested itself\nMaybe that's a problem with our society and a ... for sexy and very month is maybe we need to start redefining them\nAnd then the question becomes well part of the question in this film is what can be gained by talking to the people who have hurt you and I think that's a really delicate\nPlace to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nI think that it depends on your own situation how about trauma has manifested itself and how you feel about that particular scenario paying out\nWhat we tracked in this documentary is a case of two adults who ten years ago had sex one person who thought consensual sex a drunken incident one person who got rape and they sat down and had a face to face conversation\nI told myself I was in training and that the things I thought I ... just to name a real life really not not wanting to face the next level of this line of questioning\nTheir

started you with us but\nIt's interesting because at this time when we're talking about ... accounts have been as he looks like I mean we really don't have a lot of options for how to handle situations so often happens years ago or even decades ago um and said this is one option to face it with conversation and dialogue isn't\nThere I mean I Would also say it's a pretty dangerous way to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own called the person or I just\nKnow set something up a lot of feeling yeah definitely um and as I said it's definitely not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend doing without seeking professional advice to um [noise] yeah I mean that's a ... it's a very controversial technique it can cause ... station\nUm it can be seen as a too soft and approach but some people I mean some people do deserve to go through this\nWay to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own call the person or I just\nI Know said something that ... up a lot of feeling yeah definitely and and I thought that is definitely not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend doing without seeking professional advice as to um [noise] yeah I mean that's a ... it's a very controversial technique it can cause ... and\nUm it can be seen as a too soft and approach but some people I mean some people do deserve to go through the criminal justice system this is just an alternative option that I wasn't aware of before making this documentary in that we wanted to bring to the table as a possibility for some people\nIs there any other way that people should be thinking about getting to that level of reconciliation without a face to face meeting and I think we often talk about forgiveness in a way that that's the end goal but is it [noise]\nNo I mean and and those were stars of justice sessions I should say that the end goal is not necessarily forgiveness um the majority of justice sessions allow the survivors to be in the driver's seat and so it's up to them whether they forgive or not or whether they want more sessions or whether they want to continue the conversation or whether they want to just\nLet it go there are obviously many different ways in which individuals find healing and find closure and this is definitely not a building and all the solutions to every one I Would say that there are limited options because you know as we all know the criminal justice system is\nOften fails us in when we want to handle these situations and six out of a thousand cases of sexual assault go without convictions and so we have very limited options but this is just one of the ones that we tried to showcase hair\nAnd at the beginning of the film you mentioned your own experience um that you said falls into the sort
