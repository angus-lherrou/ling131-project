government he had served in the government you become a spokesman for some senior officials so for us we knew him that way\nAnd then lately she'd taken up a poster with the Washington Post or the global columnist\nAnd moved away from Saudi Arabia and basically set up and self imposed exile in his in his criticism had increased so he was a real ... in the side as we see clearly now with his fate\nAnd you've been speaking to sources within the Turkish government Carlotto what are the new developments here\nWe've been following this day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the the the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and they talked early on of his possible death um\nAnd now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got\nPriests so he was a real ... and the side as we see clearly now with his fate\nAnd you've been speaking to sources within the Turkish government Carlotto what are the new developments here\nSo we've been following this day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the that the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and they talked early on of his possible death um\nAnd now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very from signs from Turkish officials\nThey don't want to come out in public that clearly giving it to John honest to publish that those two groups of Saudis that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn to the second over a week ago and\nThese officials that came flew in on private planes and left the same day I'm sort of Saudi officials are Turkish officials Saudi officials Fifteen of them want to separate plans they came in\nIn in a different times that day and they left the same day and the ... officials are saying they are essentially a hit squad they were responsible for killing him this membrane his body and somehow disposing of it so the the mystery remains the investigation the types of now\nMounted an investigation they're asking access to the consulate which of course is diplomatic ... trees so that said uh also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid details in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about

investigation they're asking access to the consulate which of course is diplomatic ... trees so that said uh also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid details in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nThe details all gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among their equipment\nKnow they took several books is an suitcases out of the embassy or consulate building put them in the cold [noise]\nUm we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details on those even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the premises often with\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all in the United states obviously has close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play and the talks I think have been keen to get international support on this because\nI'm everyone knows Saudi Arabia is a very powerful and rich nation especially in the Muslim world and so everybody has been looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based\nHas been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from\nSo far so at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play\nAnd the talks I think have been keen to get international support on this because I'm everyone knows Saudi Arabia is a very powerful to enrich nation especially in the Muslim world on so everybody's been looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based\nHas been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from President Trump but also from vice president Pence and I think\nImportantly a more and more comments coming out of from congressman and senator so the American I think sided waking up and taking this more seriously as the information is coming out and it's becoming more and more clear what happened\nThis is a moment in which the United states has made you know at least the president has pulls no punches in his day and I think for many I'm In the press and not\nAttack on press freedoms has actually I think extended worldwide we've seen a number of journalists killed in Mexico we've seen a number of journalists killed\nIn the ear you recently how do we know who we can trust with these stories Carlotta are there any of the actors involved in this cause Yogi story that you feel are telling the truth or not telling the truth um it just feels really difficult with these types of pieces to understand where to look\n[noise] um it it is difficult and not least in Turkey well known any you know the president of the usa criticized John this but the president of turkey

like me working here\nUm but this is a completely different league from you know complaining about the press or banning pressed from working or even share as journalists I'll put in prison [noise]\nThis is altogether different league because it's not only an act against a journalist who was clearly\nA disliked by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his criticisms but to dispose of him breaking international law I'm In another country\nAlso be disposing of him in the country or take him out of the country has its complete ... I'm a different league of of what we have seen from coming from the U.S president on on the touch president so it's also very shocked the talks here both in government on in society\nI think the government or radio pool because they knew ... while he was he counted among his friends people who are senior advisors and the government\nUm he had a great reputation because he'd been reporting society is on Middle East and Muslim effect as an so he was\nHe was well known and well respected an for him to end up like this is is a poor linked to a country that considered him a Muslim brother and new pride themselves on the the hospitality and openness to guest so it's ... people across the\nCarlotta Gall is he has stumbled bureau chief for the New York times\nAmong his friends people who are senior advisors and the government\nUm he had a great reputation because he'd been reporting for such he is on Middle East and Muslim affairs and so he was\nHe was well known and well respected him for him to end up like this is a polling to a country that considered him a Muslim brother new pride themselves on the the hospitality opener to get so it's short people across the board\nCaught a lot of college he has stumbled bureau chief for the New York times ... thank you very much and thank you\nWe want you to be part of the takeaways less and our response network\nWill send you a few text messages a week about topics were discussing on our show\nTo sign up just ... start to sex nine eight ...\nStandard data messaging right supply and you can always ... shop to opt out again start six Ninety eight six six to join our conversation every day you can also connecting us on Facebook Twitter and\nThis is Walter ...
