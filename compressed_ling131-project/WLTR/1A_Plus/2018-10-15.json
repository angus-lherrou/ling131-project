Turkey and hasn't been seen since\nAccording to reports Saudi officials allegedly tortured and murdered and may have even dismembered the Washington Post columnist claims which the Saudi state strongly denies on friday reports emerged that Turkish authorities have audio and video recordings confirming that could show he was killed inside the Saudi consulate\nThose recordings have not yet been made public but now Saudi Arabia says Turkish officials concerts there consulate meanwhile US Senators are pushing the Trump Administration to consider sanctions on the Saudi Government and

having me on\nSo if the Saudis have denied any involvement in the disappearance of ... and I'm so far that's been absent any proof as far as we know\nA there was just a breaking news alerts that they are now allowing Turkish investigators into the consulate what's your sense on what's that could mean yeah\nThat certainly an interesting development however really remains to be seen how cooperative as Saudi officials may be and we have had 'em out that officials allowed on the premise is once\nBefore but it was very tightly controlled sort of more of a curated sewer than an investigation keep in mind that the Saudis have had almost two weeks to\nMake whatever preparations they might mean to in order to ensure that the ... investigation um wouldn't go favorably for them so it's\nIn order to ensure that this investigation um we'd go favorably for them so it's perhaps a positive development by you know we should be definitely be skeptical whatever may arise from that visit\nSo of course

give you an example they ordering military equipment everybody in the world one of the bed order\nRussia want her to China wanted if we wanted to we got it and we go to all of it every bit of\nThe question I have for you is what kind of punishment are we talking about he's sort of talked around sanctions are sanctions still on the table\nIs definitely a matter of debate at this precise moment we've had some members of Congress saying that they would\nWant to go that far you know for the U.S that has such a strong and longstanding economic relationship with Saudi Arabia sanctions are treated sort of as the ultimate boundary of of the possible it's it's a red line for some people who\nTend to want it to focus on a more incremental perhaps more cultural soft reprimand towards the Saudi Government whereas others\nSay that that is the only really effective way and the only way to really convey a level of severity that they see in this case so I think on what everyone's really watching as the the threat that Saturday issued in response to some of these hands on which is threatening to raise the oil price is threatening to retaliate\nThe threat that Saudi issued in response to some of these hands on which is threatening to raise the oil price is threatening to\nRetaliate um as far as their oil production goes so we'll we'll have to see 'em what risks our government is actually willing to take but oil on weapons sales are certainly are you know the meat and potatoes the foundation of our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nAnd you did speak with Jamal earlier this year

are being asked to sign loyalty pledges\nHe was receiving increasing pressure from the government and um he grew really disheartened with the regime he loved Saudi Arabia\nHe really expressed a lot of regret that he had felt the need to leave his family and his job and many many colleagues a Heinz but he told me you know Saudi Arabia deserves better and this ...\nMain market um one thing may market

policies discriminate against Asian American applicants spearheading the lawsuit is a conservative activist named Edward Blum was organized efforts to end affirmative action before here's how he describes the problem\nIt's Russia discrimination and it's a quota for the quarter today's against Asians much likes quarterback in the Nineteen twenties and thirties was against Jews and the issues

community we spoke to a couple of students\nMy name is Ken issue I'm a senior at Davidson College another writer for the federalist I'm an Asian American but to me you know the critical part of that is not an American and I think that I Want to be looked at it on the basis of Michael issues and all the content of my character\nRather than the way that harbors which Asian Americans reading them for personality I'm reading the people that are less desirable college strictly because they're raised\nMy name is Sally ten I'm a current senior at Harvard College studying history and literature and studies of women's gender and sexuality and Americans are being used as a\nRacial wedge in a lot of ways either way of propping up against other people of color and utilizing the quote unquote model minority net to perpetuate these ideas about who deserves to be in these institutions\nPersonally for equal treatment of all races regardless of your race or ethnicity I think that people should be treated on the basis of merit and opportunity I think that\nUm anytime cause such a different\nKind of racial balancing positions thing by necessity usually involves turning away from people who were more merited and taking and people who are less qualified\nI truly believe that my admissions file my application\nCould not have been as compelling as it ended up being for by admissions officer had I not been able to talk about my race in our really meaningful way along with my other identities as a child of immigrants as a first generation college student at someone who comes from a low income family it done and justice to\nAll students including Asian Americans to try to portray us as if they are\nWho comes from a low income family it doesn't injustice to all students including Asian Americans to try to portray us as if you are a monolith\nI grew up around ... New Jersey area so there are a lot of people there were very academic and very obsessed with college and so I think that when when you have that kind of environment it really doesn't help\nWhen school at Harvard basically says you a drought because she's not worth as much as another guy's a fish because it looks like you're trying to court because it seems like you're not worthy some characteristics that you know we can't change better so\nI don't think there's a person on the campus can deny that they have benefited\nFrom having a diverse student body in a diverse campus I think that in fact the conversation has evolved to actually be\nMore about how Harvard it'd be doing more for it's good\nTo do better recruiting get diversity within diversity thinking about Asian Americans as being comprised of multiple ethnic groups including south east Asian than in more recent immigrants and Pacific Islanders\nJoining me now to discuss the lawsuit against Harvard is Natasha worry

shoot staff writer for the New Yorker well thanks for being are still to be here so Natasha let's start with you or you're currently at Harvard University which is being sued in this case are you involved in this lawsuit in any way no I'm not\nTo tell us a little bit about how Harvard's policy admissions work where does race factor in if it factors in at\nAll [noise] so how has a holistic admissions policy which means that the admissions office upset a whole host of factors when deciding\nWhich means that the admissions office upset a whole host of factors when deciding whether to admit students\nUm this includes of course academics but in addition to academics it's also looking at particularly um talents that a student might have outside of the academics like\nMusical talent perhaps someone has done some pretty serious science research they are also looking at athletics and you know manning the sports teams\nI'm of course the legacy that are part of this and race is one of these factors particularly under represented groups African American Latin Latino Native American groups I'm a kind of diverse or make sure that those voices are part of the student body on campus to provide a diverse learning environment\nYou mentioned on the under represented groups who did not mention Asian Americans or legacy students that I'm Wondering why that was\nYes children of people who went to Harvard has some kind of affiliation get a kind of closer look they get an extra read and you know they do get a small leg up and uh in terms of Asian Americans university denies that their penalizing Asian Americans\nIn the admissions process and what the point is they're trying to do in this case it's a tie this question of are Asian Americans penalized if these are the whites\nTo our whites penalized visa vi I'm underrepresented minorities I should say under the law there's a compelling state interest to give a boost to underrepresented minorities for this diverse learning environment\nThe Congress is not true between you know when we're comparing Asian Americans to whites and admissions\nWhy when it comes to you because you just wrote a big piece about this in the New Yorker you interviewed several Asian an Asian American activists who actually are in support of the lawsuit can you give us a sense of why they feel that way why they stand there I think\nThere's a lot of division within the Asian community it might not be as great as is often reported but there is a very small very rural\nThey stand there yeah I think there's a lot of division within the Asian American community it might not be as great as has also reported but there is a very small very vocal group within the Chinese American immigrant population that is very much invested in notions of opportunity meritocracy\nAnd you know they often spoke about the American dream in a way that I think a lot of people who've been in America wild don't necessarily sort of see is contractually binding\nAnd it just sort of this perfect storm Edward Blum is really interested in changing the cultural conversation around affirmative action around race consciousness and a lot of these\nPredominantly I Would say middle class I'm fairly kind of well to do single issue Chinese American voters particularly in suburban areas they don't really experience the diversity that a college campus might provide for them\nOr you know they just see this as taking something away from them\nOkay guys hang on a second we've got to take a short break but we'll be right back with
