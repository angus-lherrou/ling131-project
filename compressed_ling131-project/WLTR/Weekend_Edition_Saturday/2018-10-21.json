Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire\nSince the Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region into being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and the un Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion a main fact to be threatened now a there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated in terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero and the story a ironically they have you know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others\nIronically they have you know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending a you know uh this one man jumped on and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price uh from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question ... what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... she's a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis\nThey have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange they need in less than they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe they can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the IMF very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran uh how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for uh the u._s. government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing after in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you on September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico common\nThank you so much thank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of ...\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very asleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this has published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and if it up all these they didn't know anything about whether it was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends these used official Stuart eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all these official they're showing the satellite is not to its ally so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked these students and why they were attacked\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not these about why the ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the ... not just these\nEven more I had reports\nRight every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up all these white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move to both is where they were dressed birth dating insight to the city\nTo be able to take three more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to the station\nThey do do that she

them mhm they they're all ... of that back way to process it from these two buses disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students who are on this plus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult parts of my best\nThe army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is that that a good was just too\nI'm not so these two bosses\nWhat exactly did to process that the army and they said that belief is that ... scene Steve ... before I mean these two bosses would that do versus what the students were traveling from their school to why why so\nWhat I was able to have found is that\nIn these two buses where a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know\nThe students the ... for the army and if the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what this was that really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was able to connect with one drug lord important drug lord I was able to contact with one person that

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests\nThere's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump ... turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the states\nBut if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual\nCandidate state legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble is ...\nThat tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that soon as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave\nThat's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty senses that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nLead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of

Garcia Navarro head of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival over his long used\nSenator Ted Cruz laughter Hispanic nickname his rival down over his long used for\nPlease himself hasn't escaped scrutiny here from preschool now on CNN\nWhat's your name is Raphael you know you go by kid that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for cleaning native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can overuse identity we can\nBring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em to seriously other many political context I'm the most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should uh be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions\nAnd it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best view on on the grounds so you have to\nOr even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best the one on the grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating are costing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way\nAnd that leads down a terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the twenty century they're drawing people together a through making them feel shed hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings with a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a a real concern that identity and and the politics around it it has been weaponized and it certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies so that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably\nYou know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies so that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion and there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground but it's not available to us\nBecause of the people who are most in ... I think that every confession is now coming together but losing losing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah now the question is whether you can do that with ... you go Rodney recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nDemocracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lies that bind me thinking identity thank you very much\nLike you very much America's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to to use\nIn the complete cookbook for young chef NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef as she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nYear old Lucy Gray is wide and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in chief of the ...\nGreat is wide eyed and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in chief\nOf the nation from New Jersey so good to me to wear little excited a very\nLoosely likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself\nThe cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a as she takes out basal Lucy decides to taste it\nSo ... what are the two for\nDiesel [laughter] at\nOne point while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nAll this is one\nToo that's at AT T SP which is the abbreviation for peace though and this is one capital T. that's been and let me ask you something mind at the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yes recall it\nDecoding kitchens because there's so many words and these recipes that you just don't know until you cook too aren't so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment to instructions on how to measure men's and chop this recipe calls for a chopped onion the first and has to be peeled\n[noise] stop [noise] like let's say the cookbook emphasizes safety\nIn the kitchen was burned them demonstrates went shopping the onion\nIt can be hard to make this first Koch so yeah AC on my fingers are like this all bear claw and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally under the knife\nCitizens that safe way to hold a knife\nLike this all ... and that means that my fingers are never\nGoing to get accidentally under the night so this is the safe way to hold a knife and how to anything", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "21"}
