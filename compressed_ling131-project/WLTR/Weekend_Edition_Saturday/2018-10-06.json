Kavanaugh seems to be on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian blushing forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate this did did the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised\nBut also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh um some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then it had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople their base of the issues of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not ... name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contact with the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\nFoot ... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's energy from Christine Blasey Ford a sincere\nA boat that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support ... a judge no the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel\nThousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible [noise] um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a\nJail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n[noise] to\nTrump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the

pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily the head or of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is\nThe extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald ... over the years I've built that I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm President Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing for low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time\nQueens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing for low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an
