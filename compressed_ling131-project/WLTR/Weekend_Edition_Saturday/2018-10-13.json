of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to

to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police or why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worst\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to give progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world in our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June to read from your mother the ... that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOf the things that is I don't want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say\nLayers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I think led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding um [noise]\nAny new eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nRelationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say\nLayers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I thing led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I

women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding um [noise]\nAny new eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and has a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushed my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be OK lead people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that Andrew your life\nMan I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I may from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about an ...\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleeping in a row from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every cent then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in the book\nBecause you were implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I want to go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we\nCan talk about the physical abuse or addiction the gambling uh both as my family is something that we still can't really honest we talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nMother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical
