breath for a moment and take stock are we getting\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and Carolyn conspire is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nOur perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her she says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar lines between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo piece position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election with a hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders\nWe've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacists in the

[noise]\nI mean I Want to turn to you now I'm Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum ...\nHas been in the news is you know I'm you've actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how\nThe way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people absolutely\nYeah so in in one reason study with Renee floors who the physiologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United

to tackle the problem and a boy ... why rock of finding fixes podcast reports how that works\nBack when ... was the police chief of stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said she if you have a heroin problem in their community and I I remember thinking most impossible standard than heroin is in big cities you know with homeless population that's not in rural America\nFor decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened and the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jail and son is\nVery very sick very very sick people because you talk sing from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people prone doubt there you know they're just

become a de facto detox center at any given time around half\nThe inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand with is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural\nDisaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic snow how much county is the ... county in the country to treat it this way for the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous

over the top of that and all in coordination with each other all the same objective which is like sixty\nCoordination life safety what if they used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic\nAnd ran with it now there are thoughts to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center a lot like during the Oso landslide every two weeks representatives from across\nEpidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center a lot like during the Oso landslide\nEvery two weeks representatives from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump the technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group it come straight out of the ms emergency response ...\nWhich is completed\nThey talked through PowerPoint slides I think family kind of the numbers refer to items on there\nTo do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach school is broken down into smaller pieces like distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nThis to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades I or ten is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo if you set an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in in either in any of our lifetimes 'em by breaking it down like you didn't an elephant you just can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with medicine and they actually send teams of police officers and social workers\nTo help addicted homeless people\nIn

weekend edition with special coverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning\nHighly though oh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell what we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told and none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers\nThe names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by of course the next step is funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime well it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine\nHad expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities\nSay the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern rate I mean\nThis is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and\nUm while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil again eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying\nOne of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades yeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nTo the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm for cold drizzly kind of miserable\nRight um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub I'm a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people or\nYou know grappling as they as they do and and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nHave other mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want to save and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happened so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are\n... ah throughout this committee in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here this tragedy that happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nIncredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on which elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene

crime\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that when you\nWalk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened well I think\nIn these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here if it's for too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the love right is shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nI'm In this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives that tells us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about uh\nTells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be

right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front well we expect to say opt\nTo go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces and then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well\nAre there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help\nAre getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise] yeah there was this dramatic shift\nIn twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van he hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nIt's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud\nOne of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud he didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately in in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you spoken with coworkers including one who was in that town yet Deborah\nGr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWith satellite sailor he loves Hitler Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you so much thank you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics weed and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voter though the teen of voters are any racial minority they're presented as a model with black voters\nWhen we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority [noise]\nThey're presented as a model is black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters\nBut when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned\nTheir race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default\nSo I have treated frequently that when we see\nSomething like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in\nFront of that statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about my people\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nUntil really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see why people are voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that they're they're white and it was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why put our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color where you got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago but why voters also hear the racial implications of that\nAnd so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did this\nAre overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things than fit when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "28"}
