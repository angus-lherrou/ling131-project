thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience to the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died recruiting you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than they kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that or was promised a to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president of how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can tap business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in ... in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we\nThe Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them\nOr so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed and in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to\nThose interests but at the very least in in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our Foreign Relations we need to hold off the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo I'd thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can ah find\nWays to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and make clear that the kind of behavior we named top two weeks is unacceptable even colder thank you\nThank you\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut

unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that to the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects a change in no way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nSpecial forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks\nThose have been replaced by just the targets are people\nAnd we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is mhm\nBut you're investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries I see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces or an emcee all veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes

[noise] I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that\nDoing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know [noise] I guess I'm among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether you as individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries\nBut it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are not ...\nA lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short\nRight yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign knows where he just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is against the law ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend right\nIs this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or they're the only ones who've done this or the other countries will try it um are there other Americans other than the ones and our other Americans who believe you've uncovered yeah right\nIs this happening in in theaters around the world I'm

readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Hayden was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production ... party a drug too cold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her\nSister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry\nThank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take\nHighly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nShe drove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lift and such and not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treats\nYou know what you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise] understand there's going to be a service for Modi on Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nThrough song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of\nThat we didn't know and they've also

thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is oldest states' rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the

like I like that I kind of do they keep coming back all season don't they\nWell they do and this is nice revenge for last year this last year because of your your cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that\nThis is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two and of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know that this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season in Boston\nIn Boston that's right and they are they wait exactly yes and a Christian tell her debuted as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards she's also she'll playing in the NBA for domestic Mickey Hammon of course has already and assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nI think it's coming and I think is overdue and I and I I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the and the NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA has been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with\nMy colleague doors work on the broadcast and so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to know yes [laughter]\nI Know and in in that sport it's a big deal in in professional sports in the the male dominated game\nWe do here I Want to know yes [laughter]\nI Know and in in that sport it's a big deal in in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm and Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important in these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's it's going to be good\nWomen's tennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's gonna be a rule change at Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of the six hour final what do you think of the rule change to go to the er about what what are they going to do it it's the ah ... yeah\nAfter after twelve after twelve twelve and they're going to go to a tie break the way that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the ...\nI don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they think it's a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can sort of a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense then the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nA Howard thank you you're in San Francisco uh their commemorating fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you\nWhen the baby of and HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin\nYou when the baby of an HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers deliver to the infant and risk transferring HIV or but the child grows sugar and most likely die\nChild received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV\nThe surgery is your first and could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa we're about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world\nDr Harriet Etheridge is a medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and she was part of a team of doctors who help prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much for having me on your show how's the baby doing\nAnd the baby's doing very very well we are very yeah after the transplant surgery happen now and to see this child alive and thriving under these circumstances with this world famous case is\nObviously enormous the ... and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made will help\nUs understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't hear\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for and live a diner for three times the average and this child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and\nWe were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nSaid and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV what are the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us why ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy when you consider us so they were sick need that to wish from the parents and the ... particularly who was the ... that she could be a Darnah\nAnd we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote send in harm's the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from the very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the life of their child\nGoing through juice in this uh this case the more people know about it will ah contribute something to lifting the stigma they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to hurt so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's\nIt's a multifaceted says I from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in a normal life\nThen that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people\nCan do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma [noise]\nBut this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious Denton HIV stigma", "year":
