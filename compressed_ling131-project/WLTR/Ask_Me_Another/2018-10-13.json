all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really loved being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and were forced to basically fend for yourself\nUh-huh how did you manage [noise] I don't know I mean I'm\nYou know I think I had a very clear I'm\nAt a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present\n'em in our household and so I was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in you know actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who was a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue\nGoing and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that didn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know a figure all everything out and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece\nGrew up very confused but I always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue\nGoing and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that didn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know a figure all everything up and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story ah mostly I\nThought maybe my voice could be an asset you're up in some way because\nEspecially because of the ... the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and on different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and\nThe experience of millions um I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not that we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nIf I Move the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nWho was it was like cats out of the bag and they had to do all this work [laughter]\n\nSo I'm like I'm so tired I'm like oh you're struggling and all he would like nobody wants to give them your job you know unless it was you know some drug dealers girlfriend [noise] um [noise] and and here I Am putting

published\nWho was it was like cats out of the bag and they had to do all this work\n\nSo I was like I'm so tired I'm like oh you're struggling in Hollywood and like nobody wants to give me a job [laughter] you know unless it was you know some drug dealers girlfriend on and and here I Am putting myself in his vision now do all this work on top of this\nWork yeah and it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my family divided and now you not only have this book but you've decided to\nPublish it was being
