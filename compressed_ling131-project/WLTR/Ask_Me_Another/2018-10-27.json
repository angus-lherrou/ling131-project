[noise]\n\nEven welcome thank you for having me so exciting to have you here so let's start from the beginning of your sponge Bob journey yet\nVerify with me where you were and what you were doing when you received the information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants I was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah\nSquare pants I was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah go Vassar the brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a plush sponge Bob Dole your kid that lived on that in that year so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call\nAnd it was a casting director who had just seen the audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer\nAnd they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the title Tina land up project but we think you might be the right shape for it [noise]\n[noise] yeah that hurt I when I heard a little bit but I've gotten over it but you didn't know what they were talking about oh no they\nThey said that the name is cheaper chip and just we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm other guys I got this audition how cool is going to be in and like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob do in the hands I like looked at the doll and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I was like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob [laughter] [noise]\nUm that is a crazy coincidence it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression ... very distinctive\nHigh pitched kind of ... voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right yeah that was like both\nI'm a conscious decision yeah as an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure uh I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me so\nUh I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me so I stayed up you know\nWorking on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice it's pretty important [laughter]\nCool ...\nYes he says you're you were sitting at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and Juliet did\nYou know yeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah and I had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision I can imagine because they were like well you got you know two weeks of this workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I've I've been doing to Shakespeare show since I was a little kid in DC and so that that was something that I always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it\nSo I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious paths\nI Love those Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now\nRight now his moments so this show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics you were jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training\nSticky were jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training is this five years you've been already has shown up on six yeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of those six years\nI I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned a great yeah which are right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um yeah\nAnd yeah when you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gasped yeah I'd say that I can I get thank you to a you know John at the notion yeah my contortion teacher amazing okay\nI was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot and you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it has made you a more optimistic person hopefully we\nTotally yeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privilege of you know being the sponge\nTwo and a half hours it shows a week um when did you first notice this I don't I don't know it's been a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yeah and like at first I was like [noise] no\nUm but yeah I mean like I Do and I I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around everyone people tend to be taken over by the\nOf his friends ended up his community\nIn front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one\nPeople tend to be taken over by their fear and buy their hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and what spongebob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself\nYou know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days\n[noise]\nA alright are you ready for an ask me another challenge yes I Am a fantastic of course you are so even we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you

may be aware as nine eleven minutes long just a little under a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steaks\nThe emotional stakes that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening so pretty early we sat on the idea there was going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right and then the exact version of end of the world's changed a bunch but we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets sponge Bob\nExact version of end of the world's changed a bunch but we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets sponge Bob sponge Bob and his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom or threatened by a volcano that is going to destroy it and people are freaking out they look ...
