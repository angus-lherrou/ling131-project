the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nOf course it will spare

and make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us or on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries can have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum a so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there is some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalize this agreement\nThrough the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum a so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be tariffs for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry among gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's particularly of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the ... under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral looming them that's from North America in our vehicles the biggest concern our members are going to have\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just is it worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral ... that's from North America in our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the administrators cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking with us today\nThank you it's a

here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care of don't believe the press they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before

couldn't find any child in our care for any parent\nHGH asked by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time the H. S. said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general fine that central database\nInspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no risk bans and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nAs the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote da just does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H.

many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail some women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry\n... someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their

most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can ever make we do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on a spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to this call them since it was published this week\n[noise] yeah I've received more than

trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell their father is about the sort of

have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a ... of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in

the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nBeen able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all

details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum or so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in\nThe end of November So on the one hand there won't be tariffs for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry among gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind is ... particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between cat and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to conclude there's this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement\nShrunk your industry for long gone away\nNo they haven't I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S and some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise\nAlmost fifty percent so this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just isn't worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral ... that's from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have is the administrators cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move for the ...\nAnd we'll send a senior vice
