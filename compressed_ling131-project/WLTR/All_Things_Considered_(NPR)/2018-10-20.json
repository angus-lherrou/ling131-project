says it is continuing its investigation into the killing yesterday the Saudi Government abandoned its earlier claim that it had no idea what happened to your show gee he was last seen after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the console it and that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him and unnamed people inside the consulate\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin some on they know that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day 'cause showed you arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body\nPresident Trump said he found the Saudi account of what happened credible he also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nWay out for a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten million of which is a military order but this is equipment and various things order from Saudi Arabia for a hundred and

about deaths of citizens particularly unarmed citizens during police encounters in a few minutes we're going to hear from a Texas lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop but first we want to test\nWho's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop but first you want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office she needed a Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several times this er Kobe later died at a hospital\nAnd it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of thing when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds and sort of those those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you described those things\nHave sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is\nFactual details though aren't they I mean if you were to rabbits someone wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not so for example do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionally the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nTo to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color and black men at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly the mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of ...\nPower intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected to issue to mental health in certain areas and connected as he does raise\nIn terms of how people reacted I haven't been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who shouted out of his classes and story they needed to be told\nThat about a a Kobe she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she must took it for her home and of course amplifying this is that the officer is white and a deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post there had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nWe still don't like\nWhy are you know obviously all rainy\nRoyce West as a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nBut how did you come up with this idea\nWho sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that end up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement during a traffic stop and I guess for land do cats do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up going to steal he's an African American man who shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to find the behavior\nExpectations of citizens and police officers and what's lost here is that people thinking the legislation just focus\nOn citizens will it does it and it doesn't just focus on a video there's really a kind of sets the stage for additional course content\nFor both the citizen and also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that\nThe length of courses at a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the text to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a primer you know if we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations of police officers and citizens and the citizens know what\nWe can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations of police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in the ...\nGive me why is that irrelevant when they issued that used to spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of tension why would you let let ...\nLet me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could establish behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put the behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens\nKnow what their rights I thought put it in schools and making the mandatory was a great place to put it also also driver's license courses\nI'm Christie early host of life from here\nYou

as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society is Roland during that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recently\n... that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and they all expenses paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and signed something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us as going to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nSo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nIt it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges and not to a private organization to describe\nClerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges and not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\n... it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um the Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at this um\nCreating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say in cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who condemned be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges\nThey they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is\nNot fine and what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close now it's about it a try them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see\nWho was paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were make news significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges were\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief blend statements saying they were reevaluating\nWhich suggest that perhaps they might try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible use that's Adam ... he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs

we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the
