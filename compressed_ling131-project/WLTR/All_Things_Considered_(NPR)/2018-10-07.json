S.\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there are eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage\nBut you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nSo it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guaranteed that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow in figure out how to get married and they know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Brewster he wasn't passed through to the Dominican Republic from two

to Mississippi police officers\nSeven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers Terence ... died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nThe violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs\nWe wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us thank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much to number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that but then but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about for this um think of who says versus ... offices\nSo from my perspective it's really what did I they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what that I often there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turn that we as saying that is dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if you look at the most pressing yes we're looking more of them will she is a police officer in meditation\nToday it's not the case if you look at the most recent years we're looking more of them will she is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um west I handling and know persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations ... and ... no longer be\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nAnd you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased to race based and and um with Senate thing the last two years\nIn general the climate on in the last few years is on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus it triggering event then you have the the cut us off it out\nSo somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court\nYou think police officer is pushing back to demonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because it kind of take your anger out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative of the government with the police so\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens and the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be taught\nBeing harmed by civilians often the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um death and the ones that are part of the ... the activity if it does definitely\nEntertaining each shoe office so it's like when they are said in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do\nGiven the as particular environment and given the fed and political development that might be putting their lives in danger so this tactical issue is how you approach and the problem and how you go to the house ah\nWell you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous but I mean we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have eight in South ... police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training\nWould help us mitigate the negative perception of of policing is a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable that nine officers in one year aren't killed in a line of duty an outcome most amended they did the activities that was directed against them explicitly no democratic society should\nAccept a nine police officers in one year in separate incidents killed by members of the top ... can accept\nThat as Maria ... she is a professor in the department of law and police science at criminal justice
