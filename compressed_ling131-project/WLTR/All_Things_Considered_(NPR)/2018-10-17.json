Rocco Syria\nCouple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life and rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like ... in bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks\n... they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nTwain and it's all good pointing from the ... going\nOn at nine and a lot on on\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word\nNell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News you're listening to South Carolina

stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are no border checks for the moment you can have she's running ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant parts from the pool so pretty serious such as soon as being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says what was happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock could cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape up the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential for terrorists as well so the

from NPR News when most people make a mistake they say I'm Sorry but what should accompany\nDo when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith hosted the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments you've been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then the right if he didn't do better because then maybe it's maybe for some of them had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nIn our data so [laughter] I think they think they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect\nThere's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains that it works on scripts and here is six and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we touch with apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may ... ... it was a message that sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thinking that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers flowers and candy and so it takes\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nPeople don't always wanted to ask you this question how do they do I said curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies\nThan they would always it's awfully skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like earnest and since you're in the morsel because people are always was like oh you're just you're not be with your paper [noise]\nSo I have to like go an extra mile to throw this out like earnest and sincere remorseful because people are always just

considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada which raises a question\nWhat happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has slapped in the past\nSuch as this one is it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all I'm In the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use\nWhen founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that\nWhole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever\nUsed marijuana and that can be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAnd a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has\nCan be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admits that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nHe's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legal is\nLegally in Canada who cares Lynn centers he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach the garage doors shaking\nLike somebody's trying to get in and the inside doors shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought\nJust hang in there and I save everything was going to be okay for\nWhen last doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls\nQuite a few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time member urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction\nThis is all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring store\nKen Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised its statewide building code John history no structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricane that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher when ... ... or the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and his awaiting recommendation\nOr the coast well

defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools yesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race\n... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me\nWhy do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and religion and diversity and I'd love to see ... policies change not to have racing it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that raises sort of something like that\nOr is that Harvard is considering one of ... students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they don't do that but what students for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents burned missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well\nAnd sort of use the personal reading to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were scoring higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that's true at all clearly affirmative action has failed and at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work\nThese barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without contacts\nDespite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context\nWhat do you think about idea so\nI think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but\nI think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said merit in the context of economic status or something that speaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you're both agree that there are things about a person's application cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to realizing admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks so much for having me she's a junior at Harvard\nAnd you are listening to all things considered from NPR News for South Carolina Public radio I'm a\nLittle ... we're\nSo many\nOver the south Carolina street fairs and Bruce\nSounds when sensations very many things\nSpecial sound brings back a familiar feeling to nearly every one\nLaw\nFor your heart\nThe rocket is without question the image most people think of would recalling the state fairs in general manager Nancy Smith she gave some history of the ... biggest like on\nThe rocket Israeli and intermediate range ballistic missile the name of the rocket is Columbia it was donated to the city since we are Columbia South Carolina\nAnd in Nineteen sixty nine the rocket was erected on the grounds of the state fair and you know people just go there just to have a little bit of fun and have someone meet them at the rocket\nSmith thinks the rockets appeal is that it's different\nHow many organizations in Colombia have a rocket you can't miss the rocket it's tall that there is a big thing so it was really neat for parents you know always meet back at the rocket the pairs of traditions of the rocket just became a tradition as well but the rocket is really just very unusual\nBut the rocket is hardly the fares only tradition Randy Glen and her husband are creating an art work that has developed a

the orders for for ticket\nRiverbeds and tends to be the sand that we use the most we actually have samples sent to our house that we test and sometimes you know we had a project back in June where\nWe probably went through eight or nine samples before we finally found one that was sufficient for what we needed to do\nGlenn said the sculptors work mostly\nEight or nine samples before we finally found one that was sufficient for what we needed to do\nGlenn should the sculptors work mostly from ideals in their heads\nWe have a basic idea of what we want to do but we do improvise a lot we don't have a drawn out plans we all have pictures of the subject that we're doing but yeah we kind of fly by the state of our parents when it comes to how it sculpted and that kind of thing\nHas what she wants people to get from her work good was reflective\nJust enjoy it and that it's temporary and to really stop and appreciate it have a moment and go okay you know this is it I'm not going to see it again\nBut to look at it and really take in what we're doing I Would like him to take that away\nEnjoy it Smith said cell phones have reduced the need for some to meet friends with the rocket but for many others traditions indoor\nI think part of the people when they come to the band they have traditions parking at particular spot\nThey go to a particular concession yeah they'll eat their bally's corn dogs then they'll have some ice cream then they'll go to the more building maybe they go to the grandstand but then they have this um scenario where all part of their tradition as you know you have to go to the rocket and you have to um page someone to meet you at the rocket\nFor some the rocket may happen even more romantic part of their lives\nI have heard folklore the rocket that that was where they first met at the rocket and I think someone maybe had their first kiss near the rocket I think we have had some marriage on them in ways and one was near the rocket so the rocket is seen lots of things in its day Smith\nShe can't imagine the fear without the rockets\nAnd Glenn said she can't imagine her job to go to South Carolina state fair\nHer job to do dishes in the south Carolina state fair\nThis report also can be rude on South Carolina public radio\nFor South Carolina Public radio\n...

couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall on that [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our swath of a better word they ... they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nTwain and it's all good morning from the ... going on at nine o'clock or not\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance now the researchers who made the original\nWould have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance [noise]\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be
