I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal\nThat some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News I'm\nBobby counter for South Carolina Public radio with health clubs guess here at the Medical University of south\nCarolina studio in Charleston\nEveryday hundreds of children in the U.S are treated in an emergency department as a result of accidental poisonings to talk about poison prevention and children is Dr in Cain he's an assistant professor of pediatrics and a pediatric emergency physician at M. USC children's hospital\nDon't you can't tell us briefly about common causes of accidental poisoning and children\nSo the good news about these poisonings that the vast majorities are minimally toxic we're talking about things around the house like cosmetics deodorant soaps emotions and things like that are more dangerous exposures include things like medicines vitamins cleaners and things you may find in your garage\nAnd do most of these the accidental poisonings involved toddlers in preschoolers in the really young children in the family\nThat's definitely true among all poisonings in the United states children and adults\nOver half of them a current children lesson age six and if you look at that age group there's a real spike in exposures around age one or two and that's because children have become mobile at that time there are crawling around the for picking things up putting things in their mouth especially little pills and things that might look like candy to them\nCan parents and caregivers do to prevent these accidental poisonings the majority of exposures occur in the home over Ninety five percent and so that's really\n... and caregivers do to prevent these accidental poisonings\nThe majority of exposures occur in the home over Ninety five percent and so that's really the place to start and I tell parents really the things to focus on our storage and thinking like a child\nAnd so making sure you have your medicines safely store it in the same spot you know where they are making sure they're in child proof containers for example when kids go to the grandparents' house that's a source of potential problems because\nThe grandparents may not be used to having kids at home and maybe use to leaving their medicines out so that can be a big issue in fact there are several different types of medicines that can be quite dangerous for a child in small doses things like blood pressure medicines medicines to control blood sugar iron pills and depressants\nWe've talked about prescription medicines what about other things that kids common like get into that can really cause some trouble\nOver the counter medicines can be quite dangerous for children things like a typhoon hydro Maine which has been a drill\nTylenol which is the ... and those can be quite dangerous to a child and in an overdose and so a lot of cough and cold preparations to may have a flavor that's you know tempting for a child and if a child drinks a whole bottle of a cough and cold medicine they can cause real problems in a kid or as an adult it would be less of an issue\nIn addition to medicines what are some of the other categories that really can cause some potential problems\nWe've had some issues lately with the church in pods kids getting into those because they sort of have the look of candy they have really concentrated soaps and then they can cause quite a burned to the esophagus when children swallow them another issue we see a lot are concerns about button battery ingestion and so those are those small circular batteries that are in many toys\nIf could swallow these and they get stuck in the U.S off because they can actually burn through and cause serious injury\nAnd don't you can't if you suspect that your child has ingested some thing that could be poisonous what to do right on the spot\nAgain if you suspect that your child has ingested some things that could be poisonous what to do right on the spot sure now as long as there's not an emergency going on the first call I Would make is to poison control there are a great resource and they can walk you through what to do at home and in fact\nOver eighty five percent of the time they're going to be able to prevent you from meeting go into the hospital and to be honest that's often our first call when kids come to the emergency department as we call the poison control as well to get their advice on how to handle it poison control a such a great resource that I Would really recommend that every parent have that number available to call a case of an emergency\nDon't you came thanks for providing this information about poison prevention and kids thanks for having me

reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nOr there's no evidence then as Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that are illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear and his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n\n\n\nHome stretch of the midterm campaign\nThe\n[noise]\nThe third on that Leslie was that tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we hadn't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe ... is not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night already but I have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt\nClassical ... one tonight\nBicycles on one tonight at nine zero South Carolina public radio

... and I'm Audie Cornish\nStrict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year in Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\nBecause the names didn't exactly match names on IDs North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention ... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count\nWe're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business um what we have discovered is that an increasing number of American\nJust the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are on the ...\nCases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls [noise]\nUm even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I\nI think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and\nEleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed or very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n[noise] you know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things
