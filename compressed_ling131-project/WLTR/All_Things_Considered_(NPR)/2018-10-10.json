public not care about the safety for ... they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the owners shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's this really grossly unfair people of course they always care about safety I just think most people assume that if they're in the business that they are minimum requirements that they have to me\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limo safety in twenty Fifteen there was a deadly limo crashed on Long Island

the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same game on private planes headed for Cairo and by\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post to which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... ... has not been heard from us\nAccording to the Washington Post to which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that faded Fifteen people as lots to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still\nDon't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's\nLet's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications have what Saudi officials discussing ...\nIs as us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of a plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in\nAfter a he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate but it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that do we know what\nThe consulate but it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence gained it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ... what my sources\nOf told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U. S. government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person is a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think\nThere's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House in the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nJerk ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is\nJerk ... have been some honor MBBS so she sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] us the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist from all ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade that's the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...

fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerge weeks after the storm has passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington you hold trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told they have to vacate\nWithout a

her head in her hands I'm stressed out\nIf the fact that the red cross here says about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back\nSchools the sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation

step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck is coming\nSmall businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless some business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced and you can't get them back so it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or or your business\nFEMA famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped to disapprove that prediction but it's too soon to tell whether
