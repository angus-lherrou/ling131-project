officer back in two thousand six and came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run in a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt\nIn two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from\nIn a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt in two thousand ah sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this ad\nOn Jason Kansas Senate or boy\nAnd he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling an A R Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he says he supports gun rights supports gun rights but he also support background checks he says to keep terrorists from getting one of these\nAnd then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says\nHe's I'd like to see some of the barn do this\nAnd the ad gone national attention I later I had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician of the Democratic\nParty and his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional let our message or tell us about it\nIt was just hours ago it candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem or that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago um\nHe said that when he should have been celebrating for example or having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in a in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization who started something called the let

gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment and that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh I mean I Can't think of a politician who disclosed this sort of thing except\nUsually on the you know on the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some uh misbehavior\nBut uh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistics saying that suicide has increased especially among ... generation of veterans and Cantor said he wanted to do this in part to help others confront this in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nIs NPR's Quil Lawrence thanks ... thank you Ari\nNow we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage of Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is worth almost a trillion dollars faced a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this here at a meeting in salary at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family of four NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today

NPR sponsors I reached Clark adds that California warehouse\nWhere we're announcing now is a Fifteen dollar minimum they ah before any other out\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I asked Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was just under lemon dollar range of over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff ... [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of the speech and Washington protesting the wide gap between basis as well and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside baseball spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful\nThey just said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage ... said the company listened to its critics one of the most high profile ones husband Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's going voters\nTo its critics one of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's going to be able to write\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe but I'm ... and will cause other companies for Walmart for food and start reading the world for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco had fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news I don't see how it could be other than good news\nIs the author is an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decided to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers are so they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nHowever Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number for a really for what reason but Senator Sanders says he hopes\nUp to Fifteen dollars we think is the right number really for Congress\nBut Senator Sanders says he hopes the ... stamp of approval

death penalty question does it violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVern in Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection\nTwice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because a prosecutorial misconduct the third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dementia and\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime or things of that the state things to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing man so\nPrime things about the state to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and ask the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced\nThe attorney General Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I\nThink if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's skits frantic are delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder\nAnd at some point in time to stay looked forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge believe was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Nobel Prize in physics was awarded today to
