to talk today I understand you've seen the report can you give us your reaction [noise]\nWell I was really frustrated and disappointed by the report that we were given a clearly a the FBI was told to very narrow the scope of people that they talk to I Can't tell you what is in the report but I can tell you that a credible number of\nPeople that both I'm Dr Ford and Mr Mir as gave to the FBI or that corroborate their stories were not interviewed you say\nYou should be a fair was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI's that they are when they're told to be and allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw today in the narrow scope that they've given um that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of get a gal allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them well\nI mean that's part of it and um and what we do know about um situations like this where someone is a victim of sexual assault\nThat they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it is absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that how

yeah the defendants are set in current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity

on now I gather all of these seven Russian officers are\nIn Russia or are there is no us extradition treaty in place so why bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries where there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen\nThe D.

question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the other one's announced their own accusations against Russians is that coincidence or coordinated very much

organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year so the Sergei Skripal ... exactly\nI mean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic ah servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include\nThree of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which begs the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually had a

think about what happens when planets collide she uses to actual\nCannons to simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after large collision knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat is rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rocks paper of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nWas hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that's\nSo different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming up through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did it take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal debates are amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I picked up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on our moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it\nFor example the creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth\nBecame in the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always in the backyard staring at the stars [noise]\nI had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for us studying planets of fall back to actually traveling\nThrough space to laugh I might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration\nAnd our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me\n[noise] Syria Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and to day she was named to the new class of MacArthur fellows
