of all you have to let them know that number one vote count 'em and you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about more than just the sport of it\nWas all athletes that you were talking to\nYou it was after we got a I think it's important for athletes to use their platform and in the right word but more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of the time\nThe state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that really affects you\nI Hope everybody staying safe down there now you've been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was

ask you why why are you pursuing it sounds like similar agendas fighting for social justice but not doing it together\nWell I think you know sometimes there's different ideas of how to go about making sure but I Will say that no matter how you to go about it I think all it all worked with him for that they're doing is important to work that we're doing as a coalition is important um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want to you on the ... the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people who tried to deny what's really going on in our society and I think if I had our way everybody would be the way she met this event\nThey're not what's really going on in our society and I think our way everybody

here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace\nIncluding here at NPR the string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws\nThe key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct animal training aimed at preventing sexual harassment it must also post their policies and highly visible places and the rules apply to all employers regardless of size all this comes as news\nTo Peter ... co owner of ... deli in Brooklyn I haven't heard about it until\nYou can call in Chelsea has six employees and says sexual harassment has never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says we never really had a policy or even written down Sabbath on his radar he says he'll comply bureaucratic hurdles\nThat we're not used to certainly for because of course Frank Kenya as a Rochester based human resources consultant\nHis clients are small businesses he says even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with his point\nKenya estimates over half of the state's small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise the New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe ... to some comedy questions including lived trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd then requires feedback from employees about the training\nAnd the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person\nAnd the materials presented many small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York city you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one day that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is in New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nAnd he went out trading that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protected category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but he says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if employers not during this an employee can report it this is something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are going to read about and people are going to do something about\nUnder the new laws existing employees in New York state must undergo training by October of next year\n...
