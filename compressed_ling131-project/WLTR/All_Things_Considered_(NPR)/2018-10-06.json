the closest margins ever minutes later the White House announced that he would be sworn in during a private ceremony later today NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill Scott welcome thanks for joining us same show\nFirst of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides so as that was happening person after person in the gallery interrupted with visceral personal protests stir mansion\n[noise]\nCircles who spent [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order and the gallery so\nThat's that's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene in the Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities amid hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis this has all been so\nPartisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics ... that people sometimes bring to politics gets you have a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii So is this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat's what I Am with Mr President anger Harry discuss and a process that could not see the

their lack of any empathy over more is for what they had put them through\nWhat let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and his got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine palsy forward sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony did they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often and strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing bet Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo has

Court as you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour\nHas voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you would likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved\nEarlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kevin assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet this the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter I have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now I'm at least it makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision can make an informed decision with all the facts\nThat's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nI think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford by ms Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and\nTo forward by ms Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties I made it there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that [noise]\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we are going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the

P. D. shut nearly four hundred people\nAnd all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense that this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are there people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P than fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger wrist\nEssentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment um but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying\nYou know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWell we'll just have some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting your day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I ah the officer said that\nDriving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive policing practices or after\nThe video was released in the shooting the department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially\nJustice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform look like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of\nEnacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's gonna happen from here\nIs ... she's the host of sixteen shots at a pod cast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's

proceedings that Kevin I wasn't fully truthful\nTo carry a you as you can hear you're getting people from all across the political spectrum but I understand that you were actually telling us what the comments aren't falling neatly along the usual partisan lines tell us a little bit more\nExactly right or in the show that you're playing the comments from my question to the audience was is what's going on with\nBrett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the way you're thinking of some very competitive races in Minnesota\nVote or is it
