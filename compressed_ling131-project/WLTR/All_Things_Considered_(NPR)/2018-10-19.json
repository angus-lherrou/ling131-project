Supreme Court Erin's chaos in the west wing and what happens when you're when when when they get taken down by ... [noise]\nHispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes time I was on the river on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is a ... show that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nOne like no I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are\nI'm a Republican who was born and raised in short immigrants from Mexico\nAnd uh this is an issue where I go sideways with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now this\nSounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is that I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug new see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nHired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it was the ads to approach do secret\nWho's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it was the ads to approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them\nWe need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic\nIf Republicans want to appeal hardy why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he ...\nHe was going to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you go to vote you go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over\nThat's where that sustaining membership comes in you can buy ten dollars a month twenty dollars a month\nMaybe you're up for a thousand dollar gift that will do a long way

let you do how much it is\nYour pledge is needed as that number one eight hundred to five six eighty five thirty five\nYou know out for one of the great thing it's things is that when you do talk to our volunteers\nThey bring your comments in to us is fifty and that's very special to us for example we had a Linda from Greenville who said I Am a grateful listener and I'm a longtime fan we also had

number of repetitive times people have to hear that and here the number before they're motivated to make the call so if you're one of those persons who is a\nUsual and grateful\nPublic radio listener but you've never been motivated yet\nConsidered this your charge we do want to be those MORNING EDITION folks and come up with it it's great grand total toward realizing are go one eight hundred to five six eight five three five shall I say the gang one eight hundred to five six eight five three\nThree fat shall I say the gang yes one eight hundred to five six eight five three\nAnd if you would like to uh out give the MORNING EDITION listeners that's about twenty thousand five hundred dollars will just exactly that much actually\nAnd we're not quite half way toward that yet so again don't

not to find out the facts of what happened you land a and then the next thing we hear from the administration is we need to give the Saudis more time\nThat's right and and he did say that on the on the trip as well 'cause we asked him about the optics of this um that it looks like business as usual with the Saudis and he insisted that he had very direct conversations that they were serious but
