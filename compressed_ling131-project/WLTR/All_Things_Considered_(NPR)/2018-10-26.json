buyout\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry in the days are over them good old days are over\n... between the golf course and his GM's pension he makes less money than he did at the auto

green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes little\nBit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field grew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nOnce I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position joined today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled in on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets any kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don ... son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a cleaner on the midnight shift at willow run when he was a tea do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know that's how I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands\nReally you know like I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh
