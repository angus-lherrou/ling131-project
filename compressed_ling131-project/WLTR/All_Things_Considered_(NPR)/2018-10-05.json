symphonic wins presenting a concert entitled west meet east between music inspired by California Las Vegas in New England\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now crease in the likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate justice some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nThe thing that the judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings draws me to change my mind\nFor a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo American cities or not he said she ... she said questions there that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think sure\nWell we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation and his family\nThat he would have acted like an autonomous on I had\nBy the way he acted like a ton of time\nI think the response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course\nInterviewed well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nForeign sure I one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on this\nPolitical or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people are questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut Tibet specific remarketing or he went on to say was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question\nThat he found the tactics of some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate is up or when controlling unconstitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night and the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to centered ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that she was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf you followed the view
