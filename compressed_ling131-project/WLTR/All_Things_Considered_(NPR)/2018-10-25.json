people and intimidate them\nAnd did that was that happening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation\nOr it so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue

situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an insurance probably because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is a legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration I Want\nTo get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it

want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan as a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison Hernandez down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest Trevor homeland security most of these laws aren't under my major's diction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because Senate Judiciary wasn't able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree

USC\nDr homestead tell us about carotid artery disease\nCredit artery disease is when the carotid arteries which are the major blood vessels in the front part of the neck that feed the brain actually become disease with what we call atherosclerosis or plucking on the insides of the blood vessels\nAnd who's typically at risk for this disease patients that are at risk our patients with vascular risk factors such as diabetes mountainous hypertension hyper ... family history of vascular disease obesity\nAnd smoking is highly associated with the development of vascular disease and are there are symptoms or early warning signs of carotid artery disease that's a great question because not all carotid artery disease it's the same so what we do is we break it down into symptomatic carotid artery disease\nAnd a symptomatic carotid artery disease and what that means that\nSymptomatic carotid artery disease is Wendy blood vessel has become so disease I can actually cause a stroke or a transient

of the carotid arteries that has not caused the problem is they're screening recommended for carotid artery disease currently there's no Medical Association\nThat is recommending broad screening for carotid artery disease in patients that have not had a stroke like symptoms what can be done to prevent carotid artery disease in an individual this is the best question you could ask because prevention is really keen vascular disease\nSo things that folks should do is work with their primary care physicians to modify the risk factors for vascular disease which would include getting blood pressure tax and getting their blood pressure within goal getting cholesterol checked and getting that LDL lip it in a very very low range\nQuit smoking so people that are smoking ad are very high risk for vascular disease not just in a crowded but in any vascular bed in their body and so quitting smoking is key to preventing the disease\nAdditionally we would recommend and only under the supervision of your primary care doc but to consider an exercise program and to be active to reduce your risk of obesity hypertension diabetes and cholesterol\nTell us about this study that you're involved in that is related to carotid artery disease so currently the national Institute of neurological disorders and stroke\nIs funding a clinical trial called crushed to USC is just one of many sites in North America that isn't rolling patients in the study\nAnd basically what that is is looking at patients with chronic disease that has never given them a problem into best medical therapy

Eighteen versus best medical therapy plus either surgical repairs were sending repair you know best medical therapy includes\nHigh ... medications to reduce the risk of that building up and that includes an anti platelet agents such as an aspirin\nAnd also includes lifestyle modification\nAnd then following this patient's over three to five years to see what their outcomes are and the idea is in three to five years they'll be much more information known about which of these approaches seemed to help that's exactly it to really helps determine patients that have carotid artery disease a

De Niro and two in Delaware for former vice president Joe Biden and makes a total of ten packages sent this week to prominent critics of President Trump along with CNN [noise]\nThe big question of course is who sent them the head of the ... of the FBI is New York office William Sweeney gave an update on the investigation to reporters today\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nNPR's Hansi Lo long has been reporting on the investigation from New York City and ... where does the investigation stand at this point into these packages\nOr you have a really a full force of law enforcement trying to figure out why this happened who was behind this or this includes the FBI then my ... D also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages\nAre found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling and law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's\nLab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York office or the eyes William Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is ongoing or wherever it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such and she'll proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these you know explosive devices\nRising these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these you know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're they're focusing in the investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is where these packages sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by sure you're and also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents out from the bureau of alcohol um [noise]\nUh firearms a division and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who is the individual or individuals' behind this and also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out\nTomorrow morning at nine\n[noise]\nGetting older

soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week\nAnd he's Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck hit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShow I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David Hey Audi so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with a several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter]\nIt's really you get in trouble if you are a white person who was on the wane or a black person it puts out a way that we like that that was okay as long as you were a character\nAnd that of course they're tapping into a rich being a pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story of both by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks\nI and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from El wrote her a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nA bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh\nAround the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin uh depressed the newest co host of today's show he waited as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and it's nice and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as a statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany any lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly has his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to her own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in a twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings\nAre and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times the me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment against some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this or a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall and I ... at that nine eleven\nReaction and and a welcome from employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd I ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet begging\nKelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween oh I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round eroded um we do every year old who was in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface I've been an advocate Halloween is is Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well walk us\nThrough some of the history of this when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people are talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad the humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n... is the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n[noise] my bank\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian Americans think of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against us\nTo be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOne of the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missile shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history\nWhat do you make of that [noise] [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense none of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white and I went to the port and\nShe's going to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context we always start in a store go vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you've raised it more is this something we should just agree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so many controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there's not a black person independence and no one at that party me about an eyelash\nPerson you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person independence and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video has to contend with a different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery\nAs well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black base\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen thank you so much Mary Louise scenic looks over [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise]\n\n\nThis is NPR News\nDid you know that you can

from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined\nBasic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now\nWants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador in their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day than we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S Russian gang members were deported back to Central America\nUnited States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in\nUnited States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here\nIn our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nI Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end\nIt is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations actually much my pleasure [noise]\n\nListening to all things considered from NPR\nYou're listening to all things

President Trump\nThey include former president Barack Obama former vice president Joe Biden\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that after and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the package at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have

reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you Mary Louise how you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border which as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an insurance partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is a legal immigration system that works and whether as there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\nBut I I I don't know if I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and that was found units set of eyes by laws
