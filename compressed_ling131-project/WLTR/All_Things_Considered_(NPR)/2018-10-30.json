Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with ... Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose actual hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say that Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as excited on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House as critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections I is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending

arts from NPR News\nThis is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country to go around the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled then they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nThink that the threat\nBy the women's march\nThis is Michelle nearly she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did tip in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates I think are\nTime for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\n... he's away from family we show what is\nWhat\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including ... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election\nCycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI ask you a Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nOr religious in the middle of it because I was in the news all the other police officers safe on in life\nThe real religious in the middle of all because I was in the ... the other police officers safe on in life\nWill he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad he sticks to my brother's history\nThere are all star game\nWe use ...\nEvery day in the ...\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything where the birds resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara really right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the U.S\nIt's really I think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and some black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't\nAs a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on pack\nWonderfully be seen on is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC on directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee

the c._e._o. of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally toward but again went on a

he would hope would be present on gab isn't there so what users tend to do when platforms\nGet filled with troll cereal harasser as\nPeople generally opt out not many people go on line to\nDefend

listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm Bobby Connor for South Carolina Public radio with health focus here at the Medical University of South Carolina studio\nIn Charleston when a national tragedy or acts of violence occur in our world adolescence may need extra help in conversations with parents\nTo talk about helping teens cope in the aftermath of national tragedy is Dr which show Hansen she's a professor in the departments of psychiatry and pediatrics and she is the director of the family and child program at the national crime victims research and treatment center at M. U. S. C.\nDr Hanson when a national tragedy or violent event happens what can parents do to help their teen cope with this event\nTeens just like younger children are going to need to feel like they're safe they're also going to have a lot of questions and they're going to want answers and explanations to have a better understanding of what happened\nThe biggest challenge we face with teens is that they tend to look to their peers for answers to their questions rather than seeking out caregivers and other adults\nSo what can a parent do than to make a difference\nCaregivers can let their child and know that they're there for them and look for opportunities to have open conversations so for example at dinner time checking in with their teen and asking them what did you hear about what happened today what did you hear from your friends when did you hear from other people it's\nFor example at dinner time checking in with their teen and asking them what did you hear about what happened today what did you hear from your friends when did you hear from other people at school from teachers that provides an opportunity to have a conversation about the experience and to correct any misinformation the team may have\nAnd what other extra help can you think of that teens might need\nHaving a conversation about healthy ways to cope after a tragedy is really important letting teens know that sometimes when bad things happen people may turn to alcohol or drugs but that's not helpful\nAnd reminding them of more helpful an objective ways to cope after a traumatic event things like talking journal ling seeking out conversations with friends or with other trusted adult letting teens know that those are more adaptive ways to cope can be really helpful to reduce the risk for long term problems\nAnd what about teens who seem extra anxious or fearful even as time has gone by\nIts problems persist two to three months after the incident it's helpful for the teen and the parents to seek out professional help perhaps talking with a trusted doctor or a mental health professional or school guidance counselor what\nElse can parents do to sort of keep their eyes and ears open and help their teenager one\nThing I Would suggest is that parents have a conversation with their teens about social media and about watching TV and watching the news and the Internet because we know that for teens particularly those who have been especially affected by what happened very anxious very fearful\nGreater media exposure can increase fear the parents need to do is to let Thirteen now you might want to consider limiting your time on social media because we know that that can make you feel more afraid\nAnd don't your Hansen what other ways mites\nLimiting your time on social media because we know that that can make you feel more afraid\nAnd don't your hands and what other ways might some teams respond when a national tragedy occurred\nSo for teens you do want to take on an advocacy will caregivers still playing an important role first they should have a conversation with their teen about why they want to take on that kind of role second they need to be supportive and Sarah they should have that discussion with their teen about parameters for taking on that kind of role\nDr Hanson thanks for providing information about helping teens cope after a national tragedy my

sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legend scheme intended to make ... look back at\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of as Hey Ryan either\nFirst what has the special counsel's office that exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller car does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's office as you know is usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she

around the corner as you said and certainly this\nCould be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nUh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six in a a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nThank you Ebola has been spreading through an

something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to ...\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other route feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and some black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans\nOut of it well black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB feeds 'em directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that\nBut I oughta is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that\nTelephone your congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna Pressley herself with no major opposition at her Massachusetts district Presley is set to become the first black woman to represent her state in Congress [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News you're listening to South Carolina public radio\nCaroline alive present in ... or so Carolina presents
