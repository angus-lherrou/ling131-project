acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you\nThink yeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu and I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being asked you to be the woman being a first year\nWe've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae woman being a first generation American being a veteran and I think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nAre definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballads that would've uh regulated where trans individual could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellows in and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell us so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nI Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I always like to thank folks that like you and\nStark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my eggs inside a [laughter]\nAnd I I mean it it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting\nIt was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and demeaned but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae be tiki writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before\nAnd I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nTo look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again we're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beauty acute candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national\nLandscape for future LTV T. Q. candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what a meal you discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nOne of the things that has really\nI think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYeah one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene Amelia do as well to those young people that are following behind us I Want to thank\nAll three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New

their recommendation we recommend that all people six months of age and older get a flu vaccine annually\nFor little ones for their first season often get to vaccines a month apart but everyone else is just the one vaccine each year\nAnd what about the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for children in particular\nIn terms of the flu vaccines advocacy we know that children who get vaccinated are less likely to get the flu and if they do get the flu than they are less likely to get complications from the flu or be hospitalized because of the flu we also know that the flu shot is more effective than the nasal spray vaccine\nAnd we know that there is also the concept of herd immunity in other words the more people that get vaccinated that protects the greater number of people but the efficacy of the flu vaccine\nIs pretty high and the reason for that is that scientists actually have to predict the following years vaccine and what strains are going to be circulating in order to make the right vaccine for the following year\nAnd document when is the best time of the year or the season to get vaccinated the time is now Bobby so right here at the beginning of October\nThat's when the flu vaccines are out and now is a good time because that way you'll be protected through the end of the flu season and sometimes that season extends through April or may\nOr even sometimes into June

that you're not spreading it through your household or to other people\nAnd then people often ask about the anti viral medications that I Would just say that those are not without side effects some of which are quite significant and they are quite expensive and often we run out of them each flu season so certainly the anti virals are not a substitute for the flu vaccine and\nThat's something that should be discussed with the child's physicians and if a child gets the flu are there any symptoms that you can mention\nThat might indicate it's time to seek medical care for that child the most

heavy steel doors for the women that's not a somebody here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don and tell them to ask depending on what level there and that's the warden showed dom showing us around and do what we do that and the community of when I was parked outside and our yard went in ... and I guess\nStill a prison the war is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules\nAre specially harsh because across the country women get disciplined that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rolls they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insulin disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions can have big consequences women get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had to ... I have um\nThat's the word and shovel dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow dom toes were corrections officers to give up fewer tickets like for breaking the rule that a prisoner can alter their uniform\nIt was written for a men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDumb as putting in place a practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different paths to prison\nThere are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different pass the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last [noise]\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runners in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt just meant to be punished\nOnce she was sick and steaming herself through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put the fire pillow so I was asleep when this crime happens [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item yeah that was pretty rough\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then wonder says she wants good conduct credits those are days taking off her sentence for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder is serving time per second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nAnd trying to contribute as much they institution so I'm not so shame [noise] you know and it has helped me with my own my own shame and my only regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about large common room with ... therapy\nI don't regret the psychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nTo sell their forces here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chained for months at a time in a basement\nSold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get the prison with the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns\nAs the inmates are running the prison the wording has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said as you know word and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get in Ninety six to not caused problems\nTom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down\nAnd it's the one of their place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now it closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yellow into the night\nThis is what prison cells today across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that [noise]\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nThat gets back to why giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News\nLaura how women running in prisons are making a difference in the way they are rough you're listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR News this program is made possible through membership support\nAnd by southern environmental law center using the power of the law to champion South Carolina's environment

Kushner President Trump's close advisor and son in law during ... time at the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nNPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including ports\nScrutiny after ... disappearance NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here to tell us more about questionnaires role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first a cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many\nLeaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration ...\nA bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this\nBut President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president and so a big part of cushion his portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east\nAnd coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that a U.S ambassador to the UN\nSo is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that a U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role in working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared enough that there is such a hidden genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires are influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above\nAll to now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it I'm for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ...\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance oh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nAh to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security shame\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nOutside the national security change and then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion her family Trump and the Saudis\nAnd a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear as\nSome of these dealings are are not transparent but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports\nUh that cushion or a Christian or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things considered\nHurricane Michael has according to the latest count\nClaimed twenty six lives across several states many of those deaths occurred during the storm when homes collapsed or when people were carried away and floodwaters but even after hurricane is over it can still be dangerous as Jake Harper reports from Panama City Florida\nI find you just have\nDrinking Ninety like with his neighbors Smith from your part of his house was collapsing is why would sign up ...\nYou wrote with magic marker we need an electrician before the sign of hope someone brought by he's walked powered days ago and hurricane Michael so he runs a generator for fan and refrigerator extension cords reached the

catastrophic situations and you're in a crisis you're not really thinking as clearly as you might day to day I mean\nPeople do bring them indoors\nWhen you're in these catastrophic situations and you're in a crisis you're not really thinking as clearly as you might day to day I mean in day to day it's obvious you wouldn't bring it in the house but when you've got a real different set of circumstances than doesn't seem so\nSo strange to do and it kills people from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen Seventy one people died from carbon monoxide poisoning after hurricane or tropical storm the most common reason for these kinds of ... is that people put the generator in their home our garage so Brickell says don't do that\nMake sure it's at least twenty feet away from your home so that any carbon monoxide will not enter your home and will not cause any illnesses or death\nI mean is there a risk of electrocution to\nAbsolutely things have gotten wet but now they're sort of back to normal\nAnd the power's back on or you've got a generator hook to them but making sure they have been checked by professional before they're used as very important\nAnd there are other risks ... helps run emergency management for the governor's office in Louisiana he says when people go back to their homes after a storm they might not understand how dangerous can be to power tools for example he says it could be someone's first time using a chainsaw\nCertainly as you go to your trees all through your property you know trying to restore your home is broken glass and shingles and residents are really in danger of getting hurt you know your to most cases\nAnd for in a funk with the Centers for Disease Control and prevention says remember the elements\nPeople are out of power and you know

mental health issues in mind to the CDC says to be aware of the signs of stress like short temper or using alcohol or drugs more\nSometimes people don't have access to their medications and things like that that help them you know handle stressful situations so know that it's normal to have trouble sleeping and you know feeling anxiety about this and to you know reach out for help\nAn electrician shows up while I talked to have you on a fixed income and doesn't know how much it will cost to get his power back before I leave he shows me a tree yeah\n... ... see which way it's going

openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae BP to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that is we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you\nThink yeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu and I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being asked you to be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nAnd when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae woman being a first generation American being a veteran and I think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race\nWants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government\nUm we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals' could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia ... twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellows in and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell us so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nI Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I always like to thank folks that like you and then pave the way of says he ...\nJust how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you ... and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age and tell you I'm [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but\nWhen you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence addressed the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that an anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican\nThan it was no I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties folks\nTwo incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again we're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beauty acute candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they
