but since the opioid epidemic young adults are now among those at high risk for overdose some schools aren't taking chances NPR's Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose and what to do\nAnything you know Ohio University is using this video dramatization\nYou just show how ... can that drug known generically as a lock sound can reverse in overdose newly Ohio University is one of many schools that make nor can available through health services and campus police\nSeveral other

December later boxes on campus that are now also stocked with little bottles of ... nose spray all clearly labeled in red as opioid overdose kits and all free for the taking\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the middle of an epidemic that affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police putting our canon every norm in parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you do you feel those facts you would hold it like this for the tip into the patients natural\nAbout three quarters of an inch down into the nasal passage when he was just given once ray\n... and then you're done that's in junior Isaiah ... one of the resident advisors who've been trained\nYeah man I'm ready and I think personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone who was overdose could actually save another versus I I think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but\nI mean it was probably blatantly obvious honestly I was it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago his school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it\nBarely existed even a few years ago his school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that but he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe gone to that is you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them is if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by and we\nUnfortunately our colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to take it into their own hands\nJulian ... teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them with narcan as well as fentanyl testing strips\nJust like they would send them um with condom junior encourage them to see first acts they can create like a fee for drug use ... for them and here\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if your interest junior was planning on studying for their exam that having had an old testing strips and their drawer is going to be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and try them\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts and arcane runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd and the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiative several kids placed off campus have been successfully used a program director Lucas hills says all those on campus remain untouched Mrs at least\nPlaced off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hills says all those on campus remain untouched\nThis is at least one data point that says that may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus is not the hot spot\nHills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars but he cautions lock sewn alone is not the answer\nColleges also need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose death he says is not the same thing as curing addiction Tovia Smith NPR News\n\nNew for listening to all things considered

following the buzz around the upcoming sale and she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you pleasure to be here Elsa how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human\nAnd all this and welcome thank you a pleasure to be here also how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auctioned off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel do shop where he literally took a men's urine and hang it on a wall right and it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so\nI don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of word those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the saying we'll house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people\nI don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the color is the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work has gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is a first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited and numbered edition after the sale I don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare era appraisals just
