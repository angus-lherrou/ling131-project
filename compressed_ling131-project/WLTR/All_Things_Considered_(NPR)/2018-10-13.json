in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are

minute here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women with a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women\nOr as he says never on the clock though you know never while I'm actually on the clock but yeah and you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to

says never on the clock though you know never while I'm actually on the clock but yeah and you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different\nConversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth and value are determined by my\nAppearance and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of the same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling for me\nWhat is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOf the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my\nPre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have these wild on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex as as uh\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my\nPre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex as as the rest of the culture but in hip hop and there was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nI Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to them in the republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with her accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity so having accented English actually just means I speak two languages\nSay for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show\nShe's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself\nBecause actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually does means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual ... went to United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places on for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India\nAnd he said but he got cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really\nTry to set my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed upbringing ...\nMy material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with injury and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives\nPeoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and I had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of a pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like well what is it which is that you talk white you this do that yeah I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's
