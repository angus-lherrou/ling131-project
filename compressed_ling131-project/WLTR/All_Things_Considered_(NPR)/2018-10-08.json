persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser\nOr not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really surprised me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of been a steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift just sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posted there really lengthy almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything though [laughter]\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well you know Tillerson\nBut anyway so [laughter] they kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world\nShe didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now are ... are being played on pop radio and she had to have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has this country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day\nAnd [laughter] I always said I had her mind immediately\nExactly Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out unless you didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her\nSexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet

of member station WHYY reports Trump ministry officials are watching and promising crackdown\nSince earlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant steps so far and making that a reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell\nTwelve hundred and Seventy Philadelphians died of overdoses most of them die alone in the year twenty Seventy science re per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop in\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites that haven't done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use\nIts position shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection sites in Philadelphia remains illegal\nUnder federal law and people engagement activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement\nMessages from us Rosenstein um incorporate or of the safe injection site nonprofit and they can come and arrest me first\nRun ... says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting\nMayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis\nBut offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely round the gold fine with the AIDS project in Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with the nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit has already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes Kensington\nMaria Sanchez is still on the [noise]\nBefore we can talk about exercise as a pool within\nA recent visit to Kensington the desperation was everywhere

were using just his first name because he uses illegal opioids so I've been to ground zero of zombie laying man it's it's just crazy raise wearing a pink shirt and shorts and has a Phillies baseball cap\nHe says he'd go to the supervised injection sites because right now he uses next door Stanford and they only way back yard or anywhere\nThey felt officials won't stay up when they hope to open the doors but one thing is clear they say is getting people like ray off the streets and into a metal\nThey've also officials won't say yet when they hope to open the doors but one thing is clear they say is getting people like ray off the streets and into a medical facility means defined the Trump Administration\nSo be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she they facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images the when the elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know changing age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is visual\nIt was really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas [noise]\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question\nSo either win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face recognition technology\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that's certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse\nWhether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nSomething that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are Alice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank

so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments and nine to you know to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food is just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressman or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights have spent decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this first food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poison squad experiments once
