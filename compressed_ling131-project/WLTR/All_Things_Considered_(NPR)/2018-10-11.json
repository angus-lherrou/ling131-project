really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis\nOr because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are and Trump claimed that west coming out in support of them has

Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify it supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get your premium although you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to MIT\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come in the using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and ... people\nBut uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lifted DNA behind a wheel K with if foreign governments are going to exploited the technique to identify us to do for their own purposes so there are many scenarios that you can think about me even\nNow many people defend the

that need to be solved\nAnd grey tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect

reduce workplace stress is Dr ... she's an assistant professor in bilingual licensed clinical psychologist at the national crime victims research and treatment center at M. USC\nDoctor or Ringo ugh why oh what's the potential negative impact to health and wellbeing when someone is chronically under stress at work\nOur body is really resilient and equipped to handle stress about when we're stressed constantly asked when our body breaks down\nSo when we're experiencing chronic workplace stress things such as FedEx stomach aches irritability low product to that he can happen breakdowns in social relationships with coworkers and some people you've been can experience depression anxiety as a result\nOr there's certain circumstances are scenarios that seemed to cause more chronic stress in the workplace a number of scenarios\nCome to mind the most common ones are not really having a say\nBut when we're stressed constantly when our body breaks down\nSo when

been can experience depression and anxiety as a result\nOr there's certain circumstances are scenarios that seemed to cause more chronic stress in the workplace a number of scenarios\nCome to mind the most common ones are not really having a say over one schedule or control over one's duties and interestingly not feeling really connected and to meaningful work in the job place\nAnother area of chronic stress or actually relationships with co workers so bowling in the workplace harassment or perhaps being overworked and not feeling like you have that choice or saying the matter so what\nCan the individual due to sort of take good care of themselves if they find themselves in a situation that has a lot of stress\nSo the good news is that there is a lot under our control to manage chronic workplace stress the first and foremost thing is identifying strategies that are easy quick and simple to do to manage the stress such as taking breaks even thirty seconds just closing ones eyes and taking a deep breath can help\nEating lunch in a place other than in front of the computer is super important as well also trying to connect with at least one person that you get along with that you could perhaps talked to during breaks\nAnd finally there's this thing called mindfulness which is simply paying attention on purpose to the present moment so noticing what thoughts feelings are showing up for me right now and how can I bring some have hot under my control right now\nElse about mindfulness skills that you can share\nJust closing ones eyes and taking a deep breath can

now\nAnd how can I bring some of that under my control right now anything else about mindfulness skills that you can share burnout and chronic stress actually develops lock under our awareness so the first and foremost thing we could do is bring any sort of tensions ... that's called being mindful\nSon example of this perhaps as a meeting with co workers where someone says something you don't agree with or that makes you perhaps a bit angry so being mindful means noticing anger showing up taking a pause taking a deep breath and continuing to engage in behavior that you can be proud of\nBeing mindful means I'm noticing that I'm feeling stressed right now irritated and my job's important to me\nAnd does that thinking that's going on really just sort of calm you down is that part of the stuff that's happening absolutely so human beings really thrive on being in control\nSo part of mindfulness is bringing attention to what's showing up in the moment and taking control of our behavior is which is something we actually can do something about Dr Ringo ... thanks for providing this information about reducing workplace stress thank you\nFrom the Medical University of South

I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong\nAnd then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of\nInformation people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on

building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back

to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they ... to come home than they are\nAbandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough chef that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it it's going to be a really complicated\nSo here's the stocks to the space station and sort of like a\nLifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want ah okay but if\nThey ...
