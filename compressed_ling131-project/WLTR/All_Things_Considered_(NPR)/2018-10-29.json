they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that\nThe president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents\nAre and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even

personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different

Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nI guess she doesn't have any of this was more than she does that I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him a thief without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally\nAnd and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the maternal what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump

been organized last couple of days I'm at Carnegie Mellon university it sits on the border of squirrel hill which is where the attack took place in Oakland\nAnd officials say the organized vigil to help the community mourn and one of the people that was killed in Saturday's attack was Joyce Feinberg she worked down the street at the University of Pittsburgh for a long time and her husband taught here at seeing you for a long time\nPresident Trump is planning to visit tomorrow with the first lady um what if people you've been talking to said about that what do they want to hear from him\nWell one person I spoke with his mirror Patel she's a senior at Carnegie Mellon she heard about the president's plans and she's in two minds about it\nI mean he is our leader so we do have to respect that that also sometimes you\nFeel that is the really coming here for the right for\nThat is similar to what my colleagues and I've been hearing from a number of people in the past few days that President Trump is our president and that he is the griever and chief but also that rhetoric has been so division of that they're not quite sure what they would hear and what they would hope to hear\n[noise]

the city feels like it's being more gentle to itself\nI Would say we're a small city in squirrel hill and the Jewish community form a central part of it\nSo people that we've talked to feel horrified and hearts sick and there's this shared sense of violation that our neighbors were attacked as they prayed and I spoke with a rabbi this morning I Know and he needs a large conservative congregation

department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general parents are ... who's in charge of northern command Reno borders\nMoving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general tyrants a shot to see who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more car bear a barrier is more razor wire fencing of crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah they're only to support role again and the plus he ... his law dates for the post civil war\nThese troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or they're only in a support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen Seventy is and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others uh we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay [laughter] the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot\nThese troops are doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSoviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq and maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said\nA border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments Pentagon thank you Tom\nWelcome in their quest to win back the house of representatives Democrats are focused on twenty five house seats currently held by Republicans in districts

won in two thousand sixteen\nFlorida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those districts and he's betting that his independent reputation will attract Democrats and Republicans alike NPR's Kelsey Snell reports\nCarlos Curbelo isn't shy about confrontation here is this summer bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal with Trump to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions\nFor immigration\nThat took her belly was spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change and trade but he also largely voted to back the president's agenda when it comes to health care and tax is\nNow he's running for reelection in a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nI don't remote remember ever apologizing for anything\nI've said whatever I've said is what I Believe so why would I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him winning twenty sixteen but Democrats like Maria ... Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent\nImages and for him so he Tulsa taught that he's a moderate but when you see his voting record that is completely not the case and unfortunately most voters do not do that extra step and they just hear him and they say well you know he sounds good this year his opponent Democrat ... Powell is trying to change that\nYou know they need information we need to provide information and access and make voting easy\n... is an energetic for educator mom and\nInformation we need to provide

occur Bello says he also wants to protect their locked in a battle to convince voters who's telling the truth\nI should be I had basic things going to face a straight democratic district but it's not it's complicated\nConvincing voters who's right is a unique challenge in a diverse district that stretches from the suburbs of Miami fell through farm fields and onto the tourist hub of Key West about Seventy percent of the population is Hispanic roughly half are Cuban descent\n... the son of Cuban exile gets a warm welcome from a lot of voters here he slips seamlessly between Spanish and English when he was talking to constituents and he pairs boundary pushing politics with personal attention take a recent event worker Bello and Senator Marco Rubio we're pushing back on Trump's new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nAll hardly mentioning Trump by name\nWe walked her how strong a trade relationships with our allies bought\nWe believe that this should be fair\nThey focused on a new bills health area fruit and vegetable growers were largely left out of the new trade agreement people like Republican tomato grower Karen Carpenter said that personal connection is important\nI mean it's hard not to like the guy like that I mean when it comes to listen and tries to\nDo something about the problem that affects state and who's area I'm\nAnd I'm so small you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises but in the car so Powell also worries that the people apart and needs to

NPR News\nBy most accounts Federal Reserve policymakers have been very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed success has also undermined one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips curve\nIf you put it in a murder mystery framework who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves ...\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard the president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and\nWhat was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the ... and wrong persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\n... says the Philips curve isn't working but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated\nIt certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour retail the fellas\nHow is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSo pale to fill us car I wouldn't say that\nA little more central bank humor this time in an apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parrot in a cage\nTo complain about it touches all offered to do this but if the Norwegian firm with us today was thrilled with this was\n\nWhen I was looking at what\nThe filters curve could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and one to two\nDifferent ways in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhether the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response Owen thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that were confirmed your beliefs about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say give me Rowan stable
