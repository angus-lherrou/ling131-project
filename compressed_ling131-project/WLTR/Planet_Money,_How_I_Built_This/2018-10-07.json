I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise] we have long lists\nOf gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones\nA new gene editing technology called ... per cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are basically acting like super heroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right\nThat I ... I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with\nThings that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology\nThat could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that that technology is a promising like if there was a in a way to make a child more resilient to pan or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have each other\nA great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nYou might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits do inherit from the parents something we can already do with Avi A. F. N. genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet absolutely\nSo do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes use your five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders\nDisease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes use your five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wanders\nSweeping given that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up ending that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched tainted left alone\nOf course probably do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient\nBut when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only effect that individual but that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this\nVery radio issue of directing future evolution [noise] [noise]\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it ... embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with\nIQ or being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's weird\nYeah and their children and their children and their children\nAnd so that's where I think you have this very rainy issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it in embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise]

make us who we are\nThere's a lot to unpack hair set to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff ed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how ...\nWhat what is it that makes us who we are\nWell there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection better equip us with a set of motives and emotions and\nMechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just said and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best [noise]\n[noise] okay just to get us started human beings\nHave debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates and\nAll of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from historian who they are ... you got man has no instincts and the anthropologist actually want to give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nHochul a scientist Stephen J gold ...\nWhy should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial for most is that if we're blank slates then by definition\nStill are in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from me historian Jose Ortega you got that man has no instincts and the anthropologist actually want to do the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J goals ...\nWhy should have been such an appealing notion well there are number of political reasons why people have found congenial foremost is that if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero but if something is written on the slate and some people could have\nOthers and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature is that\nIf we were blind place we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instincts than perhaps some of them like Dennis To selflessness prejudice and violence\nFirst of all there are number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate and some of them are just coming from the common sense as many people have a
