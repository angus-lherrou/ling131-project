connection to it and its power to change so much\nThe way we live I just bought a bottle of water and on the label of said gluten free interest [laughter] well\nAbout the way we live I just buy a bottle of water and I'm the label is head gluten free interesting\nWell and it is [laughter] that says food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and my friend describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat and become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call Monica cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um\nBut if you look in the late nineteenth early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown now I Know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Sawyer corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nThan to it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there\nMost bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe a baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert\nStore bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad by the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\n... and ... like what you were saying earlier are a lot of that has to do with with the fact that [noise]\nVery stuff that will kill you\nGet any like what you were saying earlier ally that has to do with with the fact that like one thing we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables and winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think among men and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWhile I Do think you know I did this book called the B. six vegan before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinnertime and do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know a a head of broccoli doesn't need a label because the head or broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nThat category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n[noise]\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food\nIs the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients implants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrot\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health votes have been marketed heavily creating on natural demand we're not orange craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for every one that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food [noise]\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise]\n\nWriter Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at Ted that come on line that you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next who knows how long is it great\nLeave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long is a great recipe that you put out years ago it was a pasta and spaghetti sardines bread crumbs\n... about the great use of sardines gray how can you not eat pasta ... you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which is paleo from home a housing costs is going to Julia ...\nHe's a marked him as saying that that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but they had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate it's Seventy four percent will act Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert Lustig he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco\nSo there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... digital I meet them or are that's even someone famous now apple puree or evaporated Keynesian yeah my favorite because\nCages so you know just healthy right what happens when you evaporate changes you get sugar [noise]\nSome people like to look at the world through rose colored glasses I before the lens of the social sciences there's more than one or two women\nAlmost literally on the bachelor\nMay carry in our heads the thumb print of the culture I'm\nShankar view that the host of

from NPR I'm Guy Raz Amish I'd say food why we eat what we eat and why our food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates\nWe all think we taste food and ... and yet that's an illusion in the sense that ah most of what you're tasting the fruit to the floor let me to the Hubble the bones of Smokey are actually being vacated by nostrils but our brain is doing is wonderful job of ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and making me believe as if it's coming from I ... this is Charles Spence or out of the ... uh ... university [noise] what is the cross motor research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... so lab right here in the psychology department where we look at how the senses interacts\nN gas our mouth and nose interact when we eat but said or mouse and our ears\nWeeding experiments where we're feeding people a potato chips out each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound that they could sometimes making their own crunching ... [noise]\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel showed up as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunching as the freshness of these other attributes that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might call a white wine artificially ... with an odorless tasteless food dye addict\nHow it tastes\nOne might call a white wine artificially ... within ... tasteless food dye\nAnd they've done appropriately you'll find the experts the wind make says we'll get fooled into smelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine [laughter] all the ... the tobacco and the dark chocolates in stone fruits and so on even though they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles Spence on the stage\nUm here this morning and say I'll tell you about the perfect meal\nWorld convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavors ... of the wind and the glass\nBut if I was going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink\nOut of the question is how to study how to measure it and the tendency among the scientists that when you're a guest on this is this thing people like your eye and a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain ... this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy running is one problem here\nWhich is that in fact in the matter is that one of the brain scan is kind of lie on your back where they had climbed stale with a Cuban your marriage\nThat periodically square sin ah some drink you call it can be useful at your head all kind of jolt and that will spoil that the brain scan alignment but it's got to tell you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal in one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us may come into something very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be that raised them the mood you're in\nSome holidays by the beach somewhere these often will stay in people's minds as as best meals about ... what I guess has to be that raised them the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining a no one has ever had that perfect meal when they're fighting with that part in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relax your holiday less stressed Tripoli with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions of its um I was going to problem solve rose a paradox use to describe a northern Europeans um but to Italy who gave for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nThat sitting somewhere or on the side of the sea suffering not rose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all laugh and not tasteless like the best I said why you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show good taste you have in that you bring it back\nAnd then you just pointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah I can say what happened is it something about when they when they are playing with a cold and not you know sport the wind things not ... we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments and certain states\nOf mind an all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it I mean somebody in a way some\nMyths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\nWhat we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile in a way some\nMyths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food\n[noise] in fact is Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and you know methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood to taste good if you're in a bad mood I ain't never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but outbreak has brought me everything else the thousands of single the smell of the salt and see how the walls of the sun on a box all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that insight or in the dishes they so so that any of that too much to install restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition star restaurant\nA white tablecloths\nWas not ... on the table was no glasses or in a place where nothing there's just a plastic car people wait and see what he wants to be here seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can see what will tables full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up seriously that plastic how I Wonder if they get up you know there is a little one euro tower and it makes it moving sound and sort of some of those type of other that will be laughing and then you can guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving higher was\nLaughing Dina's and that is the moment when it first comes out because then he has successfully nothing more than one euro table enhanced the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise] wow so aside from from a neurological perspective\nTo re fully understand what's happening like why that's the case [noise]\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case\nIt's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with ... which is if you have here in London and he's been I'm sending our question as several weeks have to ... his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and\nPeople are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they remember the experience but I felt about it and that brand kind of fills in the rest of the details of what I think they thought they were reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste of food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days just the sourcing the preparation but nothing else but\nHe says their case and your restaurant um do you serve the food in their plastic cutlery known as a silver isn't and what does your restaurant exactly oh it's in a country manor house looking at it and they just\nSort of the St Louis things on the one hand but clearly you can have a sort of ... through just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nThere's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the youngest one eye popping up starting\nTheir own venues who who are really thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were swimming [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book it's called the perfect meal you can see his entire talk at head that NPR out or\n\nSaid let's get shafted a little bit\nYou can see his entire
