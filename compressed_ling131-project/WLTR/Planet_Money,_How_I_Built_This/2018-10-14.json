have you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing\nIn certain books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes\n[noise] [noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal\nOur legal things\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese graves you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes\nThe legal things [noise] [noise] so ... so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times uh thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nAnd the person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI don't mean like you mean like ... men or actually\nFreeman or persons\nBut slaves were not sometimes women were not ... sometimes children were not now and I'm all human beings are considered to be the person's [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons like it is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain\nHow that works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of ...\nIt is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations

Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nEven live in these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals that to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nKnow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair\nIndeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defenseless and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless the billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take along\nI realize that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time\n[noise] so your objective at that time was to essentially [noise] change the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much\nTo be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the one\nCritical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called ... versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later\nOf an entity from a thing to a person's nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Stephen ... was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa she survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because of an Eighteen century slave\nOne of the major responsibility Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight and enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London\nSigned him bring them to shift the ana marry that was\nTo set sail for Jamaica were James was\nTo be sold in the slave markets\nWell now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeas corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I have to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nAnd the demand is any issue a common law written of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset and he said this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because then James\nSummers that was a legal thing he was not eligible\nFor a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that Jane Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on\nJune twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Summers that underwent a legal trends substantiate Asian the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walk them but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find who James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of so\nFar or chimpanzees and

about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out\nTen thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the countries and making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be\nSo completely different uh but so much better from my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self\nIt wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be\nSo completely different but so much better from my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nI Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of a government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection buddy ... wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John as some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry a contract has got to the galaxy guy Douglas Adams is with us and it's just I just got my dog of Adam's saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected\nAnd in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah pollen in the world to\nInstigate a one day like the chamber and one solution chamber once with ... and buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other\nI Would of course probably want to see it stopped at a\nSmall a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a comment in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one school tuition chamber once with Jewish and buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for us to buy a but this is a path to is the ideal\nSelection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these parliaments tried to society of friends I think we should populate out parliament with randomly selected people\nIf you don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... his recycling thoughts the perhaps surprising an overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically if it can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime yeah we have asked\nResponsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist\nThe question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get the ... assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to\nA sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the wood is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe it will spread\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddy selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge ... battle is to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it does it I'm not I think it will be easy a political changes every easy ... ah especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of
