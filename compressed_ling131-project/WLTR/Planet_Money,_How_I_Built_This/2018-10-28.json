shake like she cure and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire you know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially I\nDo naturally because men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was ... New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of all the way people are able to move on with me\nBecause I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because I mean\nThis has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm

school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to\nAnd I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\n\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter]\nSo my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize now one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach\nAnd she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still guy on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm hysterical\n[laughter] you know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with her demons right or their challenges through humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy in the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and justify telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they did\nActivist or an

I founded the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media\nAnd we always made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happen to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalk about guys are talking about several probably you know like I really just want to talk about beyond the cat [laughter] so it gets exhausting having\nTo constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life

around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required little patience [laughter]\nYeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip and again took with the other comedians they turned it into a movie called\nThe Muslims are coming in too long after he came out something happened back in New York at least one again usually felt welcomed than accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to

comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign we raised\nCampaign right the nice things about Muslims so myself fellow comedians will be dollar decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign we raised money work with the NCAA for over five months that was approved and today\nWe're supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to ban the poster citing political content let's take\nAt a couple of those posters hears one I'm a Muslim Muslims\n[noise] let's see what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe\nUs are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political but it is it it's about justice so we\nDecided to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign abiding bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying is a couple of comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWeird feeling I was like as those blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changed all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nTook a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of film or I think you're in Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nUsing comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful yeah\nSo I mean you

from the current Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nLet me just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stuff done them so why would we hold Islam to separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God\nYou know a lot of difference between the three of them do you know [noise] some credible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to be good\nBuilt to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing was performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million

humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on\nAnd so my defense mechanism was humor but I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas and thoughts and stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable in heavy because there's no sort of\nRedemptive narrative
