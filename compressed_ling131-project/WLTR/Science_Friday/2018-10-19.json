and presumed dead Saudi journalist ... continues to unfold how it's been unfolding though that's what we want to focus on right now\nSometimes gruesome details in the case appear to be coming out in a deliberate slow drip courtesy of Turkish officials they're the ones who first put out the story that ... was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nTo learn more we got in touch with Carlotta Gall assemble bureau chief for the New York times [noise]\nSo how are Turkish visual getting their information and how are they parsing out what they know well that's what so\nCarlotta Gall assemble bureau chief for the New York times so Howard took her to visuals getting their information and how are they parsing out what they know\nWell that's what's so interesting is I think they've known from the very get go I'm literally from the first day or evening\nUm what happened was that the first week the Turkish officials 'em all anonymous all asking not to be quoted started reaching out to the foreign media which was interesting because it's not usually what they do yeah so that then became a big story in the west and it was clear\nThat that was that am they want it to be listened in the west they wanted to be believed\nSo um it's been so they've been they've been cautious and careful with how they have\nReleased um what they know the details coming out by drip I'm\nIn a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when the people in charge of the scene of the crime is Saudis are not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean that's you know and and it remains this mystery in many ways\nThere's no full now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark five to one of the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings maybe came from his apple watch\nThat was quite quickly shut down by technical acts but I'm the photos that were released of the safety and Saudis who are being accused of being scored who flew in the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams and you'll and they were checking ... to try and match them with\nOpen source materials social media and stuff and so on we found people who\nAre easily recognizable for all of you know the entourage of uh\nSo on we found people who\nAre easily recognizable for all of you know the entourage of ah the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman they caught on um you know photograph news agency photograph so those are the things we never to match up there are others that it's difficult to work out who they are\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is reported to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went around by ... in your reporting have you come close to understanding this\n[noise] um no not yet I mean I think the first we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on no one this is a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked that as a threat against them against our own government and president out on himself so that's why that particularly in range die thing\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which although there's a diplomatic deference they do have differences considerable difference it\nAnd so now you see in the pro government columnists quite a lot of anger spilling out a particularly and demands that um the crown prince you remove so it's it's gone going very high\nCarlotta Gall the

but the recovery is just beginning Michael tore through the south east us last week a powerful storm likely made even more powerful by climate change\nAmong the places I took a direct hit tend to air force base in Florida to know just one of many us bases around the world that are vulnerable to be growing impacts of climate change\nBut as the world's Carolyn Beeler reports the military is not

million dollars each\nMore than a week later officials are still surveying the damage but when they're done the repair costs will not be added to any running tally of military spending related to extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the cause of climate change will be going forward\nThat's John konger he oversaw environmental policy and managed facilities for the department of defense during the Obama administration last year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking the cost of extreme weather and climate change and all their installations Brian ... wrote that recommendation for the watchdog agency\nWe think it's important to capture the distinction

up\nSevere storms so that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\nLook argues it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hanger roof if you know how much you've spent repairing hangar roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition if not supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agency is called to track climate and extreme weather costs by saying no thanks actually they did say a little more they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not warrant that time and money expended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that statement was correct\nTrevor Hauser is with the economic research company ... group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible but thanks to a lot of research work over the past few years we can do it\nScientists still don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change but they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate change or that Fifteen Percent more ... during the hurricane\nCombining that new science with big economic data lets people like how's your estimate how much climate change will cost investors insurance companies and government agencies\nRight down to a building level to estimate how much more likely it is at a given building a experience as extreme weather events now that I was Thirty years ago and how much more likely will be in the future and what the price tag of\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the militaries nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says\nNow how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says it'd be totally doable\nI mean I don't know exactly what it would cost but I'm guessing it would cost them wash

assets since they had seriously knocked him and selling to provide houses details meant they had to pay high gifts\nSo since they have seriously knocking and selling to provide houses details meant they had to pay the highest rate five here as a day or child for the school meals\nFamilies would also required to pay two hundred and ten years per child each quarter for the school bus and many obviously quota for to do so but talking about migrants will sometimes don't have a job how can afford two hundred and ten years\nSo what does this mean for immigrant kids like what were the eating at lunch and how do they go to school and how did they get home\n[noise] the thing is that before signing a low the first thing ... she's trying to figure out the consequence of that resolution and convinced they were totally aware migrant children who've been forced to eat separately from their classmates\nThat was his older load that prevents Keats from bringing their own food from home inside their class obviously was a problem for the parents because they were forced to take their kids to school in the morning\nThan some of them were taking their kids back home for lunch and then sending

out that a massive crew finding to help the migrant kids had the red you'd raise sixty thousand euros you said that a certification of assets without being enough to go out on the school meals\nThere was one left wing politician in Italy called this resolution apartheid ah how many Italians feel that way yes there is a vision is being described as an op are tied as a form of segregation\nOr that he's the feeling that we are going seriously to fire that thank you ... are now studying to seeing that you know this is probably the most far right governments in the end of the world war second in Italy for sure and maybe in ...\nYou know for kids it's never easy arriving at a new school and then you face these regulations that alienated from other classmates have you spoken with immigrant families and did they tell you how their kids are dealing with this\n[noise] I did speak to a mother you know do the she came from Tunisia and she was telling me that she fell you mediated she felt\nYou know she was angry she was seriously you know disappointed and humiliated by a low signed by politicians were totally aware of the conditions of migrants in ...\nSo they felt the was

you\nSpeaking of things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of the TV show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality talk show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who were\nWorking against the terms of of their their views in Japan and stake out people you're there with them in the car um they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggest their deport him in the next plane type bang\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or a translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called ... which I guess translate says Koch at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show it uh in Japan called title ... she can kind of which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada where I'm from for example uh we had a show like this that account of the border services agency collaborated with with the producers and actually the Canadian government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless\nAnd it was only taken off the air because of the uh it'd be contravene privacy regulations in Canada\nAnd look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless and it was only taken off the air because of the uh it'd be contravene privacy regulations in Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening and it's it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in bright and cousins so now the the immigration agents are on their way to eat\nThe dormitory words some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out and then they sort of narrative\nAnd say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there's a a camera you know you're driving down the road it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face so everything is blurt out including the like the neighborhood where it is\n'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood\nUm the people who live there would probably complain in ... create a slash and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out images you can't see people's faces voices are disguised as quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because uh the the program did to cooperate with the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they they I mean there's people have put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be somewhere PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying well\nEfforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying [noise]\nWell I mean yeah I like on line there was considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said our age rating those into the entertainment like why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it'd be of the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and in taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'm not sure like uh I think is just a kind of a ... kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody now sing [laughter]\nYeah I mean I I guess you might think also we live within time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for\nBrexit or invasion of Crimea so many people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country and so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that\nSomeone's doing something to protect us here\nNevin Tom Cindy Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling us about this a somewhat bizarre show\nOh You're welcome
