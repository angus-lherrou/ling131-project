away [noise] you know mine is of course mine never stopped\nAnyway it also means for two years out from the twenty sixteen campaign and you can believe that when then candidate Donald Trump ran on a series of promises to the American people tell the president of course is on the ballot this here but I'm the term election is kind of like those mid term tests he took back in school\nPeople tell the president of course isn't on the ballot this year but a midterm election is kind of like those mid term tests you took back in school\nFor the first real assessment of all you've done in class for the first part of the semester\nAnd they're supposed to get you ready for the big one final\nVoters use the mid term elections to send a message to the president and they take a look back at the last two years and greatest the more unhappy they are with the president\nThe more likely they vote against members of his party in November\nHappy with him they support the members of his party\nVoters evaluate how a president is doing is to look at whether he's filled the promises he made us candidate but we also know voters evaluate the president on more than just policy they look at things like leadership\nComport themselves on the job but today's episode will specifically look at what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail\nAnd whether he's comes through on those commitments\nAnd there's a lot to get into [noise]\n[noise]\nWe begin with foreign policy\nSo I Do believe that Trump has had an extremely consequential foreign policy presidency so far in ways that are often underrated by the way both by critics have his advice of orders\nThat Susan Glasser staff writer for the New Yorker\nHe has almost singlehandedly because even his own party largely does not support much of this agenda on foreign policy in particular he is more or less singlehandedly\nReorientate American foreign policy it seems to me away from me rules based or values based foreign policy and towards an extremely transactional unilateral view of the United states in the world a much more Machiavellian great powers\nThe might rule the strong do as they will kind of view of the world\nPresident Trump bran on a few key promises when it comes to foreign policy won\nDo as they will kind of view of the world\nPresident Trump bran on a few key promises when it comes to foreign policy one and the most important in all real dealings he'd put America First\nUs and become too attached a multinational relationships deals that weren't directly benefiting the U.S he also insisted that under his leadership the world would respect us again an idea premised on the false notion that the world did not respect the United states before\nAnd in my view you know that's not a realistic thing anytime your analysis of foreign policy is essentially don't pay attention to the unvarnished thoughts of the most powerful men in the world\nYou're probably going to make some huge analytical mistakes and I think that you know Trump again has been fairly consistent in certain areas of expressing preferences that are then translated as policy if you\nAgain has been fairly consistent in

more South Carolina public radio dot or [noise]\nThat's the takeaway with anti Walter from WNYC NPR I public radio international collaboration with WBAI radio and Boston [noise]\nWe continue our look at Trump's promises from twenty sixteen campaign pick up now on trade [noise]\nThen candidate Trump rent on a message and blow it up a bad deal\nWhen you look at Trump's promises from twenty sixteen campaign pick up now on trade [noise]\nThen candidate Trump rent out a message of blow it up a bad deal\nI'm going to do harm to foreign and I intend to immediately renegotiate the germs that agreement I Am going to withdraw the night it strikes from the Trans Pacific partnership and I'm going to direct the secretary of commerce you identify\nEvery violation of\nA foreign country to the current news and the harm due to the American worker\nSo how has he done you've had a very tough and very consistent in some ways anti free trade anti globalization and specifically anti China views that Trump's a candidate Trump the president to put [noise]\nThat Susan Glasser again he pulled out of the TPP the Trans Pacific partnership which was the major regional trade deal negotiated in the course of the Obama administration that was meant to be the major American and its allies response to Chinese economic and increasingly security\nA muscle flexing in the region\nThere's been no clear strategy to replace that except to engage in that ... on the economic front and here's Alex lots and lots of three sixty senior reporter on international trade\nIt's definitely true to say that he has tear fully gone about restructuring America's trade deals and I say carefully only in the sense that\nWhile you would tell you that these are historical groundbreaking rewrites of past American trade deals most people will tell you that it's a little more ... and a little more nuanced than that so let's get into that nuance most recently of course they has\nRewritten the north American free trade agreement and while it stopped\nThe net so let's get into that nuance\nMost recently of course they has rewritten be North American free trade agreement and while it stops short of I think curing all the ills of the old NAFTA that Trump ran on doing on fixing\n'em it is definitely an improvement in the sense of just people conduct business differently than they did in Nineteen Ninety four when it came into effect\nBut here's the thing to understand a lot of what they agreed to in the new NAFTA deal was already part of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement negotiated under President Obama that President Trump withdrew from\nIn Canada and Mexico we're in agreement that was considered Obama's NAFTA rewrite he also promised to rewrite NAFTA on the campaign trail in two thousand eight\nUm and that was waiting for Trump when he got there but instead of picking it up and asking Congress to pass it immediately withdrew the United states in the trade agreement he said it was terrible you never really gave specific them what he did in ... so it's a little disingenuous I think for him to say none of this happens without me and the way I impose these tariffs to apply pressure on them that's just not the case\nThe one thing that are two issues that the Trump Administration points to specifically the auto sector and on dairy and parrots or these brand new topics that the president was able to negotiate into this new NAFTA deal\nYou have touched on the to at least that are the most different now there was a lot of work done on improving dairy market access into Canada in GDP\nWe got a little bit more in this new NAFTA but it's by you know a couple of different decimal points but the automotive rules are very interesting it's Heather's tear it benefits for cars to minimum wage but at least sixteen dollars an hour and that is new that was not in the TPP\nLet's talk about terrorists early in the president's administration there was a lot of hand wringing specialist\nAn hour and that is new that was not in the TPP\nWhat's going to Paris early in the president's administration there was a lot of handwringing especially from folks on Wall street some people with in the president's administration saying\nWe gotta stop all this Paris talk the economy when great the more we talk about parents the better chance that we knock this really great economy off the rails so\nThe economy still seems to be doing quite well and the president hasn't stopped talking about terrorists does that mean the president has succeeded and using parents as a tool for getting what he wants for the U.S on trade\nYou're correct that the economy is still very robust and growing but\nI Would say and many economists will tell you that the strength of the U.S economy is what is shielding the president from the adverse effects of terrorists not it's growing because of terrorists and as far as what he was hoping to achieve it seems entirely political to me at this point we began by talking about what he campaigned on and off trade enforcement in the form of tariffs was part of that\nYou know I Will counter unfair trade practices by several partners namely China but it's it's manifested in other partners as well and that's what's happened but\nIt's not really forcing anyone to the negotiating table you know he claims that NAFTA doesn't happen without terrorists\nBut as I just laid out these are two of our closest allies they will always sit down and talk with us and asked us now basically what you're seeing is a terrorist beginning to take root and the most rapid escalation has been with China that the terrorists know coverage hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods\nAnd those are beginning to recover consumer goods the last round of tariffs started to cover home electronics computers furniture or things like that\nConventional economic theory tells you that you're gonna start to see prices raised on that and even though he can go out on the campaign trail and say you see I impose these tariffs 'cause I'm at work for you\nEconomic theory tells you that you're going to start to see prices raised on that and even though he can go out on the campaign trail and say you see I impose these tariffs 'cause I'm at work for you the forward thinking you know voter will say okay yes you did that\nWhat does it actually do for us that's sort of where we're at on terrorists here it's true that he's impose them and through that he kept to his word on that but on a broader scale I don't know that there's anything they can point to say the terrorists got you ... you know there's really no they're they're\nThe other thing the president talked a lot about as a candidate was the issue of the trade deficit and how large wise has there been a significant change in the trade deficit since he's been president\nYet a significant changes that it has actually gone up quite a bit since he's come into office it's been an interesting tight rope for critics to walk because while he said I'm working on reducing a trade deficit um it continues to climb\nBut at the same time critics also said when he made those arguments the trade deficit\nIf it's high isn't really like necessarily a bad thing for our economy in many contexts it can be the mark on the very healthy economy because consumers are embolden to buy things the Trump Administration and President Trump's himself continues to frame this as sort of a like\nA bank account right it's just like look at us losing all this money you either not understanding or willfully distorting the fact that it's actually just private companies and citizens who want to buy things with their money it's not like we're flushing money down the drain we have great purchasing power in this country and we're using it\nThe other thing the president talked to a lot about as a candidate and he still does today which is to say listen I'm a free trader I'm not anti free trade I'm just fair trade if you had to grade this president on a free trade scale where would you put him\nI mean it's it's in the ... range I don't understand\nPresident on a free trade scale where would you put him\nI mean it's it's in the ... range I don't understand how anybody could look at two years of like rapidly and largely unprecedented since the Nineteen thirties largely unprecedented escalation of of terrorists both with allies and with countries were more contentious and say\nThis is a free trade president I think that's such a foolish state to state with a straight you're a free trader\nAnd

thanks\nI'm Carol hills President Trump has negotiated lower tariffs for American dairy products going to Canada but that may not be much help to us dairy farmers we learned about the real threat to America stereo industry problem for Canadians to on the world [noise]\nThis afternoon at three\n\nSomebody said the other day\nWatched the first thing you're going to\nSwell will work immediately on repealing Obamacare [noise]\nSince the campaign President Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable CARE Act otherwise known as Obamacare Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news and host of the what the health podcast and she tells us how well he's done so far\nThe administration has done quite a bit actually sort of Congress the big thing that Congress did was in the tax bill after they were unable to pass their repeal and replace legislation they eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance to the individual mandate penalty\nThe president also cut off federal funding also for a controversial or at least a contested\nPart of the law that gave special discounts to lower income people\nFederal funding also for a controversial or at least a contested part of the law they gave special discounts to lower income people people with incomes below two and a half times poverty although in the end\nThe insurance industry was able to find a workaround for that that ended up giving not only those people discounts but some other people discounts to the other big thing the administration has done is it allowed\nDifferent kinds of insurance plans with basically lesser benefits then are required under Obamacare um they're called short term planting some they're called association health plans\nAnd the concern is that healthier people will move into these kinds of plant because they're cheaper but the problem is they don't offer very much and sometimes it's not entirely clear what they don't offer until you discover that you need something so those are sort of the big things that have happened to the law in the last year um\nPresident likes to say the law is dead and then the next breath like say but we fixed it\nAnd he also talked a lot as a candidate saying that the health care premiums are going up one point he said they're going up to forty fifty fifty five percent there's still talk from the White House and Republicans that premiums are still skyrocketing what do we know about\nPremiums on the exchanges at this point\nWell actually very interestingly premiums next year for twenty Nineteen are going to go down slightly about one and a half percent the average premium in the states that are run by the the federal government which is most of them\nWhat analysts say is that they would have gone down considerably more if not for some of the changes that the administration has made so the administration trying to have it both ways like look we made premiums go down and actually other things made premiums go down their actions made premiums mostly go up\nOther thing we see is a change in polling and perceptions of the Affordable care\nTheir actions made premiums mostly go up\nThe other thing we see is a change in polling and perceptions of the Affordable CARE Act\nBack during the campaign plurality of voters said they disapprove of the law now here we are two years later and the majority not significant but a smaller majority said that they support the Affordable CARE Act so ... how do you explain that\nI I feel like twenty Seventeen and the fight over repealing the law was basically the the marketing plan that the Obama administration never had for the law it taught people what was in it I'm basically a top people what was in it by suggesting what they were going to lose a particularly things like protection for pre existing conditions\nExpansions of Medicaid that it helped a lot of middle class people not just poor people little class people who are you know uh being expect to take care of their aging parents um their Medicaid has proved to be much more popular than I think Republicans\nRealized um so it was it goes to much more than the laws much larger than just the five percent of people who are in these individual markets buying insurance and I think people actually learned just as it was getting ready to go away that maybe these are things we actually would like to keep around\n[noise] so what happens in twenty Nineteen the Republicans have said if we keep control of Congress we're going to go at it again we're going to take another repeal vote\nYou have Democrats many of them are running this year on something they called Medicare for all saying that they are going to make that a priority should they take control of Congress should really can you help us understand what could really possibly happen in twenty Nineteen\nIt interesting that it's sort of the health debate is by for ... you know where's the Affordable CARE Act was intended to be a middle of the road moderate plan market basically\nInteresting that it's sort of the health debate is by for ... you know where's the Affordable CARE Act was intended to be a middle of the road moderate plan market basic it attracts some\nModerate Republicans which in the end they didn't but that was that was the idea now we're seeing sort of both sides going to their corners Republicans\nSaying you know yes we want to get rid of this whole thing and start over with what we don't know Democrats are saying yeah maybe this compromise thing didn't work we want to have Medicare for all single payer universal coverage\nCall it what you will but because I think people are frustrated with the state of the healthcare system right now\nEven if premiums are moderating out of pocket expenses are going up people are paying more or they perceive that they are paying more health care is simply too expensive\nAnd they're thinking that yes the Affordable CARE Act with a nice thing but people are still hurting and we need to do something more dramatic so you know what you end up with and are are are these sort of polar opposites and it's hard to see where there could be any middle ground where something could pass at least in the immediate future\nThe discussion about Medicare for all has been very active on the Democratic side\nThe president himself took to USA Today he penned an op ed where he argued that this proposal of Medicare for all is going to totally destroy Medicare as we know it for seniors\nAnd that it's basically a form of socialism what do we know about the president's plans\nFor Medicare uh especially since we know that this is a big driver of government spending and there seems to be discussion\nEvery year about its potential bankrupting the country or renting out of money so where does he seemed to be going with discussions on this\nWell I'm actually surprised that this didn't come up until now Medicare has been a a a tradition\nSeemed to be going with discussions on this\nWell I'm actually surprised that just didn't come up until now Medicare has been a a a traditional issues sort of Medicare scare tactics have been traditionally issue for Republicans in midterms um because older people tend to vote in larger numbers in midterms\nAnd this goes back to twenty ten when the Republicans were trying to undermine the Affordable CARE Act they were not so much arguing about the the parts of the law that we think of as Obamacare\nThey were arguing about all the money that the Affordable CARE Act cut out of Medicare um ironically\nIn the interim the Republicans when they got into office um said and yeah those Medicare cuts that were in the Affordable CARE Act which were mostly cuts to provider payment for beneficiaries actually got more benefits out of that law but there were reduction in payments to hospitals and doctors and\nFor a variety of other things\nAnd the Republicans decided that they were going to keep those cuts because they made sense and because they needed the money uh interestingly a President Trump's own budget recommends more cuts to Medicare again mostly to provider payments um but for the president it to then go out and bashed the Democrats for having\nCut Medicare and the Affordable CARE Act yeah that that doesn't really work for the Republicans now the argument that Medicare for all will undermine Medicare is a relatively new and this seems to be the favorite Republican line of attack it's like\nThey will not only make America you know a socialist program they will get rid of Medicare for seniors to um at least on her most of the Medicare for all bills we've seen seniors would get more benefits and have to pay less how the country could afford it is a debate that needs to be had\nBut it's a little bit of an of an odd scare tactic to say that that seniors would lose Medicare if the country went to Medicare for everybody\nTo really wrap our

weapons systems themselves named\nWe can do that these are everything from jet fighters to anti missile interceptors and an every time\nTo anti missile interceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing [noise] wow [noise] so so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that\nBasically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are only for high level hackers\nTo take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into systems of these things were just\nThat they found ... fault password hadn't changed on the software of these systems so the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by guessing password in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds\nAnd in some in many cases\nThe DOD weapons developers did not notice that the testers were in their system acting like hackers and they even didn't notice when the testers we're trying to be intentionally noisy to make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nNow to be clear these are weapons systems that are already deployed or are they things that are being developed and are going to be deployed what what kind of time period we're talking about so we are talking about\nSystems that are being developed the reason why this report was done by the government Accountability Office was at the Senate Armed forces committee asked them to look into the ah weapons that the\nJonathan Katz is the author of the big truck that went by how the world came to save Haiti and left behind a disaster he's currently a fellow

there was a lucrative market for their would funded by South Carolina Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau insurance\nI'm Carol hills with the world that new trade agreement that the U.S Mexico and Canada recently agreed on well it covers a wide range of issues but if you listen to President Trump you might think it all boils down to one thing dairy products from Canada\nThey've treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York state that a lot of other states\nVery badly the new trade deals still needs legislative approval but it would give us dairy farmers more access to Canadian markets world Jason Margolis went to Ontario to hear from farmers there\nPhilip Armstrong's family has been farming in ... Ontario for a very long time or family has been on this piece of land the since aging sixty nine obviously dairy farming has lost a lot since then it's also made\nSince Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has evolved a lot since then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduating college thirty seven years ago today each have is three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk and the computer measures they're out but\nThe caller that they have on them [noise] his id but it also measures her eating habits on an individual ... measures her room in the stomach flu is to make sure that that's going well it measures are lying down time and measures are activity\nCombined that technology with better breeding and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago this might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk\nSo to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management\nEach farm has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent that's what's enraged President Trump\nCanada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much but a role in in income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand that they don't know\nGold out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the facts I don't know and so\nIf we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got in just had that we were mistreating their farmers\nMany American dairy farmers agreed with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently re define some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada far from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices\nPeople are also consuming less milk a lot of male cat in the past has been a dumped because it couldn't be processed and in an appropriate time or sold and extreme discount Brian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin\nWell us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture we have no right to do that I I really think runs a nice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system gold says think of the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system\nThe U. S. government's sets a minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies\nUs also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour cream for instance it's I think it's I don't remember exactly as like grand Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount\nThe U.S sour cream tariffs is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us dairy tariffs on other cheeses and that you have like fifty percent\n... is one hundred and eighty seven percent and Lloyd says there are a lot of other us dairy tariffs on other cheeses and I have like fifty percent ... Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important state to the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole process\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada will make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what\nWould happen is going to hurt us here but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it all\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York farm or see things differently they're glad to have more access\nTo Canadian markets still there's an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis ... Ontario\nThis week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second Jamal ... entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul and it's not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what happened to hand\nSide to side um it is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new ... like him she lives outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even\nKingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on Saturday for the past few years have been put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and so ... has the highest profile of something that's\nBeen going on inside Saudi Arabia for more than a year now I Would say and that's the scary thing\nIs also a tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent journalism because there isn't anything called independent journalism in Saudi Arabia and so like a for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film\nThere were like how would you like to be identified argue Saudi dissidents like no I'm a journalist was covering the story but because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can say these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space and this is the problem with\nWith with how the Saudi Government is dealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even my oldest of comments and critique about their policies and so they've left no room for us\nThey've left no room for us to be able to properly Congress stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman um\nI can Lou ... absolutely on everyone's ...

um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and I believe there are about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be feeling at that part of the flight and I think that had to deal with the fact that there were\nNo longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start spinning and the goal is to a grand jury\nAnd then they're parachutes deployed to slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the earth or yeah they are [laughter]\nGod I've done what is known as a parabolic flight\nThat's when you feel weightlessness for a moment in time and during the ... experience extra jeeze and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress I didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\n[noise] are there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if\nThey've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nUs and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently\nAt the moment no us and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics inter now it definitely creeps into other aspects when Russia invaded Ukraine that\nKind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has\nHad an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in the way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting away of that\nIs significant setback for the international space station I Would say it's\nDefinitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts into orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually they got up there and a story as as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a two hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days\nInto that so there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so\nEither they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty phrase capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board\nBut that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation kinds\nLauren brushes senior science reporter for the verge thanks Lawrence thanks for having me this next story is also about Russia but guess what it has
