far which Michael told me is exceeding presidential election levels in some places [noise]\nBut we've heard about the importance of early voting before like say the twenty sixteen election so I asked ... about the danger of misinterpreting the pre election day vote\nYou know a lot of the public facing data will see the party registration of people who have already cast ballots the race or ethnicity in some states we should not assume that those are my with the groups not everybody who was registered as a Democrat in Florida or has a history of voting in the Democratic primary in state\nIs going to cast the ballot for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump prefer given Democratic Senate candidate over given Republican candidate so just looking at you know who's winning in terms of more registered Democrats are registered Republicans cast ballots has all the problems are that that you could infer the authoring worth keeping in mind especially with twenty sixteen is\nHow late movement in an election intersects with with early vote so you know the second call me a letter came out right around this time two years ago\nAnd so you know as we look at news events you know I don't know the caravan I guess and and the Republican messaging on that or or the president claiming he's going to issue a new tax cut things that we think might have some persuasive power over over voters we should remember that a significant number of votes had been cast before those events take place and\nI think that that's something that twenty sixteen should be instructive on and give us a bit of caution\nMichael is there a difference between people who show up to vote early you have states that allow you to come and vote at a certain location before election day versus those states where you can vote via the mail you get an absentee ballot sent to you\nA certain location before election day versus those states where you can vote via the mail you get an absentee ballot sent to you\nRight so when we first respond to that question you just posed which is the election forecasting question\nAnd a good weekend before the election and twenty I'm sixteen I didn't and also some of the early vote in the streets where we're we're getting higher early voting numbers\nAnd um it by and large we correctly predicted over what was going to happen and the twenty six you know watching the Vatican Colorado where we get very high levels of early voting\nCorrectly protected those are states and then a correctly predicted how Trump would have to win the election which was you would have to when I Want to do slow on early voting states like Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin He ended up running all three of them um but again I I I think there's some\nValue in the signals that we're getting from the early voting data and that really plays into the question that you asked me which is that I guess they were actually on differences in the way in which people participate or Republicans tend to vote by mail but it's not a universal truths Democrats tend to vote in person early and there's this uh\nThis pattern that you see in the early vote on as you get closer to ... that's why I'm saying right now I'm not drawing\nIn ... which is about what's happening here I think by the end of next week once we get the in person early vote in in in number of states um will be able to tell what's happened\nSocial what about early vote and the impact on some underrepresented grab thinking about butter is of color or younger people are people who\nMaybe aren't frequent voters is there any evidence or anything that you're seeing in terms of campaign strategy that is aimed at using the early vote to get those voters engaged in the election\nDefinitely democratic campaigns that that are focusing either mobilization strategies see\nThose voters engaged in the election\nDefinitely democratic campaigns that that are focusing either mobilization strategies see early voting as far more friendly to the to the sort of lifestyles and calendars and you know are developing refining get out the vote tactics\nThere's been a sort of culture of of plan making which is a tool that that comes out of uh the behavioral sciences get people to visualize how they're going to get to the polls what time they're going to go how they're going to get there um some campaigns calling people back or sending them a reminder of the plants that they had made as more sort of paths open up for people to vote\nThe thinking is that it is more conducive to the lifestyles of of people who may have multiple jobs are are going to school at odd hours you know and I think that there are a lot of opportunities with very targeted digital advertising to take advantage of of this sort of\nLonger window and the knowledge in some cases about who's voting who hasn't run really tailor campaigns at the voters are still outstanding\nAnd Michael if you can you know kind of think into the future down the road maybe ten years or more is this what we're going to be doing that election day itself is just one day on the calendar and that majority of people voting in this country are going to vote before the election even happens\nAnd and that's the way we used to build a long time ago a factor\nFor Eighteen forty five and we said the uniform day after voting\nElections were over ... days and that was to allow people the opportunity to travel from rural areas into the county courthouse to vote on and so this is nothing new editor for our time in our history of our country and then we started doing it for a while and we started ... starting the\nNineteen seventies onstage started liberalizing dinner or early voting hours to permit first I'm\nNo excuse absentee voting that we saw permanent absentee voting and so many um voters were voting by mail in states like Oregon\nUm no excuse absentee voting that we saw permanent absentee voting and uh so many um voters were voting by mail in states like Oregon and Washington that the election officials they're\nJust sort of threw up their hands and said why are we having these polling locations open they're very expensive I was just moved on the ballot elections and so on that trend started out west a and now we've got\nThree states you hold on a milk powder lessons\nWe've got a California are coming online an option for the Allen Institute is there some test runs this time around but by twenty twenty wishes he mentioned were counties in California that are on a ballot jurisdictions places like New Jersey and ah and toward it you know two states that I Would say that we're going to see more and more male balloting and\nThat's going to do against gene eventually again to perhaps on el Balad elections you can go to a vote center like a sort of like a Super Bowl and ... and a and vote in person that you wish to do so so it's not just a an\nAll male about elections the other innovation that's happening in West Virginia that were notary voters are allowed to vote by an app\nOn and so will monitor and see how that works this time around\nUm but that's most of our voting innovations have come through the military first so on that something should be looking over in the next ten Twenty years to other states are adapting adopting a a a an\nFor ah for military voters and and do they start offering that option a to a

about how huge sums of money in this year's elections are affecting early voting and voter turnout will also look at whether Trump supporters will come out in large numbers when the president isn't on the ballot\nYou've seen those numbers bounce around a little bit I think he's you know he's negatives aren't that much different than they were when he won that election book now obviously it's a different context as we're talking about um internal election was not on the ballot\nWhat's happening in states like Georgia\nQuestions about voter purges risk disenfranchising thousands of voters all

Carolina public radio dot org [noise]\n[noise] so far\nPosters and pundits started looking at the large early voting numbers as one indication of the energy on the left and on the other side president

Democrat don't bother [noise]\nPresident Trump's not on the ballot and so the question is will the enthusiasm at his rallies translate to Republicans up for election this year\nPresident certainly hope so he's already held more than a dozen rallies\nThe enthusiasm at his rallies translate to Republicans up for election this year\nPresident certainly hope so he's already held more than a dozen rallies if not including one earlier this week in Wisconsin state he won by a single point twenty sixteen\nHe's a great guy scotch opponent\nIs it extremely liberal\nRepublican Governor Scott Walker isn't a tight race against Wisconsin schools superintendent Tony Evers\nEarly for Scott Walker\nAnd whatever the outcome of the election this fall you can bet people will look to it as a bellwether for twenty twenty I spoke with Craig Gilbert the Washington bureau chief for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel to Trump's visits will energize those twenty sixteen voters to turn out for Scott Walker\nI've been thinking about you know the cost and benefits of the Trump visit and obviously it makes a certain amount of sense for him not to go to the suburbs of Milwaukee and I have to go to Madison or Milwaukee but to go to a place like ... where he did well\nIn twenty sixteen but even in a place like why are you going to a place like central Wisconsin when you look at his polling numbers it's kind of fifty fifty and this is again the more conservative leaning rural part of the state so\nHe's not it's not like he's more popular than Scott Walker in these places but I guess the thinking is that if he can mobilize a certain group of Republican conservative voters and I've talked to some people like this on the campaign trail that are pro pro Trump and there may be a little tapping on longer um then maybe that's worth it\nWhat do you see as the reason that Trump's overall approval rating is not as high in Wisconsin as it was as we were moving into the twenty sixteen election and right after the twenty sixteen election\nWisconsin's one of those states were Trump's numbers we never very good and clearly\nWas that we were moving into the twenty sixteen election and right after the twenty sixteen elections\nWisconsin's one of those states were Trump's numbers we never very good and clearly\nThe difference in Wisconsin was the voters that didn't like either candidate meaning Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump broke pretty decisively for Donald Trump at the end so\nThey were always a lot of Trump voters that were very conflicted and had mixed feelings in some cases they just dislike Hillary Clinton more than Donald Trump so\nYou've seen as numbers bounce around a little bit I think he's you know he's negatives aren't that much different than they were when he won that election but now obviously it's a different context because we're talking about um a term election where he's not on the ballot\nHe's numbers or got a little bit better for example in the last big statewide poll\nThey're still in the forties they've kind of bounced around from the low forties to the mid forties but by any poll a you'd have to say that you know Scott Walker is a little more popular than Donald Trump or a little less popular than Donald Trump I'm so again there's started that mystery of what Trump does for Walker [noise]\nA lot of what I heard after the twenty sixteen election about Wisconsin was you had\nTwo things going on one very energized Republican base especially small town rural ... that we haven't really paid much attention to because we spend so much time thinking about Milwaukee and Madison and the area around Milwaukee but the second was that liberal voters voters of color either stayed home\nOr are they cast a third party ballot do you think first of all is that a fair assessment of twenty sixteen\n[noise] well I think um which is one of those places where you can find examples are of\nGreat democratic turnout and soft democratic turnout and the classic contrast would be kind of mad at Madison area where everybody votes and everybody's going to vote this fall and they're going to vote just gets blue or bigger all the time and it's overwhelmingly democratic and nobody thinks that\nBuddy votes and everybody's going to vote this fall and they're going to vote just gets blue or bigger all the time and it's overwhelmingly democratic and nobody thinks that that's not going to happen Milwaukee has a much bigger question mark because you have\nA bigger ... a minority population and Milwaukee has a history of dropping off in mid term elections in terms of turnout in that matter you know differently mattered and twenty sixteen I mean the big change statewide was the small towns\nI mean there are sort of two kinds of communities there and that that swing was so decisive so much the story that twenty six election but you've got the Republican small towns and then he got the ... the small towns and there were like\nMore than five hundred communities in Wisconsin that voted for Obama twenty twelve and voted for Trump at twenty sixteen so those places\nThere is an element there are just swinging is\nYou know one of the things that I remember looking at right after the election was suburban Milwaukee Walker shot county which is traditional Republican area\nBut this was a kind of place where we had heard stories I'm sure you'd written many of them about the conflict in suburban voters suburban women who are upset about the Access Hollywood tape and Trump did not do as well and walk a shot as Mitt Romney did but Hillary Clinton didn't do any better than Obama did\nDo you think that's changing now we hear so much now about suburban women especially in these more affluent areas do you expect to see that walk a shell behaves differently this year\nWell this is a fascinating question because there's there's cross currents really interesting cross currents there because\nYou know the suburbs in Milwaukee are a little different than the suburbs and a lot of other cities that size they're they're pretty Republican they have a real ripple and again we're talking about and some get many cases college educated voters higher income voters they do have this very Republican history that's unusual in a national context\nAnd so here comes Donald Trump and they didn't like them in the primary they kind of under perform for him in the general election\nUsually when a national context and so here comes Donald Trump and they didn't like him in the primary they kind of under perform for him in the general election but at the same time again that's been the heart of Walker strikes in his election so you got Walker pulling them one way Trump pulling them another way\nAnd I was very interested to look at those numbers in the mid term elections because against Trump's not on the ballot but again there there are people that clearly Republicans that have qualms about Trump\nAt the same time there's like this part isn't poll in a lot of these communities and they're very ... they're very active politically engaged and they have this history of just jumping into these kind of political wars with both feet and if Republicans want to\nTry to offset you know the the pretty big numbers and come out of Madison and Dane County they need a pretty robust vote out of these Republican out or Republican suburbs of Milwaukee\nSo great that being said is there a Trump effect in this election\nWill it's there it's but it's not something that the candidates are spending all their time talking about I mean that even the Democrats I think they see it as something that's a given and so they don't need to organize their\nTV ads around trying to tie Scott Walker to Donald Trump and also by the same token you know Scott Walker's always had this kind of awkward relationship with Trump they ran against each other droplet beat up on Walker\nBut Walker is very aware that Trump is popular with Republican voters so whenever he kind of distance themselves from Trump policy it teaches at very carefully so yeah it's there it is the elephant in the room and a lot of ways\nThank you for joining

Know standing voted it is a campaign geared toward native populations in the U.
