I'm resuming my journey across the country sharing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I traveled to Buffalo New York along Lake Erie were the sky was cloaked in a constant gray missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the color believes the forecast\nWe're the sky was cloaked in a constant gray missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves the forecasts was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even caused where a long sleeve shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself I was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years and there have was filled with stuffed animals\nThey line the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and the monkey was attached to the steering wheel these are my co pilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys\nShe goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really think the name made me a bit of a tomboy when I was younger they don't say tomboy anymore now everybody is filled with gender fluids\nI guess I was ahead of my time but anyway I'm all girl now and everyone still calls me Charlie after growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because they wanted to go to the hottest\nPlace I could find but it turns out I'm not built for the desert seems more like a place for lizards people to stay there too long start to look like us funds that was left out in the sun\nShe came home after school and it's been in Buffalo ever since we have a lot of moisture here and I love it I'm like a plant water me and I grow when it's not raining it's snowing and when it's not doing either we can count on in the midst from Niagara

for a bar if you're looking for a bar or tavern buffalo is a good place to look they have a lot of them and last call his four AM they say that staying up to open later gives the snowplows time to clear your way home [noise]\nI entered what looked like one of the older bars in the city covered in lights and years of signed coasters stuck to the walls to kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place that so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and then grab while he worked\nHe said that he's been in this bar for Thirty years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell thing who knows maybe it's me they smell\nEagerly place my order there's something great about eating food that makes a city famous\nIn addition to whatever natural elements are involved the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and as corny as it might sound the love the people add makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from home for so long that you started professing your love for a plate of deep fried chicken wings\nI have\nChris had a big hartfield laugh his kids are grown in just him and his wife down the kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking I don't understand what everybody's after I mean\nSo the kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking\nI don't understand what everybody's after I mean sure moving to another city might get you a little more money but when

that's been gunning for us but we refuse to lose to a team whose name isn't even a little funny it might be a different story if it was the Likud he splits\nAmong the trophies was a faded newspaper article featuring a high school football team there was a picture of Chris he was the captain last year they won the state championship\nThis was a different life it's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day have you ever started to tear up about a bartenders glory years only to realize it was just your eyes watering from a plate of piping hot buffalo wings [noise]\nAnd boy

sweating from your bald spot [noise]\nStumbled outside to get some air and the first snowflakes were starting to fall the first snow falls like a visit from your family who you're happy to see before they hang around\nAir and the first snowflakes were starting to fall the first snow falls like a visit from your family who you're happy to see before they hang around too long and become difficult\nI
