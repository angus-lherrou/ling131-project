Thirteen I just find that's interesting so you do the cool show on Comedy Central which has show built around\nObviously we know this is a character driven show but I\n... in the comedy world there were a lot of people doing characters everyone was really doing a lot of self reverential comedy talking stories from their lives\nI mean in a way that just seem like much easier than doing character not if you don't want to share who you really are\nWith an auto [laughter] never be able to\nKeep those walls [laughter]\nBut I'm just wondering when you were pitching this I assume Comedy Central was like what do you have and you're like I Want to do this character driven show yes we're the great this is different nobody's doing All right they were they were actually very cool\nI assume Comedy Central was like what do you have and you're like I Want to do this character driven show yes we're the great this is different nobody's doing\nAll right they were they were actually very cool I had done a bunch of sketches on line and we'd put out like Bobby bottles service in\nA\nSense of the early ... I don't know if we had an e oh hello on line at that point but we had done a bunch of stuff and so uh and I did a special for Comedy Central called thank you very cool which is about the response that it\nDeserves a\nAnd it was sort of become a backdoor pilot four of the cruel\nShow I we were very specifically wanted to do character driven comedy I think I've always been drawn to people are trying to make people I don't like in real life\nSomehow sympathetic mhm\nAnd I don't know what that says about\n... uh my uh inner world\n[laughter]\nSo the character that you in general any play and oh
