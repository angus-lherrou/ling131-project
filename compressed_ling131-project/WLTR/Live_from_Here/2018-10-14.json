I'm at a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present\nIn our household and so I was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in you know actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who is a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that didn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to

a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story um luckily I\nThought maybe my voice could be an asset you're up in some way because\nEspecially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and on different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the experience of millions\nUm I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not that we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll
