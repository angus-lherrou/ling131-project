I'm Sam Sanders it in a minute [noise] today on the show we're taking a break from the news to focus on just one day from this past week Tobar eleven\nThat was national coming out day this year is the thirtieth anniversary of that day and a thing I always think every year around this time is it never just one day coming out happens differently for every one of the more than once and for some of us it seems like the process never really is a\nCase in point my friend Bob Mondello film critic for NPR's all things considered how old are you Bob I turned Seventy next year shut up no really so okay what year did you come out\n[noise] that's a hard question to answer do you mean to myself do you mean to my folks to you mean to my friends do you mean I I ... it depends what you're talking okay well\nYou see what I'm saying I today on the show we're going to explore the history of coming out and coming out that I was how it came to be how it's changed over time\nAnd what it means for the algae beat GQ community to them back when Bob grew up in the sixties you could get locked up for even going to a gay bar it was a very different times so Bob's first coming out actually wasn't until Nineteen Seventy four after he just had his first same sex experience\nBy told his best friend who he thought might also be gay\nI was in his apartment and it took me forever to work up to her I I was [noise] are sitting there and [noise] I just take a deep breath and I was trembling [noise] um but what I said was I'm gay\nI acted him to say so am I\n[noise] um but what I said was I'm gay\nI acted him to say so am I fall into my arms and what he actually said was\nTwice in one week who [laughter] well that was\nMy reaction how dare somebody else beat me to this um but at an event you know when I was coming out we didn't have a models\nPublic discourse there were no models for gay people on the generous hadn't come out of a TV [noise] and ah the will and grace was far in the future and so um I think it's a different world than I I hear about people coming out at the age of twelve and I think\nCould lower I was never that brave I mean you never in the world and I don't really know what it would be like today to do that\nOctober eleventh in March the one year anniversary of that big march march she said it was born out of intense activism by the LDP chi chi community over the age ... and the government indifference to the crisis someone different that President Ronald Reagan\nDidn't even say the word aids in public until September Nineteen eighty five that was a few years after the federal government first acknowledge the disease\nIt was a hard time to be gay and hard times come out but not quite ten years later America would witness maybe the biggest coming out story it it seems to be\n[noise]\nLike when you're going to try to come\n\nComing out in Nineteen Ninety seven what changed since then plus more with professor Marci Gallo after break I'm Sam Sanders you're

week we're talking about national coming out this past Thursday October eleventh we're looking at some big moment in coming down history and hearing the stories from listeners I've been talking to\nMarcy Galloway she's a professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas just talking to me through the history of coming out and you can't really talk about that in without talking about this one big moment yeah\nIt was a big deal uh she took a big big big risk and we'll her a lot that Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on her ABC sitcoms\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI remember this year I was like\n[noise]\n\nI remember in the year I was like Thirteen ... and I remember I don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch\nWow that make the ... and I and I probably thought later it's not just to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out on her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah [laughter]\nOh God I remember that that old I remember right [laughter] right\nExactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody you know that I I click with\nAnd obviously you didn't click with Richard has there ever been any one you sell to click with\nAnd what was his name citizen [noise]\nThey both on the young too much time [laughter]\nI don't know I guess I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen no normal\nI mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house the picket fence you know a donned the cat Sunday barbecues someone to love someone who loves me something I can build a life with just\nI just want to be happy and you think you can have these things with a woman well\nSociety has a pretty big problem with it you know there are a lot of people out there who think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades and run the backlash that she face was pretty it can last a show all these conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show ABC actually put an adult content\nYou know she lost a show August conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show NBC actually put an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman [noise]\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine area and I'm so in April Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear it\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the gay characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that\nBut not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best to present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids\nOr you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue or the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible ...\nWhile while [noise] it's so funny she says there's an agenda to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah very yeah there is a point on\nThe whole he'd have kids it's okay you can try to um it was fascinating to hear it 'cause that's of course what they were terrified about it it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um [noise]\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly\nAnd can I jump ... and I know we're going decade by decade I'll do it go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it I'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh\nIs wind up here um and he said\nMatt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh is white appeared um and he sets off a brain blow flag waving firestorm really of protest when he says\nDon't come out you say people right quick people stopped coming out in the ... gone from Nineteen Ninety seven Ellen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm don't do it academic saying don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay so for one\nAnd this is debatable America is is a quote\nAmerica's a safer place in twenty Seventeen hate on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nI'm paraphrasing he's you know we have to proclaim our sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it they don't whereas right heterosexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out\nOr no one should make the heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people and that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now you know ... you think of the R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and she came out but he never used the word gay right you know you think about Jodie Foster Amos the kind of came out\nGlobes we actually have tape of that\nBut I'm just getting started out there right loud and so on underneath your support on [noise]\nI'm just going to put it out there right loud and proud right so I'm underneath your support on [noise]\n\nI already did my coming out about a thousand years ago back in the\nAnd [noise]\nOpen up the trust of friends and family co workers and then gradually proudly to everyone who knew her everyone's you actually\nBarely I'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life without press conference or fragrance enterprise I\nHave a point in my mind go should have a point and should we be forced should anybody be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be coming out yeah and\nSee this is where we go back to it being both a personal any political choice\nI think the personal has to come first and I think that you do you and I know the the list of celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know about\nAnd you really want to come out and who flirt with it much like first it did um and then for whatever reasons whether it's Tamil you'll\nUm whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know they decide not to or they don't yet or they wait or whatever and I think I think there's got to be room for that too I Do I care more about whether people get in a way of social change or eight and\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from life on life's

S. dot ORG\nYou're listening to it's been a minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders [noise] this past Thursday October eleventh was a dirty national coming out day [noise] mark that day we are exploring coming out [noise] that was never just one day\nAnd how it's different for different people born in in this next segment you'll hear a gay slur I've been talking with e Patrick Johnson you the head of the African American studies department at Northwestern university and he told me how coming out can change when you're from a marginalized background\nI'm Talking about black people are brown people but there's people whoever\nWhere you live a gay life\nBut you don't talk about it and maybe there isn't a coming out day where you tell everyone [laughter] folks know and and and like other folks don't [laughter] this feels to me to be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white am I right\nYeah yeah and yeah and if you are already hailed as and you feel and the bike in terms of your rights or a black person I like the next person Asian person and that brings with a whole set of responses\nTo who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have any choice but to live with that because you you can hide it and I\nIn some ways don't have any choice but to\nLive with that because you you can hide it and I especially feel that way I'm for African Americans in particular because of the\nConnection to the church mhm you couldn't go to any black church in the United states and not find\nA game in ... a whole ... of them yes\nUm and it's a complicated place because I grew up in the church and the church is actually where I feel I came into my own\nOr work I mean like I felt safe there like as a young black boy in the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of correct but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit mhm there was this weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there\nYeah I mean the church is where I was encouraged to um express myself which you know I was a big old clean love 'em and and the choirs than a singing soprano the only way over the parental section\nI'm sure that ended up I'm sure they loved it they should be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age 'cause you sent ... ... not in my church of God okay [laughter] but many charges were doing many a absolute and still do\nAnd ... and so yeah it it's a really a\nConcert we're safe yeah no but that's that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low phenomena and also we should stop to define what the down low is for those who might not know\nSo men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not attend a fight as gay and they're usually black\nWho might not know he has so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not attend a fight as gay and they're usually black and only allowed to jail for men other than black men yes I'm even though that's not true [laughter]\nWell I mean like ... for like white man they but they don't learn another life you know the lead a double life yeah why does it say about what coming out has become where you move from Harvey\nMilk in the seventies to coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time this subset of the community black men still being labeled with this term deal\nSo at the same time that yes there was a part of the community that we're not being open there was another part that was actually being\nVery open Jay in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of a black and a lot to next lesbians\nWere open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing of pushing back against the second wave feminist movement\nWas white straight middle class women and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lowered a Sheree morale God Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these jak lesbians yeah and like lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history has not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThe uh in total some make that decision but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat's always can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on a riot there another listener who shared a coming out story with us on a as twenty five from Plymouth, Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago and he came out to family and friends as clear\nTheir parents reacted okay not great but okay but he has a second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nI was in college and I in one of my classes um my professor had brought in a kind of trans she was a gentleman who is just like kind of sharing her story ... guys like raised to be only strong and like no softness and\nUm and I've always felt like something was wrong but like compensated by being like in the military and I got a wife and kids and like all this stuff and um and I never gave myself face to really like\nMyself and really like think about\nWho I Am [noise] and it's like have you back in my chair and I always did that in class and I'm I'm just kinda mulling over another like giving yourself a space yourself [noise] never done that before\nInteresting and sort of put his myself that question I was like okay well I Am I on it and I like almost fell out of my chair [laughter] because I like the answer was no [noise]\nRecently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy eyes parents got really hung up on that\nSame kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is\nTop surgery a double mastectomy and his parents got really hung up on that\nSame kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an authentic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't know I have I and everybody like things about their body which there are like\nMake our way through life and we just have to land lovers house and it was like well there's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean dissociative with your with like a body part and like\nI don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I kind of made it clear that like it\nDoesn't matter if you understand or not but like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor my money on that and that was something like [noise]\nYeah the other day and we'd like that are good night and then as the going after that and my dad called out I after me and say I again tonight and thanks for being yourself\n\nI mean maybe not never really under stand in that but [noise] I'm Still their cat and um yeah and we still love each other\n[noise] [noise]\nThat was on a ride in Minnesota their story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Alan did Twenty one years ago professor ... Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to\nLike Janelle Monday is an example because she didn't come out as gay uh it was something much more fluid and I think we're in a moment of transition is and gender non conforming ... that is really influencing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "city": "Columbia", "day": "13"}
