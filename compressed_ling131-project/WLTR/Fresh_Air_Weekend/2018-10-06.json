that is true that is true also here with a sell your business correspondent for NPR guessing here we've been pretty busy as well ... maybe\nWell I'm so glad you made the time to talk with me to wrap up the week of news and I'm so glad to be playing the song with a plan for you both are right now it is a new well old but new\nPrince song is called Seventeen Days\nFeel like I'm already ready for the weekend just listening for the\nRight that\nWas during the voice on the\nYou said this is from an album of old prince demos that was released late last month the album is called\nPiano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three and it's these nine and released prints demos from way back then\nAnd so the thing about this is that like these aren't they\nKnow like I'm already ready for the weekend just listening for the\nRight\nOne or the voice on the\nSo this is from an album of old prince demos that was released late last month the album is called\nPiano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three and it's these nine and release prince demos from way back then\nAnd so the thing about this is that like these aren't the like finished versions of these songs due to the demos a scratch tracks just print at the piano playing the songs to show his band and his team how they want to do the songs with the full band later and they're just really interesting moment and Nissan and\nCan hear we're prince starts to beat box to basically show the drummer how he wants to Trump's this town\nAmazing so but what's so weird about this that like because these are demos there are big questions as to whether or not\nReleased right who also famously fought streaming services like YouTube and spot of five so the fact that you can hear these songs on those platforms\nIt's weird I feel guilty here in this stuff but also by that yeah I mean I think that that's one of those things it's sort of like your journalists to instinct is like yes we want to see that yeah it's\n'em and did you know what the federal\n'em and did you know what the federal minimum wage is it seven dollars and twenty five ... oh my God\nOkay um so this is much higher than that it's like double it's\nRemarkable to me I mean thinking how how long it's been since I had my first job and\nIt hasn't changed that law change and actually I remember it was five something when I was just starting out and then uh yeah bumped to seven while I was still like an adolescent but it's been there for a long yeah so my question the arena is like\nIs it fair or unfair that I saw this news from Amazon and said\nOh well it's also a PR ploy you know they've had some critique of their business practices how they treat employees they've had some critique over the fact that Jeff Bezos is so rich while their employees are making some eleven dollars an hour is is the thing that Amazon had to do for some good PR as well\nI think the PR convenience or element to this to give you an example\nSenator Bernie Sanders has spent many years battling for a higher wages for minimum wage workers and hatch\nAnd finding Amazon like he's been coming out for a while\nTo reduce the bill that's called stop basis act a you know that know enough to fit [laughter] yeah and\nRich while their employees are making some eleven dollars an hour is is the thing that Amazon had to do for some good PR as well\nI think the PR that convenience or element to this to give you an example Senator Bernie Sanders has spent many years battling for a higher wages for minimum wage workers and hatch\nAnd fighting Amazon like he's been coming out for a while now introduced a bill that's called stop basis act a you know that no one of ... [laughter] yeah\nAnd on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's\nYes PR is definitely part of it and another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bump in um coverage of that I'm sure it\nCan't hurt up some attract workers while I can talk about Amazon all day as you know I mean look at it\nStarted to sign for break or when we come back I'm going to talk with two high school students in Texas and their friends nominated them to be on the home of course ah but they're both young women and they're set up a bit of a firestorm and later my conversation with film director I Baron holds\nHe turned his politically charged Thanksgiving dinners into a comedic thriller that we all can relate to you're listening to it's been a minute for NPR we'll be right back [noise]\nI can talk about Amazon all day as you note Lena uh-huh\nSite it's time for break up when we come back I'm going to talk with two high school students in Texas and their friends nominated them to be on the ... ah but they're both young women and they set up a bit of a firestorm and later my conversation with film director Ike Baron holds\nShe turned to his politically charged Thanksgiving dinners into a comedic thriller that we all can relate to you're listening to it's been a minute for NPR we'll be right back [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the corporation for public broadcasting and the state of Jim Crow was the question serves as an enduring investments in the future of public radio from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the corporation for public broadcasting and the state of John crock who's ... serves as an enduring investments in the future of public radio\nFrom Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more at Americans for the arts dot org\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nWe are back you're listening to it's been a minute from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was here with two gas this week Chris guiding her legal editor at buzzfeed news and Alina Selyukh business correspondent for NPR a I have a question for you both\nBe honest do either of you remember your home coming from high school well I've only been to\nOne because I was an exchange student so I remember it extremely vividly but it was also sharing confusing because I had never known that such an event existed it was very strange\nUh-huh Chris I think I went [laughter] I was\nSaying closeted gay boy in Youngstown, Ohio um I went with a girl and I know I went to like I'm coming in ... but they were not at the notable a life moments that\nAre for some others I'm bringing up homecoming because it's a subject this week uh are long distance call [noise]\nThere's there's you know long distance is a segment where we call up someone somewhere in the ...\nNever known that such an event existed it was very strange uh-huh Chris\nI think I went I was I wouldn't have closeted gay boy in Youngstown, Ohio um I went with a girl and I know I went to like home coming in from but they were not at the notable or life moments that\nThey are for some others I'm bringing up homecoming because it's a subject this week of our long distance call [noise]\nThere's there's you know long distance is a segment where we call up someone somewhere in the world and talk with them about the news\nSo this week I talked with two students from Austin high school in my home state of Texas are their names are Sicilia McBride and story ... ...

gender the titles in the homecoming contest no ... no queens everyone on the homecoming court would\nJust be known as quote royals but that didn't make the show and story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward part it's another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just reading and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you are voting tricks you regard ... pasture whether or not they were down the chain\nA queen or anything between and it was up to

they're not a very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat originally basically saying that we're not we're not we're now Frank miraculously special treat ball and that that is exactly
