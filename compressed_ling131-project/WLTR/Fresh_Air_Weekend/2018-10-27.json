[laughter]\nRight let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy\n... [laughter] All right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy\nMovies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up each other\nBe miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girls private love letters were mysteriously males to all of our crushes I think it's really cool that you think I have called inspectors in my eyes\nTo letters around [noise] then there was this\nOther one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her strange father\nGot credibly drunk at night and I blacked out because [noise]\nDoes ... do the funding\nAbout all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up\nTo all the boys I've left before and like father have you watched any of those movies very okay which to I watched um celebrate that lived before of course so good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely\nFeel retro about that and I feel I feel like it stokes a particular part of my heart same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other ... just on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get the scribe has to watch comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love knife a and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yeah so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so iconic\nMillions of people watch these movies across the world is ... eighty million people yeah so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of a lot of very closely\nHer name is Gwen I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nHey going how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having names are very excited yet I have been counted\nOut for several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer\nI Know you didn't even now [noise] um\nThey called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nUh yeah the summer of love was like a menu of wrong come movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer a dad as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million\nViewers watch and it's not even number of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four\nOr five times a piece you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching his rom coms [laughter] my big question and first question about all of this was like what\nLed Netflix no or think that rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take the rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix say well this might work for us\nI think they just spied on completely underserved market you know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre and and comic book critics shoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible an infinity\nSequels and genre and comic book club last shoots\nYeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want like just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you were kind of out of luck\nSo for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also tagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or\nThey've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them yeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters widely left welcomes\nWrit large I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more busily in dollars back\nGym with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just put the ground with anybody like this one was on trouble up next why not [laughter] but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and it tanked and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back and it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband than to go on to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more\nGirls reruns again it's not a big deal but then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms genre and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars and see a lovely couple ended up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that God or\nShould we expect movie studios big movie studios that are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more rom coms an actual movie theaters\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company family owned
