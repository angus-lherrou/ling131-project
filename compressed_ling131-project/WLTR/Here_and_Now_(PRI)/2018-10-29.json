education\nThe law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death for young Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans are best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for a national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different well I think that\nDifferent for a national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are\nAre a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city not that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the state but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well I'm I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take into place too and also school history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to\nTranspose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center a school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a\nYou know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look in and see that there are lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nGot a teacher training there and other tools so willing people that here in our data word but an example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school wasn't like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh ...\nTo implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school especially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and\nJust general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's ah got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the\nThe structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people\nLive with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment so this night also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education\nAnd that you know there's opposition there are teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response senator look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology went on one we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give up\nThe different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point where you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just a normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's ... the CEOs and nonprofit mental health association of New York state what are the
