G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah like the wind is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMight the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nOr a let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals or are you telling me\nWhich would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to lead how it's ... it's my turn ... and they get outraged by measuring the get out it's my time you're going to get shot out of its okay here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he's leading the nation are if so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes\nAnd take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it with you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but ah you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them\nIs that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or what are people what's on their minds\nWhat seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um\nA lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd ah because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you\nWell at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNo uh governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal at Ohio\nAnd that is a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good opportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on\nUs joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you representatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plain menu\nThe governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you\nRepresentatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven Macs a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning\nThe plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta investigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash\nJoining us now says Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people\nAre saying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nMore than that something perhaps to do\nWith air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know if that played into this you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going\nYou could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that is happening in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crash of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight more for seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issue some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilot\nMuch cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly in the pilots\nOr you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll tell you that flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new are planted flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out or nothing and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max aid is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nOf flying you know for that matter
