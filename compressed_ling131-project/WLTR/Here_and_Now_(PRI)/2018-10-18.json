important strategic\nAlliance of the United states so we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us to talk about that as far as that host of the podcast full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S import from Saudi Arabia\nBut that's about Thirteen million dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a now about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments in the U.S shale patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nThese are the two biggest foreign holders of U.S government's securities they could if they wanted kind of hold as hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis they really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very threatened by too strong a dollar\nSo it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nImportant part of the

president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars of arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard this from a a fan

billion dollars is huge and they don't mean a lot of um jobs and I don't think a lot of money coming to our coffers and uh\nIt's not something that you don't want to blow up willy nilly\nSo Pat Robertson they're telling President Trump maybe not to go too tough on the Saudis if it is found that they have something to do with a ... death\nSaudi Arabia is still counts for less than one percent

[noise]\n\n[noise] Mm [noise]\n\nYou know when I said Bobby McFerrin on vocals I was waiting to find out what that meant exactly but there you have that he's not singing necessarily it but he is a humming along to the to the tin\nBobby McFerrin as being Bobby ... and I think it's a fascinating arrangement other for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string queen tests this is one simple minuet from one quintet so there's a lot more there to explore\nHe was writing these for the younger brother of the Spanish king dome Luis ... and a while he was doing it he was writing string quartets for royalty and playing the additional cello himself so he was doing this so that he could play along with them and then he would also right\nString queen tests for depression king who was a cellist\nSo he had a lot of opportunities to write string queen tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music [noise]\nWhat do we know about what influenced ... who influenced him\nWell he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player he and his father were playing and orchestras and you realize that he couldn't make a living just by being\nHis father was a double bass player he and his father were playing in orchestras and you realize that he couldn't\nMake a living just by being a cello virtuoso they had to compose music so he began to compose music and he ends up\nGetting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kind of music and that seemed to influence he's writing chamber music rather than say ... at the time well\nLet's get to another uh for ... and this is the cello concerto in gene major performed by the Canadian ... orchestra and on her bills ... on the chosen dusted by gene ...
