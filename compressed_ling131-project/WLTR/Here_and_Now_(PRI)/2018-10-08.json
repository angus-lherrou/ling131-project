all to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians secondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand and fourteen or two\nAnd a third Lynn importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no question that the who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed on the other side\nWe should say

that not be a priority I\nI'm not costing any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians are not being protected them to come up to the war has breached the basic the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the who the side independent un\nInquiries have produced\nExtensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides and this is a crisis that now I came away saying that the world needs to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and

four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere'd been a cake party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so we ... them into the museum\nThat guard was ...\nThey came

some kind of a day job kind of thing\nTo supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nYou know at night time when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read and I could bring my horn and practice I was always happy to say yes to filling um\nYou to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little

know at night time when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read I could bring my horn and practice I was always happy to say yes to filling in\nRandy doesn't recall any special training or specific instructions for the night shift beyond the requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries\nOn all the florists during his round he did that by swiping magnetic strapped he wasn't originally on the schedule to work the night after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reported they called in sick\nEdited told him about the carriage hats alarm but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to a ... at the watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston

answer\nSo cups or on\nMy hands are behind my back and then duct tape starts going\nOn around my eyes so about the time that he begins putting the duct tape on he says this is a robbery and so then everything was finally crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and then suddenly it made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why ... what is going to your mind when suddenly duct tape is going on in your head\nIt's very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise] um but they were immediately
