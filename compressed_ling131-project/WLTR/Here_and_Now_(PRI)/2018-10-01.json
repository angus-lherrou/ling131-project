believe\nThe wrong thing this increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is that you notice that divided front gel sense it could very easily spark off again on the streets but\nThe

little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it isn't solved deep fry at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you start a fire but you want to hear my\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm us up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that

I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved deep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire\nStarted a fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk walk is the ideal shape for holding the oil knows flattering it's got the high sides\nYou want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I have my walk I also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nHad about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Crisco you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix and I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there\nI can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh no no it's down to two hundred and I'm always adjusting to tape it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk that fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch alright would be good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good butter milk so\nIt's getting close to four hundred or oh no no it's down to two hundred and I'm always adjusting to tape it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some butter mill that fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken and American so I can listen to that crunch alright would be good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces\nAnd I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender I says chicken it adds some of that is ... flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another ... OK okay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the best pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for a different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of money here and some lemon so I didn't do so you would yeah I don't I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken fried chicken and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting out this sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle and to kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I ...\nI like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the ... of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken fried chicken and went to write the hunting isn't the hunting has really brings out the sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle to kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end\nAnd was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having\nNot greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSoy sauce ginger little catch up sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it\nOh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried food so you fry it you cool it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy knows that's just for Christmas or is it yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy arenas\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger and\nCorn starch and then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important\nThis is double fried foods so you fry it you cool it down and they tried it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy

welcome\nYeah thank you for having me\nThose numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why [noise]\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but\nI I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars\nYou used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars um since then um rent\nFamilies I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars\nYou used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and\nReally it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNo you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up\nYou've seen a an issue where people are

daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happens before things start to crumble underneath them and it's a symptom\nOf the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes or no for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out in my community\nWe

I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter]\nBecause they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out and my community and I do drive ... to go to the address if they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expects me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment that they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers are experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis used in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with\nUm just

the country do you think it's the same root cause a each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with\nUm just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the neat so what kind of help or are you getting\nWe um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to have\nThe resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive\nWe'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to do it\nPrivate citizens it's our team at Bethel it's our hearts\nWe um send food packs home with every homeless students on friday so they have food for the weekend until they get back to

it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help the\nBig picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you will know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day in your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nUm their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it the bill ... them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be\nIs so low that it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be I'll just give you an example I had one
