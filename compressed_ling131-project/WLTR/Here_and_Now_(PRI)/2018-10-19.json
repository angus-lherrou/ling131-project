Eighteen into combat\nAnd she says she's really seen as a Democrats hope to kind of flip one Republican control district in the country in their favor\nYou know she prided herself on really trying to get out into rural parts of the district kind of the assumption is that a Democrat is going to do well in Lexington the urban center of this district but you know historically has not done so well out in rural areas and so she's really been trying to push her campaign out into the rural parts it's most evident last week she brought\nFor vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in ... ville it's a town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came to see the vice president\nBiden out to a rally in ... it's a town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came to see the vice president\nNow the thing about Amy McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars it about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and there's a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere's certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know a nascent nationwide interest in this race\nI mean at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand they're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more TV ads and it's really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November sick\nAnd what do the polls say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day\nEver there seems to be a new poll every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit there there's no way to really say that the one person has a an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge and and really if it's something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election\nDay so Kentucky ... six congressional district will be one of those key places people are watching to see if Democrats can take a seat from Republicans and flip the house in the Democrats' favor that's riling Barton statehouse reporter for Kentucky public radio thank you thanks Peter\nThat TV show the counters premiered this Tuesday on ABC it's a new version of the famous sitcom Roseanne but without Roseanne Barr\nABC revived Roseanne last spring the show was hit it was cancelled though after it started tweeted racist remarks now the rest of the cast is back together for a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it higher Rick\nHi so the first episode is a send off to the character Roseanne counter we learn that\nFor a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it higher Rick\nHi so the first episode is a send off to the character Roseanne counter we learned that she her character died of a an opioid overdose or here's a clip of her sister on the show Jackie who's played by Laurie Metcalf talking to John Goodman character Dan which is Roseanne husband\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nSo Roseanne Barr are released a statement after that episode aired calling the decision to kill off her character this way grin and morbid what do you think\n[noise] I think she's right but I also think the storytelling worked so [laughter]\nUm they had for shadow that I'm Roseanne Connor the character would be struggling with a an addiction and pain pills and so if they're going to kill off the character to do it in this way makes a lot of sense for the character and also hosted into all of these issues\nAbout people being under insured and the working class folk struggling to deal with medication all of this stuff that the show wants to talk about I can now talking about because of the way that there was any kind of character past well\nAll important issues the question is who saw the show a and we're seeing that the ratings for the premier of the Connors we're down to just ten point five million compared with Eighteen million people on average you tuned into Roseanne when they returned last march\nRight but um there's a few things going on there and I mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne revival was debuting and then you also had news that the rose encounter character was going to be a Trump supporter\nAnd publicity when Roseanne the revival was debuting\nAnd then you also had news that the rose encounter character was going to be a Trump supporter\nAnd I think that fueled a lot of talk about the show so I think it kind of made sense that it would do this huge number now over the course of his run it did an average of about Eighteen million viewers so I don't think the Connors is going to get to that level\nBut it's drawing about the same audience that rose in the revival was doing when it ended its run in may\nAnd then it's going to be their challenge the kind of building the audience and retain people who may have just watched the Connors out of curiosity to see what happened to Roseanne character\nBut they're avoiding more partisan politics and the ... than they did in Roseanne\nI seen two episodes of the show and for those two episodes it certainly seems that way you know originally if you remember the original version of Roseanne that was a show that tried to talk about all of the different issues that face to working class family and it wasn't quite as part is I mean\nI I have to say I I I watched that show a lot out when I was growing up and I never thought of it as a political show at all\nYeah I mean I think it actually was a political show it just wasn't about a particular political party so now the shows kind of back to what it was doing before which was\nWe're asking you to give back to the nonprofit radio service that helps you live your life the

last Wednesday one per ... per cent decline yesterday [noise]\nOf course that's nothing compared to what happened thirty one years ago today when the u._s. stock market dropped twenty two point six percent the largest single day loss in us history\nNew York times financial reporter Diana Henry case wrote about what led up to that day and what can be learned from it in her book a first class catastrophe the road to black Monday the worst day in Wall Street history I spoke with her last September and began by asking her what made her want to dive into this crisis\nWe're talking with younger people in my circle even younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew about the Nineteen eighty seven crash\nI Lived through it myself as a reporter but the mythology that has grown up around black Monday is really an amazing monument to Wall Street amnesia and let me tell you\nPeople will tell you oh it was no big deal was over in a day was one and done and nothing could be further from the truth so it was so\nI kind of wanted to solve a mystery here why has black Monday been so forgotten why have we not recognized what it was showing us and taken that to heart\nWell why did you start your book where you did in the seventies because he has to indicate that that was the beginning of what led to it\nGreat question and I'm Glad you raised a Jeremy my the book opens on the silver crisis I'm which was\nJoining of what led to a\nGreat question and I'm Glad you raised a Jeremy my the book opens on the silver crisis uh which was a bubble in the silver market\nBut what was significant about that crisis which was in the commodity market far from Wall street was the way it quickly led to the traditional fire breaks\nThe panic spread from market to market from the commodity market to the brokerage industry to banks and the various regulators of all those marketplaces barely knew each other's names\nSo we open on a world where official Washington is still kinda trapped in this delusion that there are all these isolated markets that can be regulated separately\nAnd the silver crisis in Nineteen eighty blew that delusion apart for those who are paying attention\nAnd then along the way I illustrate the heated occasions when\nA panic refused to stay where it was supposed to so that by the time you arrive at black Monday you understand that just didn't just pop out of the clear blue sky this was the culmination of a series of\nMisjudgments missteps fundamental changes in how Wall Street worked\nWhen one of the fundamental changes was the rise of electronic trading how how big a role to play\nIt was an enormous role and it was very unfamiliar to most investors at the time particularly the main street investors the extent to which computers were speeding the flow of orders into the marketplace at the speed of light\nAnd many of those markets were still operating at what I call the speed of life not the speed of light they were human markets they were trying to operate\nLight and many of those markets were still operating at what I call the speed of life not the speed of light they were human markets they were trying to operate as they had operated for a hundred years and they were overwhelmed by the pace of automated order delivery\nIn addition if further in the background in the shadows beyond even the vision of alert regulators were the use of computers to devise new and destabilizing trading strategies to create new\nFinancial derivatives that were used and imaginative and unusual ways so the computer was a tool of the financial engineers who are creating the new products that would show a effect trading on black Monday\nI must say as you're talking about this sounds kinda familiar ... after having just lived through the crash of two thousand hey you know people talking about a lot of ah fast trading and new products that nobody understands\nYou're exactly right I mean in in Nineteen eighty seven there were these tighten investors who use these untested derivatives\nIn computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system exactly the same thing happened in two thousand eight too big to fail investors using untested derivatives in\nHigh speed heard investing strategies with fragmented oversight so we're right back where we started only with exponentially larger scale and risks\nThat you brought up the issue of regulators you talk in this book about Ronald Reagan who took office or in Nineteen eighty one and was pushing for smaller government was appointing people who wanted to cut back on regulations how much responsibility\nDid Reagan and his administration have in the crash in Nineteen\nTo cut back on regulations how much responsibility did Reagan and his administration have in the crash in Nineteen eighty seven\nWell it's sort of a mixed bag Jeremy yes um there was a new deregulatory fever in Washington the way that played out however was in skimpy rations for the regulators so the to the extent that the regulatory machinery was\nUnder staffed and under financed that was a result of this determination to cut back on big government but I should point out that after the crash it was a blue ribbon commission appointed by President Reagan led by a staunch Republican ... Brady\nWho recommended that we scrap our current regulatory system and put a unit a fight regulator in charge\nIn Washington a so both you know the prescription for what we should do and some of the problems that gave rise to black Monday can be traced back to these political divisions but I should also say that\nThe Democrats in Congress on the left\nIn the Nineteen eighties we're not really part of the solution either a they won and more funding for regulatory agencies true but they failed to undertake the serious oversight of these profound changes in the marketplace\nOne I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators of the financial industry because it is so complicated how can we expect them to understand all these new products enough to oversee\nWell that's why we need to look at the regulatory structure we have we don't expect our politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately fund the department of energy and make sure that the risks\nOur politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately fund the department of energy and make sure that the risks that that agency overseas are adequately taken care of I think the same thing is true of our financial markets yes they are\nExtremely complex and yes they are algorithm driven and there's lots of rocket scientist from academia who were making fortunes on Wall street and that is arcane and bizarre for a lot of people in the political\nRealm but they still have the responsibility of making sure that the regulatory agency is appropriately structured appropriately funded and appropriately staffed so they can understand what's happening on Wall street even if they can't\nDo do you get a better understanding and writing this book of why crashes happen how something that seems small can get out of control very quickly and spread and cause a market crash\nYes\nAlthough it wasn't a big surprise you know we've been laboring for decades under the um\nThe notion of unofficial market irrational market where investors make rational decisions and and those decisions are incorporated into the prices of securities automatically I never found that particularly persuasive I've got two big an appreciation for how people panic in a crisis\nBut after researching a black Monday I don't understand how anyone can believe that that's an accurate explanation of how markets work\nWe're human beings we bring a lot of baggage to our investment decisions we get frightened we indulgent wishful thinking we ignore the red flags until it's too late that's the nature of the human mind", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "19"}
