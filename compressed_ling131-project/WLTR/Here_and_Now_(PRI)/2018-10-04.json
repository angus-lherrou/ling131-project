Senator Jeff flake said the investigation had produced no new corroborating information against Kavanaugh Republicans had from the national vote on the nomination tomorrow\nJoining us now NBC senior politics editor Beth food we Hi Beth hey Jeremy and what do you make of what we're hearing from Collins and Jeff Flake and what about Lisa Murkowski another undecided Republican\nWell our team caught up with Lisa Murkowski on the hell not long ago and she said she is reviewing the information she she really didn't give much indication of where her a vote would go but look with with senator Collins saying calling the investigation thorough a Senator Flake saying it produced no new crop writing information as you said\nThat's a sign that they essentially got what they needed a to vote yes for this nomination it's this FBI investigation however a brief and not conclusive as it probably was given how few ah we've learned that not that many people were interviewed and the whole thing just took place over the course of a few days\nIt was enough to give these undecided Republicans some cover and and and probably enabled them to vote yes\nWell and in fact Ford was not interviewed by the

and many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI and getting all the facts\n\nThis was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the

they they they're a Sater mansion from West Virginia has not yet indicated how he's got to vote\nHeidi Heitkamp probably the most endangered red state Democrats this year Senate or a member of the Senate from North Dakota\nHas not indicated so Democrats could lose some votes as well\nLook right now it's looking very very promising for the judge to be confirmed there's no indication that any of this has changed anybody's mind up there it's given Collins a and flakes certainly enough cover to vote yes and particularly if if Democrats stand to lose a voter too it's very hard to see how this

and was writing about a psychiatrist at the time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors that time and have a back story that involved the first World

very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease\nThat you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in

B. or he joins us now I ... I ... and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with past year so\nThe projection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective\nA spending usually does grow year over year but the average growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like\nRight so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year\nIs way fair the online furniture retail or they are

it the ... model or where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers\nQuite so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days that can increase minimum pay to Fifteen dollars an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season\nThe market research firm weak field of research published a survey last week of a thousand retailers and reported that the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars in forty cents that's a big jump from an average eleven and Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just above seven dollars an hour a nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on\nGifts could other Retail Federation says it's concerned about those terrorists has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... of the tariffs especially on Chinese imports could make their costs go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers\nOne more thing account big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on\nHere right so it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what
