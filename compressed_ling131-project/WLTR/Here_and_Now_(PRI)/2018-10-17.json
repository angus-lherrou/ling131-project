tidbit I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets napping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because your own Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing none of\nThem in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius\nIn that field it's just that uh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches\nDug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer I think it will be\nFabulous well so how does this all start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for

all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folk style\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had\nFeeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nRight and you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nRight that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out\nAnd I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because he was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah ... excellent biographies two of them and they both\nMentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crochet had pant it and that she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes [noise]\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called you and Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going to robin's worth as a ballet choreographer\nAnd

[noise]\nHow is this a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise] well I I just loved the stats and it's only about ten\nDancing around them and stuff but he's practically a solar whereas Robbins imagined this as a ...\nWonderful to ... I think we're it simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fun and his dream girl who\nComes and visit him and with those two dancers tend to kill the ... and ... was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves into practice mirrors\nThat is what it feels like and we are the mere they're looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in a mere as dancers sometimes do in a studio\nSaid that there's this weird feeling of we're spying on them in a way\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude toward things that had applied he was Balanchine loved dancers at a gathering which Robbins made and found chain said it was so great you should make more ... more like popcorn and he said like you could eat at the whole thing endlessly\nPopcorn and that's probably drove others you know off the cliff it looks a little dances at a gathering this is a the dance Robin faces Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise] he had been away from the New York city ballet doing Korea because\nHe's a Broadway but this cancer that a gathering was an instant hit [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day [noise]\nDancing the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage\nAnd sort of ended up with him [noise] touching the stage after many many minutes at

German away from age just stop delaying get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November it means they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law and former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now\nHigh Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner um but he can appoint agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee\nOr it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislative purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le descended could proceed on its own\nIf the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtained through the full house or the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of a committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this\nThis is a tax committee and so it certainly could be a legitimate reason to examine because uh the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been\nThat every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had\nA story about some of the tax filing prior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also\nFall there and there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud and that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to ... and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action what is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law and the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances\nOr the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress in the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch including the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials\nAre the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president didn't get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the present it and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nA there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon\nGovernment if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nA there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nAh the the the Coolidge administrators from that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year and there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses\nYou know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what do we really going to learn from them\nThat's a tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see\nYou know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax but it gives President Trump\nLet's make sure that you first dude filed returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut if President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character is simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be fairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the these decisions and is there some personal or business interest on the part of some of the decision making going on\nI Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they want her to know that all that would be something that might come out from an examination returns", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Columbia", "day": "17"}
