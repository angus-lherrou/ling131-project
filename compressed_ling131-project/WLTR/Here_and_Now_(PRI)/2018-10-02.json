Larry Summers walking back to her now\nGlad to be with Germany and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it\nNever seen so much ado about so little I thought the old trade regime between Canada and Mexico in the United states was a good one and this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth\n... alienation of major allies I Can't imagine these are ... relatively small changes the vast majority of NAFTA is continuing as it was\nThis has been a major diversion from the important domestic challenges facing the United

important international challenges but I'm happy with the new agreement puts simply because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what I say any changes\nAre tiny compared to the overall

constrained this has been the most short sighted of strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used\nTo go after them have been quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government they encourage the Chinese on a road\nTo self sufficiency and independence from the United states\nWhich ultimately will reduce our leverage influence\nThey fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community which is surely the most effective way to influence Chinese behavior I think that any\nConscientious American administration would be addressing issues about\nChinese trade practices and in particular the ones who are relating to intellectual property but I don't think the strategy she wore the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long\nRun American interests and what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are\nIf you I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about\nChinese trade practices and in particular ones relating to intellectual property but I don't think the strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China\nThey're all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want tariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs that companies need in order to compete that's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient\nAnd so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting\nFocusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the taxes on uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas\nSo are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being taxed cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican\nThis in front of President Trump is clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist buddy it's quite clear that\nOn uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas\nSo

Republican\nThis in front of\nPresident Trump is\nClear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist\nBuddy it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge sponsored\nAnd supported by President Trump and President Trump may not have a majority within America with him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline and therefore he is able to a\nRally Republican

inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to

the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know the honest to\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so\nTo hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as what was so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\nSo uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from uh from now my friends but ah at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on\nDollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that is what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really like my job and for me it's not about work for me it was about a free myself from this idea of mandatory labor\nYou know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what you and your wife did just to keep the story going his way it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage\nYou moves you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement habit\nMandatory labor many of us just say you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what'd you and your wife did just to keep the story going is it's a major part of this fire move and it's called arbitrage you move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now\nBut I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replaced your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant trees that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels uh this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest breeze to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance but the\nYeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough\nThat the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game and have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race is\nOne of the the main draw for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't

enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know and then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race\nOne of the the main draw for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial advisor you're essentially betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big dips in dives\nAnd if you can ride those waves if you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a nice entry point for me well\nIn part of this in order to do this as a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you were absolutely miserable and we'd go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable with some of the things you were doing\nYeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that our quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for a year we we actually we went and spent some time living with\nMade the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping

we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for a year we we actually we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter\nAnd we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents' house maybe it was a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we were living in the air and space and\nBy the way people have pointed out this isn't something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work in an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it's just so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire we'd like one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems a lot of money but you're potentially going to live Seventy more years [noise] I mean have you ever thought about that\nAnd then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it's just so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire we'd like one million one point two million one point five million invested
