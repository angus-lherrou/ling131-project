crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental

retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats governor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors

November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her island and I can tell you in person um explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get to hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into this\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming guts\nMeant so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in

I don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them and we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative\nI don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them and we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract isn't the way over here and then these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner\nAnd that's climbing so at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and so many young people the college just the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through a future builders America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school\nAnd they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field of making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but but not to lead immigration just yet\nIf you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and it's you're telling me it's necessary for your industry so what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard workers often times the immigrants are ... on the job before anybody else they're working hard they're staying till sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need\nMy I I you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's a lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and\nOne thing I notice in common of all of them is it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because\nTheir homes or go on their place of business might be gone to shop the ad is gone it's going to take\nA lot of builders from a large part of the country that's just the way it is what else would change this equation we see a movie recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools\nWe spent many years not exposing young people to that\nType work and telling them what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college the guys right here standing here doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nDoes she think there'd be some sort of government involvement in kind of making it more enticing how else to get their\nRevert back to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisor heroes and you're\nYou know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners and companies double triple that one more thing I think stigma that's what the big talk was the last Thirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work\nThat's what the big talk was the last Thirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big hardly you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it may be so uncertain because of the warming the and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will know how to deliver\nNo I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe other states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City and in Mexico beach the structures that survived\nWe're not that much different than what we're building right here in Tallahassee they're just good quality oh let's\nGo back to your question no if it's global warming and I'm not sure what you're referring to with our state and what do I say if their fees warming and and you know this has been going on this weekend we went down to care about it", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city":
