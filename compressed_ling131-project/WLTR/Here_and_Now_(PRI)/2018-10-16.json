so\nIt was really traumatic experience I took a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult futures that on that day I decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to

important to continue and to keep these stories of life\nAnd he said something so compelling they're usually when that journalists get killed there on to something and so for you it's about\nFiguring
