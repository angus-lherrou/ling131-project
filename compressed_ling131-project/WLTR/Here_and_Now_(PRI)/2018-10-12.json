say treats at your and being game is on point how will look out for him I wanted to add\nTo that was my mom he's using his fame wisely is for them to pay ... frankly hideous\nOkay hosted a shame on al Jazeera English I'm sure there will be a conversation if any thank you You're welcome it's here now and\nDuring a surprise inspection of California's Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new suits made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart ... report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs it for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for their immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story former welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new she's made a bed sheets in Fifteen\nCells how is that possible oh well that's\nA good question you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert saying these sort of were issues that needed to be addressed immediately because [noise]\nThe office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of where issues that needed to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago a man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the\nInspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from vents in so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nShould we live in that that many people inside the facility worse suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those yeah I I don't think\nSo um you know people are told the inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would on for all the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughed at them off and then call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempts weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside that building by any means what else did you find\n[noise] right so the other things that the office of the inspector general uh highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was you know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a\nQuestion of untimely inadequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and\nAn adequate medical care um and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and you know the thing about immigration detention is it's supposed to be\nWhat they call civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to\nHappen and so when you're using disciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned but doctors stamp their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to foster teeth [noise]\nUm and I said what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving immigration detention\nIs governed by ah what are called his performance space national detention standards and not governs everything about medical care that detainees are supposed to receive and obviously this care is supposed to be\nTimely you know it's supposed to be adequate for these detainees who are have no choice but to rely on the care that they're given inside these facilities\nThe exhibition

and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nShot and you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the constantly more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia\nThe BBC's mark low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nYeah that'd be a source close to touch investigation said turkey has gone documents that evidence to support the claim off state sponsored mud ... when he entered the Saudi ... ten days ago\nAnd this socialist that tells us that I'm On course official position is still that ... is missing about that at ... knows for sure that he was mud and not backs up the American news reports and all that audio and video a video evidence\nThe recordings shoving them sticker shock she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that and they're very gruesome details coming out including recordings allegedly of him being beaten I'm I'm some reports are that his body was just men but I'm the Saudi or officials Saudi authorities are still slapped me to knowing all the allegations\nHow reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence\nUm I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this is not strange communication strategy with it\nI Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this is not strange communication strategy with his government hearing techie where they don't really speak directly to foreign media for example they and they don't\nActually have a ... communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the movement teachers that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach is that for example tacky is welcomed in Saudi officials here\nTo be calling so they joined Saudi Turkish investigation or that the Saudis have proposed\nThat is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't want to put all our diplomatic relationship at this stage but they all lead king\nI'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and therefore tightening the screws on the Saudis and try and get the ... western backing for the ... position the question about that joint committee the Saudi Turkish investigation has to be how credible\nIt can be if it includes the Saudi Government\nYeah and I think that it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint signed the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I I really think that they say is kind of\nUm a diplomatic nice city on the parts of of the tax entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have called the evidence to back up their espresso allegation\nAnd there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists are people noting that at all\nThe biggest jailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by Chuck E. ... such as a spot and you know that said at techies not treating journalist and the same way as a journalist is alleged are being treated like that it's not my murdering hey we're talking about\nUh how tech is locked up journalist which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them in completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on a liberal\nDuring hey we're talking about uh how tech is locked up journalist which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on liberal values but but uh yeah there is some distance do between the two cases I think here\nIn our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and his stumble how much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the racial Saudi Arabia is important\nIt doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage but uh I think that you know clearly tucked he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is ineffective flagrant violation of its sovereignty aid it won't support from the U.S and from other western governments in and taking a tough line towards\nThe towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson held in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government uh what are we learning about that\n[noise] yeah this is a country that produces more news and it can can see him ready and American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in a massive Punjab the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not interfere with the independence of the tech is traditionally which is seen as laughable abide by critics of techie and what's happened today is that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which\nBasically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody so Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was a source of must've friction between the U.S in an ... governments at sanction\nFinally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was the source of must've friction between the U.S and and ... governments at sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack US Currency ah that as well and I expected to east to some extent\nAnd it will be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's more glowing in Istanbul thank you so much pressure\nNot back to the U.
