PCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jerry and when you're listening there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but they're well dressed but they're homeless\nYeah to me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know I'm demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on how it's for a long time ...\nNo I'm demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse and a lot of the things that people complain\nAbout street homelessness you know the associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nWe're getting an example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county next to city hall in Santa Ana so you know people saw this every day when they walked past it I Can't ... has been it's been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis leading in parks are asking for money on sidewalks and is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does who salaries can't keep up with those market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nThis free community exhibits on display in the springs house galleries through October sponsored by the ... family el Sisi a and a Lancaster county art and fellowship Borgia made through a highly competitive anonymous process are based solely on artistic excellent\nThe south Carolina arts commission will award up to for individual\nArtist fellowship five thousand dollars for twenty Nineteen twenty twenty\nTo encourage the pursuit of artistic excellence and provide financial support to South Carolina artist ... working in visual arts\nMusic composition and music performed\nThe orange bring recognition that may open doors to other resources and employment opportunities\nThe deadline to apply is November and\nYou're listening to South Carolina public radio\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.
