to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friends said when he heard that that was what threw him back over half a century ago he was seven I'd gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to cast treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried if that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline reported busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago\nCall goes rape crisis hotline calls tripled and ... heads the clinical program at the why do you see a of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all through the seas rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from the week prior\nAnd five times as many calls as two weeks ago ... say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call you right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years\nAfter listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that the testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flashback you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter ...\nSara Lee tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pin down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this is it about sex did do people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIs the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically one of three ways we're going to fight\nWe're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and what part of the Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing that as well from the survivors if we'd work with\nWe usually people have a flashback she's also explain dust that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor replied and sing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talked to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience wives and so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part related to their wrist\nPart of that experience wives and so it might be the worst part related to the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain to literally ... presents themselves and re experience that trauma\nAnd incredibly intense way well\nSome of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I don't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to a what that was exactly like for harmful yes yes yeah\nLook the majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by him music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know ...\nYou know it was happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump

being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause of Dr Ford said and as I saw many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors and it's a part of trauma and so to expect a
