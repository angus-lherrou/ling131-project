O. two captured 'em there's another company in Canada it puts it closer to two hundred and fifty per metric time but it's catch expensive\nThat's expensive and just to put that\nCompany in Canada and protect crushing two hundred and fifty per metric kind that it's catching friendship\nExpensive and just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to over the whole world now I think the number of about five dollars is about right there is other places it's high like in Sweden and then you got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about the technology is is the costs have come down so as you say climb works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of Syria to\nTheir next plan plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of CEO to\nThere's another company called carbon engineering and Kennedy has things that can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there's a U.S company called the global thermostat\nThat uh is doing it the first demonstration in Alabama this year and they think that'll be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get it down to a hundred after that so this idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it\nIt seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built\nWithout severe problems and with costs it seemed to be starting to come down so there's the potential to really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have the lemon juice impacts one of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of C. O. two by mid century\nUm and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned that's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I I think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies but that really doesn't fit with\nIn terms of commercial director or capture and I\nI think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies but that really doesn't fit with the scale the challenger facing so that's that's the real challenge for director captures how you scale up from three companies doing on the order of five or six plants to\nSomething like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten years\nSix hundred thousand well are you getting the investors excited about that\n[laughter] you know that that may be the future but look again Steven Pinker writes set the more speculative end of this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse pulverized rock that takes up CEO to as weather's too at alkaline clouds of the oceans to dissolve more C. O. two in the water\nFertilize the ocean with iron to accelerate photosynthesis by plankton and against ... two out of the atmosphere and in different ways what do you say though\nTo how her talk I'm a fellow of seeing things at MIT who says in effect that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing a sea of two emissions if people start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes\nCalled uh the journey term for it as moral hazard this idea that\nIf you have this technology available it's kind of like an insurance policy and then you'll engage in risky behavior and in this case means you won't produce some missions uh enough\nI I actually think we're not we don't really have the the luxury of dismissing this negative emotions technology is something that I'm able to take away our incentives I mean it's kind of like you know an insurance policy for health insurance or fire insurance or something like that where", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "15"}
