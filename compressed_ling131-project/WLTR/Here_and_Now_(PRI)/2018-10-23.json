staples\nYear and now the ride hailing company lift is bringing electric scooters to Washington DC it's the first east coast city to get scooters from left but scooters are already widespread in the nation's capital with companies like bird lime and skip already offering rental ... electric scooters for short trips around the city\nJak Meridian is the director of the Washington DC department of transportation he joins us now Jeff\nHi Jeremy so how many scooters are there in DC right now approximately well we currently have upwards of two thousand ... vehicles both a bike and scooters combined and how long it's\nSimply well we currently have upwards of two thousand doc was vehicles both a bike and scooters combined and how long have they been around\nWe launched a pilot program about a year ago or to allow these companies to demonstrate the technology here in Washington DC about a year ago and have people been happy with them so far are what are they saying\nWell we've gotten a lot of feedback about their use and certainly there are several people who have a really be begun to use these as a part of their daily commuting experience and others who are using them or for periodic trips\nTo go a long distance or how far are they going to commute the scooter\nWhat we've seen a different types of trips in some cases they are short distances in some cases they are a longer connection a distance is getting to and from metro stations for example so there are a number of use cases that we have observed or over the past year\nAnd one of the things that a lot of cities have said about these scooters one of the problems that they've seen is that people just leave them on the sidewalks and the clog up the sidewalks and then if you're disabled and you're trying to use your wheelchair and get down the sidewalk you could get stuck because there's there are a bunch of scooters in front of using that they're\n[noise] this is something that we heard very early on during the demonstration period and it's something that we took very seriously in working with\nThe companies to ensure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use a were reflective of those things and that has become something that we're we're working very closely to to enforce and and we see the incidents of those things are decreasing and\nDo you have a good relationship with the companies are you in contact with them regularly\nWe have ah been working with them to collect data and information and also to report problems that we hear from from members of the public here in Washington DC uh and so we have uh\nInformation or and also to report problems that we hear from from members of the public here in Washington DC uh and so we have a opened a line of communication with them to ensure that we're sharing information at and that they're sharing information with us\nAnd they are sharing information with you that's correct\nSo obviously one of the big concerns is safety and I'm just last month there was an SUV that hit and killed a man who is writing a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time that somebody has\nDied in an accident in the U.S on on one of these scooters what do you know about that or what can you tell us about that and and how you're making sure that that doesn't happen again it leads to the extent that you can try to stop it from happening again\nShore well D.C is a city that is committed to vision zero which is a a a strategy that under the leadership of our mayor we've put in place or to eliminate roadway fatalities in serious injuries and we're doing everything that we can taking it very seriously to work with\nUh the technology companies that are here to ensure that that their rules and regulations are are are followed by their users we're also taking a number of steps to ensure that we're building the safest possible infrastructure [noise]\nAh it's worth noting that all forms of transportation come with inherent risks and so we're working with in this case with these companies specifically a two to ensure that they are promoting the safest possible a use for their users and that we are\nA informing the public about uh about this new form of technology this new form of mobility that is on the road\nWith one of the things that people have said about the the safety risk of these scooters is that a lot of the people who ride them not just in Washington but all over the country are wearing helmets and that they're they're out on the roads with cars but they're not wearing helmets or do they have to wear helmets in D.C currently\nThe law and DC are for helmets is is limited to individuals\nWe're going to home is uh do they have to wear helmets in D.C\nCurrently the law and DC are for helmets is is limited to individuals who are sixteen or under or some of the companies as you may know do a giveaway helmets and they strongly incentivize or riders to use helmets or and and that's something that that I think companies are are thinking about as a as this technology moves forward\nAnd what about a a government or what about the district of Columbia are are you thinking or are people in D.C thinking about putting in a law that says that people have to wear helmets if they're writing these rented scooters [noise]\nYou know I Can't speak to what lawmakers may or may not do with respect to changing the the current helmet law certainly we are always encouraging both cyclists and people who are using scooters or to to be as safe as possible and that that includes wearing helmets\nSo you get to see the data as you said what are you finding about how this is changing transportation in DC is it having a big effect [noise] it's it's very\nEarly to tell what what the impacts will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling into to trip taken that's really why we have decided to do this\nIn an incremental approach to allow uh kept a number of these vehicles on the street to observe their use patterns but also to to really a dive deep into the data to to get a better understanding of of how the public is interacting with them\nAnd right now the cap number is what the cat number is four hundred per company okay and so now we're talking about with the addition of lift are currently in a district there there are five companies five companies\nDo you have you been in Washington now for a number of years how big is the addition of electric scooters doc less rent a bull electric scooters compared to any other changes that you've seen in transportation including by the way over and left over the years I Am\nYou mentioned uber and Lyft because they're\nScooters compared to any other changes that you've seen in transportation including by the way over and left over the years\nI Am glad that you mentioned uber and Lyft because there was a time when that technology first emerged and came into the market uh that that people were asking a lot of the same types of questions that we are now asking about a duck was bikes and scooters\nThis is a significant change it's one that provides a new mobility opportunity and\nUnder the leadership of our mayor Muriel Bowser it's something that we have a embrace but have done so in a very incremental way to ensure that are that the technology is utilized a in a safe way for the residents and visitors of the district of Columbia\nThere are still a lot of cities in this country that do not allow the scooters and I'm In one of them right now what would your advice be to other cities that are considering whether to allow doc less a electric rentals scooters on the roads\nMy advice is really to to listen to the public we very deliberately opened up a comment period where we got lots of feedback and lots of information from the public uh from really all across the spectrum and that's something that we take very seriously we analyze it and we use it to inform the policymaking going forward\nThat jeopardy and who is director of the Washington DC department of transportation Jeff thank you thank you

this year and now when you think of the titans of technology who comes to mind Steve Jobs Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg how about Patrick McGovern\nHe founded a company called international data corporation back in Nineteen sixty four it produced magazines like computer world Mac world and PC World and similar publications around the world\nBut government who died in twenty fourteen became a billionaire as the company grew and author Glenn risk and has just written a book about him called future forward Glenn risking welcome to hear now\nThanks Jeremy it's great to be here so Patrick McGovern not a household name but very important guy who was he\nHe was the entrepreneur and visionary who started a company called international data group I D G and what he saw was that the information technology revolution was getting started in the early sixties it was slow and\nSteady but he saw something bigger happening and over those years he decided that somebody needed to tell the story of this revolution there was one thing to be\nThe bill gates or the Thomas Watson junior who made things the software and hardware but somebody needed to chronicle what was going on and that was his mission\nSo he created computer world magazine computer world and Mac world as well\nHe created actually nearly three hundred publications around the world over the course of fifty years running the company but yes the first publication was computer world\nWhich became the Bible of the information technology industry what was in it what what would you find in computer well it was it was news weekly news it was product reviews and things like that but mostly\nAllergy industry what was in it what what would you find in computer well it was it was news weekly news it was product reviews and things like that but mostly it was\nTaking a look at the people and players in the industry the companies that were moving and shaking um they were big uncovering IBM in the late sixties and to the seventies when they were the eight hundred pound gorilla in the in the industry space [noise] um and as it moved along as the industry changed the personal computer was created in the Nineteen eighties\nComputer world would would be the newspaper of record so to speak it was kind of the New York times of the computer industry was also thinking about it in comparison to Bloomberg uh which you know people on Wall street they've all got these Bloomberg terminals which they pay a lot of money for just to get information so they have the latest information is that the same kind of thing who is he talking to with\nComputer world than Mac world well\nIf you're older Mac world would be slightly different audiences Mac world was really aimed right away at the apple marketing backing it started on the day they release the Macintosh computer and I ... for investors or who this would have been the computer world was aimed early on at data processing managers deep team managers who morphed into\nWhat we now think of is ... chief information officer as\nIt wouldn't ... there were no terminals\nI'm set up like Bloomberg this was strictly a newspaper\nToday obviously it's strictly on line but you know over the course of those three or four decades computer world was a print publication and it was aimed at at offering technology people an insight into what the products were who is using them how they were using them\nAnd they made the big leap which was an important leap in showing that these guys were not just techies hidden behind glass walls these people were going to contribute big time to the business because technology was going to drive things and you worked there a computer I did I joined in Nineteen eighty three at the time didn't know a computer\nTime to the business because technology was going to drive things and you worked there a computer I did I joined in Nineteen eighty three at the time didn't know a computer from a washing

just loving it because something really exciting what's happening I started interviewing Bill Gates and Steve Jobs before the New York times and Wall Street journal did\nSo I was you know right there as I say in the book at the tip of my keyboard things were happening and I stayed there for seven years at which time during which time I got to know pat McGovern [noise] so what was it about him that was so special\nWell there's lots of visionaries lots of entrepreneurs out there who've done great things but had had a very unique style of management and leadership\nWhich is what the book is about that he saw the world differently he didn't need to be in the spotlight what he wanted was to fulfill a mission\nAnd one of the keys to him to feel fulfilled his mission was to treat his employees around the world in a way that most companies did\nAnd this was a guy or for example\nAt the holidays he would go around to every office in the United states we're talking about five thousand people at the time he would go to every desk\nHe would meet and greet every employee he knew if you would work there before and he'd seen you the year before he not only remember your name he knew your wife's name he knew how many kids had [noise]\nHe would congratulate you on some project that you did and he would thank you for the contributions you were making to the company and then he would hand you a holiday card which was stuffed with cash holiday bones and\nPeople were blown away by this I was blown away by this when it happened I heard that it was happening but when you don't believe it until you actually shows up at your desk in this\nPeople were blown away by this I was blown away by this when it happened I heard that it was happening but when you don't believe it until you actually shows up at your desk and this need this desire to to make a connection to every employee\nI mean I Can't think of another CEO who did that one it's great in terms of fostering a a really nice atmosphere for the worker but he was also able to make a lot of money and and you point out you go through a number of business lessons\nFrom pat in the governor and and one of them is that he would allow ideas to develop he would you say he would give people what three quarters of losses until he finally put a stop to things but basically he'd give people a long time or to try things out to experiment\nOne of ... one of the actual corporate values the ten corporate values of the company is let's try it\nAnd his idea was that great ideas we're gonna emanates from everywhere and anywhere inside the company um if somebody was smart enough to come up with the idea could make a case for the idea he said let's try it and he would give you some funding and he would let you go with it\nUm and it created numerous publications that created numerous opportunities um one of the great stories that came from that attitude was the for dummies books\nWhich are now those are from him those were originally from like ... for dummies absolutely there was a they started a book division and they had this gentleman named John Kilcullen who come into the division wasn't doing well at all he remembered a story about a friend who was at a computer store back in the eighties and\nAsked the clerk listen I Need a book about this MS dusting you know but I don't know anything that's got to be something like ... for dummies\nAnd kill ... remembered that title suggested to govern let's do a series of books about this\nAnd McGovern thought well we're insulting our readers if we're calling them dummies and kill called and said no we're doing is this is ...\nThe books about this and McGovern thought well we're insulting our readers if we're calling them dummies and kill called and said no what we're doing is this is pre YouTube pre Internet we can give them\nReally reasonable instructions on how to be smart about technology because technology is complicated so they went with that and the for dummies books became this remarkable global brands is I mean literally two or three thousand titles in print\nThe other thing that that it was interesting uh as I was reading your book is that he early on this is decades ago\nReally took an interest in China he would go over there you would have meetings with people that you would eat all kinds of crazy things when he would do business deals are that that that would impress his a Chinese colleagues because he was willing to try things like that\nWell like I said pat was a visionary in one of the places that his vision took took place was in China\nHe showed up there in Nineteen Seventy eight he actually got off a plane where he wasn't legally allowed to ... there were no diplomatic relations with China at the time he somehow talk this way into the city of Beijing which was called the king then\nAnd he wandered around the streets he had one day to do this and can only imagine this six foot three inch mass of American in a dark business suit wandering around the streets of Beijing\nLooking in bookstores looking at what people were doing and realizing that there was number one massive population and number two they were starved for information and there was going to be an opportunity here that he was going to get into well before anyone in two years later he went back\nMade a deal with one of the ministries and he was publishing China computer world by October of Nineteen eighty [noise]\nSo how would he want to be remembered right now you've written this book about him ... what do you think he would want people
