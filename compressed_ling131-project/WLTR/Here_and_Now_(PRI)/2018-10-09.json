[noise]\n[noise]\nThe last\nTwo years\n\nMoon and all of\n\nYou is the poorest as opposed to do is a string players who are blowing their instruments the ... how does your preparation look different and how do you work with his very established traditional group of four strings players and get them to branch out into the guitar quintet\nMy perspective it's a little bit like um you know their guitars essentially a percussion instrument it belongs to the percussion family the same way that the ... and the piano do so there's a string that's either hammered are blocked and the sound of caves right away right so we're string players can sustain with the boat\nSo those two different sounds coming together create an interesting bland so it's probably not on like you know when a string quartet plays with a piano and of course there's tons of repertoire for the nineteenth century for that combination\nBut the difference being that whereas the piano can sometimes over power the string quartet sometimes the the string quartet if not careful could overpower the guitar\nSo for them to the challenge is is becoming sensitive to the guitar and what is the actual dynamic range is and then I kind of push the sound a little bit more in the upper kind of you know forte are louder\nArranges for the book or any we've never needed an amplification you know like I I'll carry a small apple firing a microphone with me on some of these things for playing or something by air and Jay current events\nGood an amplification you know like I I'll carry a small apple firing a microphone with me on some of these things for playing or something by air and Jay current us or say the castle knowable Tabasco Clinton\nBut the case the ... the texture is light enough that the players can still play with their child and the guitar doesn't really get covered too much so\nWe tend to play this piece particular piece of these concerts with nothing really just a on amplified but I mean we've been playing together for so long that we just sort of fall right into it when we see each other again and also we're we're all friends and we love hanging out together and and that kinda thing so it makes it really fun I always look forward to seeing those guys\nI've always thought that chamber music there's a certain inter personal element beyond just being able to collaborate music lead it has to be there for it to really be pulled off\nCorrect yeah that's why that's why I enjoy chamber music so much and\nAnd even doing you know chamber music festivals in the summertime where you're meeting new people and you you were hers for a day and then you play the next day for the audience and that's a very exciting thing for the audience and those audiences come from that experience because they know that that a lot of these musicians are meeting for the first time\nAnd a game together working hard and then performing the piece of the next day that there's an excitement of the freshness that comes from that\nThat the audience is of those particular thing you'd find very exciting but for the performers it's very social type of thing as well which is you know very different feeling from you know sitting in your hotel room and preparing a a solo piece of crafting it you know to a to a diamond like a\n... you know you can't really do that with chamber music and that's what I teach with my students the Cleveland Institute of music and also Curtis Institute of music in Philadelphia is that this is a very different animal from\nPlaying solo music you you know you have to have your antenna out and and play reactive way to those around you it's much different type of thing\nIt's a very different animal from\nSolo music you you know you have to add your antenna out and and play reactive way to those around you it's a bunch of different type of thing\nSo with this emphasis on chamber music do you have any projects in the work I Know your album play was obviously a solo recording with you on the grounds right but are you working on another recording with the actual quartet or any\nOther yeah we have actually we have our record in the can already it's actually the final stages of its post production um I don't have a firmer leaf stayed on it right now from the record label is eco records which has to believe I recorded for for\nAlmost Twenty years now I'm very excited about that we've all listen through to a couple of different aspects of the recording and yeah it's pretty much ready to go and I have this particular book or any\n... on it and also a wonderful concept I kept falling over ... and also won by American composer Aaron Jean Curtis that piece is called\nOne hundred greatest dance at influenced by disco but like hip hop it was written in the early nineties and kind of chronicles energy crisis experiences riding the subway train you know to and from work\nWow so it is it a medley of sorts or\nIt's not a medley of their all original tunes by current as written kind of in this written in a style that is not meant to copy of the styles of discovered meant to sort of a vote that the feeling of it\nI'll be I'll be looking in listening out for a that release\nYou're also big time educator I mean you help cut down the guitar department and Curtis Institute and also in the Cleveland Institute in music now for over Twenty years and never has goals probably give you a lot of perspective as an educator so what's the future of classical guitar looking like\nWell it's looking pretty bright because the young players that the ...\nAs an educator so what's the future of classical guitar looking like\nWell it's looking pretty bright because the young players at the highest level are playing\nReally really well technically technically on the instrument they're just playing really amazing and there's more tons of competitions around the world that offer them you know chances to compete\nWell what we do need a little bit on the other end of the little board chair music education for them\nSo when we when we send them out into the world are able to function and take gigs and become good readers and I think most of the time that's really what we see that they're not really prepared\nTo fight read something or learning things on the fly and in today's world that's a pretty important go for a good harvest have but I definitely think are our future is bright there's so much out there\nAnd the the core of talented classical would hire us and the education level is much higher and the core of the core of players as much wider so\nIn that sense I mean really like you know I don't live at this point\nAnd finally you've been described as among the elite of states classical guitarist as well as the most precise in Seoul classical guitarist of your generation usually when I hear ... because of an absence of the other ones I think that's pretty unique a and on top of that you won a Grammy as we mentioned\nSo given all this what advice would you have for an aspiring guitarist an upcoming musician who wants to accomplish similar things\nOh well I mean you know just being all being open to as many musical experiences as as one thinks they can handle I mean it's a lot of it is sort of a ... having a sense of time management and just kind of knowing knowing one's limitation as well and that it's not a race it's a it's a marathon [laughter]\nWell Jason thanks so much for the perspective\nKind of knowing knowing one limitation well and that it's not a race it's a it's a barrel\nWell Jason thanks so much for the

Justin Paul hello there even though it's in L. O.\nThen I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIs not directly based on something had happened to my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were a myself included\nAnd I was struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like a our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling themselves about how he's going to have a good day\nAnd what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself\nThey're also a troubled classmates but he presented kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansen kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control\nAnd also kind of changes him Stevenson this idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just gotta keep going with this story because everything you've always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well I um she feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who course isn't I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things\nHow you were able to put those feelings into a song what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nNo it's true um explain that we talked a lot about at the beginning of the process with Val which was you know how do you take the would become sort of temple moments when the musical how do you take that in translated into a book it is an interesting process of how do you get\nYou know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments in the musical how do you take that in translated into a book it is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as as a novel because\nThe book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters in especially Evan Hansen really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before there I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide USDA I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nSure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other\nSuicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and the and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's there's a him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all\nYou know I'm darkness they don't want to get anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor ... do you really want to know more about counter do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does an Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know isn't the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nAlso feels like a cautionary tale for kind of what it's like this\nDoes what he does you know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media ... and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ... I understand that while you debated what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan Connor what might happen\nYeah this is just and you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing the novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fans around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listen to the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and\nFellowship Borgia made through a highly competitive anonymous process are

patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits Cuban confidences but continue to this day\n... professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we would you go that people take care of their teams take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a civilian section on a fragment refugees so the the temptation to go beyond\nSo she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nSays you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work\nIs something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues had noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shore is if Greece a pretty high margin is quite community\nHow could that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the

working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHad grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah follows me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor everyone\nThe genocidal exchange with populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah ... they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece these ... workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have no need for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to the origins of you know my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nAnd to be able to go back and offer what I can we were just there in September [noise] talking to folks in so long ago and asked them about the work that we do\nAnd a recording help from the Greek psychiatric community
