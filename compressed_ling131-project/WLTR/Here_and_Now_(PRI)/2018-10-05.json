sitcom went off the air CBS has revived it for an eleventh season Candice Bergen plays the older but still fast talking broadcast journalist who returns alongside the original cast NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it ...\nHey so Murphy Brown was always about mining politics for entertainment back in the day I'd had fans from both sides of the aisle Senator Orrin hatch Republican of Utah even sending the head shot hoping to make a guest appearances [laughter] do you think you could have crossover appeal today or are they even making an effort now\nAnd when and where are you know I spoke to the show's creator and show runner Diane English in LA in July and basically she told me she didn't think they would be a show 'em there would be a revival or if\nIn LA in July and basically she told me she didn't think they would be a show 'em there would be a revival uh if if Trump hadn't been elected president\nUm she was a how supportive of Hillary Clinton ran a pack um that was connected to her before the election had a huge party at our house ah\nAh for the election and had like two hundred bottles of champagne that she could no open when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how they affect the Trump has had on politics on media especially ah she's got this show that features these people were supposed to be taught journalist\nSo of course pushing back against that has become one of the major themes in the revival of of Murphy Brown\nAnd because he's so close to Hillary Clinton of course she uh she got the former secretary of state or to actually make an appearance on this show so we've got a clip of that uh let's let's let's say\nAnd I also see you've had previous secretary always theory absolutely for four years I was the secretary I like the secretary of a very large right [noise]\nHave the skills computer nail emails [noise] I I Do have some experience with [noise]\nAlways makes you wonder if there's nothing again I get out [laughter] no I doubt it I don't think they would have brought up emails editor re\nIt ... you know Hillary Clinton has been having some fun she was she's also appeared in a an episode of a Madam Secretary that trauma um alongside and Colin Powell and I'm I'm a ... and uh other political so I'm ... this show has been very much about pushing back against Trump isn't the Murphy Brown revival\nAnd I'm In an in an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back\nI'm In an in an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back against some of the things they do so this shows very much about pushing back against Trump ism and pushing back against the monitor shape but the GOP so it it is not a bipartisan\nThat the original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real life needs fiction moment during the Nineteen Ninety two presidential election Quayle made of family values speech where he criticized the character Murphy Brown for having a child outside of marriage then the character Murphy round responded to quilt criticisms in the show\nAnd now it seems like the show is trying to manufacture that same dynamic with President Trump\nYeah there there's a a there was a scene towards the end of the first episode of the revival where Trump was supposedly watching these fictional um news characters on the air and tweeting about them and then they were reading the tweets in them responding to him I think we have [noise]\nYou know [noise]\nSo of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a delivered a very F F effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show I think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival I I didn't I found\nSome of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned and and some of the speech fined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a ...\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like it kind of wish the show I'm ... these people make any kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweeted them a while I was going on\nShow 'em ... these people making a kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it and sort of treated them a while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but\nUm what's really happening is that there are so many people that have been saying things like this for so long on TV including most of the late night uh comedians that we have you know Stephen ... Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh Trevor Noah that it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nA it felt different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think his left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times\nWell what about the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bring back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots\nI'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne uh came back\nWhatever you think of stories and Boris politics\nUm there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that\nAre fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows\nThat are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver and all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run in the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slapped living near the show a over it so I'm a you know those\nProcedural adventure stories and in a slap living near the show a over it so I'm a you know those have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon at will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne were I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show hadn't been in syndication for a long time so ah you know I don't think a lot of younger people we're all familiar with the show and because the the the revised version of it\nI'm Still a little awkward and kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding\nNew fans severe TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAnd again to our top story today the Senate advancing Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lobbed at Kavanaugh has prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct\nMost have changed significantly since back then but as NPR's Tovia Smith reports some say there's still a ways to go\nTo many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recall hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it\nInside the door and my friend recall hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was\nIn Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh when centered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster\nGeorgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents see bad to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women\nJohn Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nThis has been called to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't some gauge to him soul searching was making a mistake schools have already\nChanged dramatically since the eighties Paul for he says driven by evolving attitudes and society at large stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent\nNeck and each has been represented by many top galleries or Manhattan renowned architect David ... second inches work\nAwhile ... between free wheeling bohemian abandoned and settled down to ...

now the unemployment rate fell to three point seven percent in September the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan and senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now from Mike Hi Germany will start with a number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well right as you\nMentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um ... you know a lot of companies that might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people are away from work to do the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather um and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine\n[noise] absolutely yeah and ah you know Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um\nSince two thousand and ten a the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight um and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers\nIt just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get jobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where\nThe issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict do to my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so it does it all sort of\nAdds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now a ... it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet um but it's it by all accounts of very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent\nI'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about and overheating of the economy that would start to\nAh turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now uh back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see my reading of Bloomberg News thank you thanks German\nIntent is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and this John Connelly also came out the his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the army you can put any differences aside and come together accomplishment great thing and that's exactly what\nI'm about to prepare for that means nothing reader corporation\nCatherine Richard tell us more about seeing [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never started in public office before um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently pointed that out so he's moved back to the district to run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats as a moderate district and you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWell none of the Republican Jim how you doing in his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington wins or government are so certain rather than a Trump can't pull on fast enough\nRunning for Congress to health and rip out the regulations Obamacare and ...\nSo Catherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's the thought on that\nHe has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and ... is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager and lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan Finn he has lived outside of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "05"}
