so far\nThe latest address to senator Cory Booker and to the former director of national intelligence James Clapper NPR's Quil Lawrence has been following this story Quil what do we know about the man who was arrested earlier today\nAh his name is ... uh fifty six years old he's from uh Ventura Florida just north of Miami\nOr possibly born in New York but has lived in Florida for several years he's a registered Republican he has a criminal history in Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One including\nA theft and fraud charges um and ah what's perhaps the most telling about him if uh the the media reports and the ... the pictures we've been seeing of his van are in fact his is just a a\nA a political manifesto written on the side of his white van in stickers ah where he ah has a lot of references to vice president uh parents and of course President Trump or and also against George Soros\nI'm so I'm looking at his social media you can see that he's a very much involved in politics he tweeting about uh the governor's race against the Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum down their\nPolice were said to have known about this man is he saying he had a criminal past you know what it is that led to stories directly to him\nThere had been uh some focus on Florida as where these packages had been mailed from\nA very quickly and a experts have been talking about the amount of evidence that might have been left behind because these packages included tape and plastic bubble wrap that there could be fingerprints as well as possibly DNA I'm so authorities were were moving\nThere could be fingerprints as well as possibly DNA I'm so authorities were were moving very quickly on this and we're focusing on Florida and we can assume that they tracked from the the or possibly from surveillance cameras at at the post office where they found that some of these packages might have been sent from but it's early days\nAnd we'll do you have any idea and just how he was arrested or was he with the vehicle that um that they took away at the time was he considered dangerous when they arrested him\nUm we know he was arrested at about eleven o'clock this morning in a parking lot of shopping center and plantation Florida which is just outside of Fort Lauderdale\nUm you know there was some street shutdown around there are and there was this white van which was towed away covering stickers ah people on social media have been tweeting\nPictures of that white van because it was such a a a noticeable vehicle or people who had seen it in traffic and and taking pictures of it to

scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in ... you were on Easter Island in July when you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning um I had not followed hurricane a lock I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a\nHead into French ... and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures in here and now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a\nUndergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant for the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system\nAs small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles 'cause I'm digs their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being the the style in which was the largest one uh that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are\nWithout it yeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the ... area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turned to the north to some of the other ... ah there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... sand did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to as much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes the that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are that are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening\nThe most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that yes\nIt was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice islands\nAre at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average when speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour and um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... since last year as hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand\nUm was a moved by the hurricane to the north\nAnd north east the trade when waves\nMay push that stand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling sea level around two thousand years ago\nWe are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming this island or don't exist\nThat chip Fletcher and a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you\nOn the conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven asked it\nMcGrath and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody but our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing chowder easy executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work\nHe says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in rent and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to rethink be searched shifting the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that shipped about\nThe way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics is not so much what do we want growth do we want less growth it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do a nice pair of comparison right um they are very high growth rates in China we are very high growth in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is\nA lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution of means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently off is this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change gets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting\nOften this conversation about climate change gets ...

with Bill for example about the album this spring he's appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solar this time around\nBut that's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment I picked up a guitar\nThere's the social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person and awkward but with that guitar it was like this magic wand that she should bring every one together and so all along the guitar has been about interacting with other people\nI Know there's you know this is the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter alone troop adore when it first you know but it's something that sort of\nTradition or whatever with a especially with with the singer songwriter alone troop adore when it first you know but it's something that sort of hanging out there in front of me that I Try to\nI'm just trying to get it together to be able to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech collect that like talk about a nightmare situation\nIf you could only have hadn't interact with you\nYeah yeah I mean can you tell a thing as long as I've got that in my hands and everything is\nCool so then why another solo album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself in here\nTo another level yeah I don't want to make it sound like that either it's because over the years it's become\nJust another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play something alone and it was really just\nSo uncomfortable and it was a drag and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get this together so\nA year later I tried it again and then I and they kept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually\nDo this and\nIt started to feel like [noise] like music [noise]\nWell it seems like the right time to talk about I think\n\n\n\nSo when the sun like this what comes for the notes or [laughter] sounds backwards the inspiration for the notes because you say it's it's a tribute to the musician the platelets in your life and you're done\n[noise] the notes or [laughter] it sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the notes because you say it's it's a tribute to the musician the platelets in your life and you don't usually it's just a\nA melody just a very simple you know what I'm saying I'm\nWriting it but then\nOne thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nCalled pretty stars and then they just shine and that was something I quote unquote row\nThese defined that book and the album ... and then made to shrink anything when I wrote it I recognize that it was a very very common courts when\nPrior to the recording of his album I was playing at this club called the stone in New York and I was playing some of the music that I Would record it played that song and a guy at the club one night he said oh I Love that was a really great version of\nJessie J what what do you talk about something just to\nPlay you this recording and it was like oh my God that's the same exact almost exact same malady and then I checked it out and it was like you know it's just an old traditional songs like\nI'd probably hurt the keys to treat you play it when I was five years old or something like a month is going to make him yeah and I'm I'm I could be in trouble now but I think it's\nYou know it's like a public domain kind of thing and then there's so much music float around I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing or am I remembering it or what is it\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nI'd love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want a let's listen to a\n... ... ... ...\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one court that I play the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen and sustain the man I\nWent through some other processing so there's sort of a drone\n\nOne now\nThat was originally from the guitar and then that's going to [noise] like a fire drop into pedal that's really kind of a shaky [noise]\nBut then I'm using that as the backdrop for\nJust the one I saw all over

you're playing or ... yeah well the composing is you know have these now these are\nPieces\nThey never feel like they're finished anyway but what I did to prepare for the album was actually played six night at the stone in your every night I brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither old compositions of mine or new ones and I tried to keep myself just off balance for that whole wheat\nAnd that's what I wanted to continue on into the studio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really know anything when I went in there\nYou know for somebody who sounds like you would in your younger days high behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusually difficult uncomfortable place intentionally\nOil but that's when the stuff really happens I mean that's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming and you jump off a cliff\nAnd you you just start flying and that's the best feeling with music for me is when you can take these chances but I say jumping off a cliff but\nLike what's gonna happen if you play a wrong note well okay you know you get all the thrill but you don't get banged up too much", "year": "2018",
