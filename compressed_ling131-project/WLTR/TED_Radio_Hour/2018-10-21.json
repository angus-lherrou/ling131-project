we start today with an account of two communities one is liberal the other conservative\nI Want you to guess which is where\nThe schools with stress [noise]\nPatriotism and respect\nIt would be a very rural base an educational\nPatriotism and respect [noise]\nIt would be a very rural face a educational system how is this would be fairly similar the\nLawns would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully green and mowed the town of the class with lots of churches that's found one [noise]\nHere's counter to the schools would be based more on stereotypes all kinds of things rather than than real memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those in churches and that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to them so how did these two towns which I guess today refer to as liberal and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine\nThat our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national security but what if I told you there's something deeper those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\n\nOn a regular basis right before and uh\n[noise]\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon articles with me about how science\nProves that the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter live say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscures something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn ... is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he's coauthor of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences\nThe word Laura or heard the word ... but this idea that you know the way that we see here's something must be the way everyone else sees that and there's just this feeling of auditor disbelief than other people might not see and hear the one of the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I Do think that's something we need\nHere's Republican Donald Trump they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi react constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream like shoot down here in the first place ...\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these our politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think you know immigration defense or police law and order I think this is really at the core of of who we are not the quarter political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police\nOr I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted of the president's wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense is that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\n\nThere are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual of a political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nTango from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just an level by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin conduct ... which is a common way of seeing if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content\nBut we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative\nThat is true there have been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we had the most luck with a picture of mutilation ... uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about that well we would look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly\nAccurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that liberals brains when they looked at a mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the ... to ... century\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the ... to ... matter of sensory too and that's the part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century true with the active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of some of these stepping on a rocky now goes right through there for us the matter of sensory too it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation Madison's for two and conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hard and uh just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nA really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins\nIdentical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin parents raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same\nIs it grew and fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology non environment is the driver\nI asked John what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data sets a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda needs a long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject to these data to the standard\nTwin design approach we did indeed uh find that their political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes misread this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic\nThat obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not in zero but apparently that was enough that at some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer laying in the political orientation of identical twins then into political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you\nThat there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us\nPolitical views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all this this work up besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have with fresh inside\nA and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we're able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talk to me about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handedness you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this is a long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people uh realize that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics\nIf we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather were oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because we didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many\nConflicts doesn't make sense because we didn't always have this deep divide in our country\nBetween liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was off into the leftist a more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a shortage of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had this very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats\nThe south never submit that she really Asian and degradation ration of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nIt's not a newspaper and express what many were feeling in the country at this\nShe is the Naga ration of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nAnd it's on the newspaper and express what many were feeling in the country at the time [noise]\nSouthern states were starting to seat it was the eve of the civil war one of the civil war brought ... to an end David still things of this moment as an example of destructive conflict that's because the conflict wasn't results of the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se he wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand\nAnd that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery\nThey put that head of the democracy so now the conflict just to sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible source of weakness and the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of\nAmerican history the answers been yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nWondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually went into ...\nOne of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of that the all ... it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong\nThere's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far\nYou're willing to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family writes a family we have every family people fight they coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the luck breaks down then actually the conflict convict the family part [noise]\n\nYeah the twentieth century

historian David moss\nI think what was so brilliant about\nKing but also before him if you look at the along the line from the early twenty century the N. double ACP was trying to think about how do we make change and what they thought was we're going to embrace democracy we're going to hug democracy tightly and we're going to reveal the hypocrisy [noise]\nStill believe about I end the pension funds and the grid about opportunity is late\nSo we've come to cash this check a check that will give up the pun demand the riches of freedom and the ... just to [noise]\nI think what leaders of the civil rights movement figure it out is that ... actually can be a plus not just a minus so if you can bring it out if you can expose that if you can put it in front of people and show that the principals they hold dear are being violated\nThat in some cases at least forces people to choose sometimes they choose wrong unfortunately but sometimes actually side with principals so this is basically a what Martin Luther king was trying to do he he wanted to pick some of the most challenging places to protest Birmingham, Alabama Selma\nKnowing that there were um some some pretty tough people on the other side some pretty brutal of a police and sheriff's on the other side who are going to take that opportunity to beat up\nUm some some pretty tough people on the other side some pretty brutal of a police and sheriff's on the other side who are going to take that opportunity to beat up the protesters used dogs water cannons so so what he realized is\nThat if if you could make people in their living rooms see this violence and and bring it out you know into the light of day then suddenly the ... which unfortunately was at the heart of the country at that point we were talking about equal protection but we weren't living equal protection [noise]\nWithout television I don't think you could possibly have done it but with television he was able to go ...\nMarketing peacefully protest peacefully and the reaction do came and it came as widely from the other side and then put on display supporters and\nAnd then ... and rising rate body no city state and they just said it body can firmly news with Adam\n... so what you need once again is this link between conflict tied to this deep faith in the democracy even how imperfect in perfect is an understatement\nMm Nick ...\nOne hundred years later\nA life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the amount of memory dated them in\nAnd saying that when you think about some of the other leaders of the time there were certainly people who were advocating some portion of what the south was saying and Eighteen sixty one there were people who are saying look the system is so broken it is so\nFaulty that there is no fixing it we actually have to break it down and I think the point that you're making is truly when me which is that king wrapped himself with flak he writes\nThat there is no fixing it we actually have to break it down and I think the point that you're making is truly well me which is that king wrapped himself in the flack you wrap themselves in this ideal of the American democracy and that potentially is what made the conflict productive\nRight so look you know there were a lot of things he was concerned about but he said let's take these principles and actually try to see if we can all live by them mhm\nMhm mhm I think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and his generated tremendous progress economic progress social progress political a lot slower than we'd all like by\nBoys things can go very badly and we all know that and so the question is can you continue to make progress [noise]\nSo which of these historical analogies describes the current moment in the United states are we on the brink of a new chapter in our democracy\nOr on the brink of divorce\nI asked David about a number of more recent developments
