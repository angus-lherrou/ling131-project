serendipity new research suggests they reveal important things about how our minds work and they have a far more powerful effect on our lives than any of us imagine\nA couple of months ago we are

fascinated by coincidences and could listen for hours the stories about them but what is it that so fascinates us about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley thinks he might have one answer\nHe's the author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how they thinks about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to your first [noise]\nAt least book examines how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise] this is a remarkably useful skill ugly sometimes miss apply it we sometimes attribute intention entity to things that aren't even living [noise]\nEspecially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day but we give hurricanes I'm name Katrina Sandy\nAndrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina the mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America [noise] this is a new\nFor centuries people have described in ... to natural forces we think's charms droughts and earthquakes must have a mind set around\nThis general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do\nTurns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people it was a good way to learn about each other is a good way to explain why are the people did something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of sites\nOr intent or or meaning is often quite a successful thing to

the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random event some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern a that crops up that might not in fact have have a mind behind that\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways what we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable\nLike you couldn't anticipate its actions\nThat's when people described it reported that have had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance uh billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls often they're predicted direction where you don't you\nDon't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain in these cases sometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there's a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute a mind or something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain what's going on in this uh\nFor instance uh billiard ball sitting on a table and other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls often they're predicted direction where you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on a table and suddenly starts

controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute of mind or something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain what's going on in this uh autonomous and this autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an age of behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set up\nThis underwater Roomba for the lack of a better time to clean the bottom of the pools as it rolls around the bottom of the pool and it goes and just completely random fashion right so just runs a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and\nI find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next makes it just more interesting and more alive in a way than something that moves in a very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well\nNow it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly ... start to get a little sense of of mine that people are crazy you don't\nYou don't think it's like your mother writer or your your in your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming or the living room but it starts to look just a little bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people actually\nDo name that ... you can buy outfits to dress it up or if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of\nThey're a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly ... start to get a little

bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people actually do name that room but as you can buy outfits to dress it up\nOr if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of\nPeople thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nI Want to talk to that have been about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stop and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happens was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of ... different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\nUm but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\nThen he fell in love with a reflection of himself modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of noxious is you know\nMost of us like people who reminded us of ourselves whether that's someone with the same name or someone with the same but most of the time such tough love is amusing and homeless maybe even beneficial a sign of good self esteem\nBut there are times when falling in love with ourselves with people who remind us of our cells\nCan be a real problem [noise] rent time as a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland\nThe study something called implicit eco tourism\nWhich is the idea that many biopsies are unconscious and one very well studied bias was you get to some value in the so favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there are several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nWe originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get\nAnd one very well studied bias was he gets ... value in the self favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there's several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nSo we were originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry\nBut we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great director ease of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on his paper and they're now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brett looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names for the recently released Nineteen forty cents is joined salmon if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as butchers miners working as minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every\nSurname there is a currently at the top two thousands are names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to see of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name ...\nTwo thousand names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're Lebanon them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a\nI think it was a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from families who were in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both names and the choices\nQuite possibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations there is a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance as he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality\nYou're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter Marin County farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent them as looked at large data sets in public records like the Social Security death index or state marriage records databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds\nOf funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as uncommon to see my thing\nBeyond what you might expect by me a chance there's about a seven percent bias in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing this\nRent them as looked at large data sets in public records like the Social Security death index or state marriage records databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen\nAll kinds of funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as uncommon as you might think\nBeyond what you might expect by me a chance\nThere's about seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them ... as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shave for everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these smaller facts over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nBread says that if you really love your birthday the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so have you got married on the thirteenth of the month you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday number\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name oh you'll but he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names and our butts days and have positive associations with them\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that and the the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish is there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle names you know the the joke about that is the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble and my additional kind of know if he might be a serial killer someday right in the middle name is ...\nCall home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days

to publish is there's one part of people's names I don't like that much and that's their middle names you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble\nAnd my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer someday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same but day if you were born on April twentieth you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to\nRead finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly bailed you are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Brennan I was talking I realized something a little uncomfortable that I myself\nHad fallen prey to emphasize that he got his you know as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was ... my name and he actually taught a\nPhilosophy that is known as ... and I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that it'd be very interesting and the fact\nThat Shankar taught that philosophy I thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you said this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit equal to read\nHis work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in the objective leave a message and at
