harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once that the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest

welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just

circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager I Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly

your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me um maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSuicide already interesting because these professionals in some way to get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people\nFighting about so it's really interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know their clients better than the ... own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm telling me a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand finance and the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup about what kind of person becomes the wealth manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter] you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but\nAlso a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack 'em around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou're right in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of ... called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story\nSo this is one of the first stories\nI heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told this story over lunch of receiving a phone call from my clients who is in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant\nSome managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story so this is one of the first\nStories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told this story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom a client who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it and the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter]\nSo imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely\nApproaching a location so you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix a problem like this but Eleanor somehow did she she determined where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy\nTo pay ... there are some times ah clients do make request like this not because you're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said on on your wealth manager not in your face\nTo use or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the client said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon\nAnd David said on on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the client said well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story it I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon\nI just needed to see that you had the\nConnections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they're not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and where were children
