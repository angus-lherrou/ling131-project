them into the White House [noise]\nThere's only one part in that finally someone that's not a politician\nApproval of these voters often white and often working class has meant the Republican Party as

belittled and ignored and you know what some level they're right\nThe other is more critical race as we all know is such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage [noise]\nJune William studies gender up class and work in the United states just currently professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of law she's also the author of the book white working class overcoming class ... in America Joan welcome to read and write\nDelighted to be here we've heard a lot about the white working class since that twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income\nAnd then the top ... their professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income um and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class\nUm and I had to find that as top twenty percent by household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle ... fifty three percent within median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nAnd also it shows that that I needed to to keep close to home in a small circle of friends and acquaintances who knew know she's\nThat I needed to keep close to home in a small circle of friends and acquaintances who knew no he's not just the guy who sells Israel it's his social on her is not portable\n[noise]\nJones says blue collar family sphere resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her\nShe told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's so low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford to shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the ... she was in head start she was teaching and ... as a head start teacher\nSome of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute to her in daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying\nWhite Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor and they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen this kind of hard living drug sex rock and roll\nUm didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise]\nUm didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise]\nJones says working class people have come to us you know government benefits and government programs are not for them\nWhen her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia [noise] Jones suggested to her mother in law actually apply for some help\nHer reaction was striking [noise]\nMade her reaction was oh I'm not even going to bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us he just cares about the poor\nAnd in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they deliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption you\nKnow it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people who are designing the programs and all the political elites to make sure that Americans know that and they had seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book\nIs that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan in their outlook and people who are not us oh they're going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to that community in a way that's very different\nAnd in some ways they resent the people who are accustomed politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there is that it does map on to class but brags it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that\nIt does map on to class but brags it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did I'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump bought the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted both for ... and for Trump where those people who were left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people\nWho have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nDay actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\n[noise] when you think about the ways a blue collar America and the leads relate to the work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange does your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display but it's also a form of saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\nWork it's what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to\nSupport your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by their jobs\nYou know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie um this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives\n\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many rather do people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out on the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nTo college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course college debt is what could tripled I'm In recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college or many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up paying\nA much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from non elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical school will record and one from an elite family in one from a ... a white working class family\nThat white working class family has a kid has to actually be about three times as good as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jong says researcher sent out two sets of resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo cut sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway\nJoan Williams argues obese class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in politics when we come back we'll explore different theories about why the white working class to the twenty sixteen presidential election Donald Trump\nI'm Shankar based on them and you're listening to hidden brain\nIn class tip the twenty sixteen presidential election Donald Trump\nI'm shocked that them and you're listening to hate him right this is NPR\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\n[noise] Mm [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWhich means to suggest then that it was\nImmigration that was explaining partisanship as opposed to vice versa\n[noise] let's step back for a second and just paint a picture of how you've arrived at this thesis or you say that since two thousand the United states has absorbed an extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways and will be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California Texas we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do use families as you pointed out a calling for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of friction and tension that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show more as a house\nElation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected we'd walk polls show more as a house with white Americans seem to believe that immigrants sort of burden to us society and it's like majority saying that Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise]\nThese threats come in different forms [noise]\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political threats\nWhy Republicans on the hill understand the threat of these policies posed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift you also have these increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxiety of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really taken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have a\nCentral message such as immigration\n... their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have a central message such as immigration\nThat can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for there's been some criticism that well this is a short term strategy and if they're going to\nThey're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou won't you looked at what happens in states as the demographics of St start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters [noise] well what\nYou typically see is that as the population of a\nLatino voters have increased you start to see the shift in\nThe political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh [noise] that would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor in all of these different\nPolitical outcomes that we were exploring and so I think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in today\nThis idea that it was really this white backlash towards

campaign\n[noise]\nAt the time were so many pundits that Trump was running a campaign that was out of touch with a diverse America but but um anyway as your book shows you was actually running a campaign that was perfectly in touch with the anxieties of white voters\nThat's right I think what ... Smith says that Trump is in trying to attract all voters across the United states he knew exactly what demographic and what base he was speaking to and so again with these kinds of\nEmotional appeals that are tied to a specific group of individuals that pitch that message resonated as we all know now extremely well with his supporters and I think it was compounded also by the fact that we had eight years in Obama presidency and so it's immigration\nAlso tied in with the issue of race and this is why\nThe subtitle of our book is immigration race and politics because the two things ... if they at least in the context of the United states they go hand in hand with one another and so you have\nEight years of the presidency of the first African American person in this country coupled with uh the\nIn hand with one another and so you have eight years of the presidency of the first African American person in this country coupled with at\nThe specific campaign message of immigration a altogether tongue in a lot of that racial resentment that happened in the past eight years I think that just is what galvanized his campaign and his presidency\nSo one wonders chopping implication from your thesis Morris has a bit heading to a situation where we have different political parties for people of color and people who are white or an an increasingly what this means is that our political devised become racial divide\nIndeed and that's a one of the ah again more pessimistic outcomes of this research is that really you know race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society but I think also Republicans willingly took on that strategy\nAre using it to their advantage clearly [noise] there's an interesting\nTension here it seems to me for both the Democratic party and the Republican Party you know we we alluded to this sometime earlier but what might be the interest of each party in the short term might not be in its interests in the long term can can you talk about that from the point of view of both the Democratic party and the Republican Party\nShore I mean for the Republican Party right now they're an overwhelmingly white party and as we know with the way demographics are shifting in the United states we're going to become increasingly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Columbia", "day": "28"}
