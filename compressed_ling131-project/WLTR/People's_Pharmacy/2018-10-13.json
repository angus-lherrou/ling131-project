come from and so\nHaving spent a lot of time looking at Nike's ads my first thought was like okay this is totally part of this tradition of moving the needle with kind of controversial branding that places sports in athletics in the context of something bigger\nOnly a games Martin Kessler takes it from here\nIn the ... moment Petra zealous says Nike's tradition of socially conscious branding goes back all the way that the seventies when they released their first women's running line they named their shoes after kind of\nAll these like cause I feminist sayings so you know there's like the

guess that means you're playing the role of the person who is not excited about this baseball season I'm a bit of a loved about everything\nAnd you know [laughter]\nTake it away I'm super excited about the red Sox which made being in the press box when they claim strictly I got to\nGot to bad luck by like couldn't watch for the end of the ninth inning because I was so nervous and then either freaked out and they want\nCertainly I got\nI got some bad luck by like couldn't watch for the end of the ninth inning because I was so nervous and I was freaked out when they won and I was like this is wild land you know and like that\nDid you on cork champagne or whatever\nIt was like cracker jacks wind up in the air and the ... um no but I think\nYou know I was super invested in in the LDS as I think a lot of people were because you know Yankees Red Sox first time meeting in the postseason since two thousand four when I was also really invested but what was interesting to me about the series is that I went into it assuming that every with than would be jazz for the rivalry\nAnd yet when I went to send way and Yankee Stadium also I found that fans weren't as dedicated to hating the other team as I expected them to be\nDo you think that part of the issue I mean besides the fact that the dragon was slain afford but also the red Sox and the Yankees these current teams are kinda likeable didn't have enough jerks the red Sox Yankees they need more jerk for that rivalry to be really if\nThey know Jason that exactly what people said at Fenway they were like we don't have the same characters you know there's there's not a lot and not to like about an hour and a\nLot more for going in a locker\nRoom and I get yelled at by Yankees PR for trying to talk to them and judges like sorry like he was very nice about it\nAll right Jason what do you think\nI think the Houston Astros fares are going around they were so annoyed that they had to play all their games I Wonder where they play their games in a in the morning for the roads are than the Yankees are playing prime time after a sort of fed up with all those east coast media bias\nSo speaking of east coast media bias we should acknowledge the media bias of this panel which is we are three Red Sox fans right I mean Jason doesn't care about anything\nTo do here and I said in like I had a lab you're you're\nWe are three Red Sox fans right I mean Jason doesn't care about anything\nTo do here and I said in your your your all you were wearing Red Sox Jersey so it's just join and get out and I wanted to have roosters [laughter]\nI'm not even going to pretend care and I'm I'm a Homer\nBut Jason what you just said about being said is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like there too and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nWe're never satisfy Karen\nHadn't the game you realize care\nAnd that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox like okay fine it was just it it may have waited long enough\nOf the children All right so I Want to move us out of New England and talk about Jenny butler he had an exciting return to Minnesota December ... practice on Wednesday\nButler's looking for a trade and to facilitate a trade he reportedly played brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me and my father's name I'm sure that's what you're going to do and saga lives\nOther they is it not the right way for it to come to think it was the wrong thing to do well okay thing to do I think that\nI was on okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do what I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes but as for us\nIt's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all the athletes but has frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids are going to do what you do so it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK\nCharlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when the NBA\nVentures into WW story so I'm gonna let you go home or you know we do a little concerned\nAbout viral worried about my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler knew exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue\nI Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like man but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on ... campus for this melt down with advanced warning was somehow a bit of choreography on team bottlers part\nI don't want to say I said that but I didn't\nCare and also I have seen you walk into the studio saying you believe in a [laughter]\nDon't know if you are one of the cast stones you know this is where the NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like the marvel comics universe where these players are kind of superhero like and they have enemies both on their own squads Anon squads elsewhere\nI I'm just going to leave it at you know Charlotte and made the point that the media is being used here and\nHe's both on their own squads and on squads elsewhere\nI I'm just going to leave it at you know Charlotte made the point that the media is being used here and as a member of the media I'm just going to say hey I don't like the news really\nAnd like okay we'll give me those clear\nYeah yeah just just just use me Phil whether our gang you probably know that once more the Alabama Crimson Tide of the number one college football team in the country and you surely know at Alabama head coach Nick Saban hair is once again so key unless it's really nice\nBut all is not well in Tuscaloosa because those ... good for nothing Alabama students are getting increasingly ambivalent about attending one sided football games once more Nick Saban is on a war against his own student body we're talking friendly fire\nFor their paltry attendance at Crimson Tide football games\nHis poor Crimson Tide players look up in the stands in the middle of the games and it looks like a Miami Marlins game up there\nBut here is a thought for Alabama play some exciting football games that begin at reasonable times Nick Saban actually got himself worked up about the student crowd at a football game that began at eleven am Charlotte\nOn a Saturday does he realize that it's legal\nFor a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter]\nAlso Alabama was playing in Louisiana Lafayette I mean no no disrespect to Louisiana Lafayette but do you know what the score was at halftime what was the score it was seven hundred and Ninety five thousand on the [laughter] okay I was forty nine to nothing it was forty eight to nothing about half\nPart of this is a little weird if I take I realized pardon me kind of Caesar he's coming from\nIt's not that good forty either nothing about half\nPart of this is a little weird of a take I realized pardon me kind of Caesar he's coming from okay I Want to hear and I do because like here's this\nTeam that you have you've devoted your life to making this insane powerhouse and you are the best college football team that has maybe ever existed and then people stop going to your games I'd be like\nI like are you kidding I did this for you I mean\nI also did it for the millions of dollars and the prestige and the chance to you know do whatever I Want after this but I Do kind of understand what you're you're a fancy\nParents traveling Sports Illustrated corresponded now you've been to these major college events you know that big time college boards of two thousand Eighteen the last thing that has anything to do with\nOur students boosters vision and prime sponsor okay here's a thought maybe they should pay the students to go to the game\nAs I you know the first year of grief it's really hard and I find myself reaching\nAll over the place to grab things I remind me of him and the one thing I don't\nWant

most WNBA stars where men signatures shoes what gifts\nBut now it's time for the week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie hold your women you only want to talk about issues speaking of shoes that will be a Seventy sixer synergy oil and beat has signed a five year deal with Under Armour\nIt'll making the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote there is a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that because she's look really weird and aside Seventeen\nI mean speaking as someone who bought at a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on which I Believe we're using his car for now [laughter]\nThe problem with with ... they looked fine on the big men right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey looked like art object [laughter] but if anybody can do it it's Joelle envied who has charisma beyond belief um so I mean you're going to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway thanks for myself like a guard I mean you might think of his own the Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is yeah\nSenator anyway he thinks of itself a guard I mean you might think of his own to the Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this was in the world is\nYeah I mean he said I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but he said he can do at all which I guess means you can shoot\nWeapons which means the coaching staff of the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers are just had a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked you\nYes what struck me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm of the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bride big enough\nTo make me care about this bribery trial it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is just silly the players are the ones who are going to get hurt most and the NC double a which was on the ropes and staggering has now found its way back to what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking of the players are the ones that get hurt in New York Times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutor say the victim is the university's\nFans might say at us but the New York times suggest that it's Bryan tags Bowen whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia\nWell there's nothing wrong with playing in Australia has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian Bull is going to be fine I think he's going to do as a friendship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high\nBut again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized by these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel Charlie last week\nUniversities haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on the show we learned that the woman who is accusing event is dark Christiana Ronaldo of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document and which Fernando admitted to non consensual sex\nNow we're in all this lawyer is saying that document was acquired and a computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the eight thousand reasons why I didn't go to law school I think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove the thing was hacked\nThat sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden otherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr and all those who is capable of buying a lot of forensics\nYou've written a lot and your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is to figure out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I really get ...\nCan we ... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean it's a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instinct and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just banning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nInstead they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our

will not connect with the black people their insulting it's a good idea you know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson

this sort of thing going on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what was mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe wasn't [laughter]\nOrder but it'd be Wyoming by the way in this game Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald he
