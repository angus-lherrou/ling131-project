the beer thank you Karen [noise]\nSo I don't normally followed the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psychosocial\nAnd no surprise football was ranked at the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits and football would have been ranked number one for psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids were attracted to the dangers of football and I'm all questions and answers and ... what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play it in high school high school football scares me a ... just because all the research shows that when your brain is younger that's when it's the most vulnerable and the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that\nThe psycho social benefit seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nWell I I don't know if I have an issue of high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner like really little kids but I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community\nAnd you have the whole town behind you you know I Know from my years from cover in high school football uh no just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raises self esteem of the athletes to perform because you've got a list\nNo just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raise it self esteem of the athletes that perform because you've got eleven guys saw it on the field as one\nIf you played high school basketball the gym maybe Mt if you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across the country [laughter] but football\nI can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been just suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football instead\nThat they don't really need to tell 'em in the yeah and I'm totally brave alright and yeah yeah yeah and you know Tom rainy and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football flag football like would would that would that community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution pay to\nLead the G League is a now offer an alternative to the and she's one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospects from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is ...\nHere's old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for W. NBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness everybody signed with an agent\nBut there is a risk to this one being you're playing in the ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself from the perspective as you say in college when you're playing against guys are on age\nAlso the G League does not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players but just allowing them to have the ability to hire an agent to sell their likeness and decide shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the ... sort of one day waking up in deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing cool that\nProbably the best possible outcome\nFrom this right or at least as I see it wouldn't be\nThat the threat of\nHigh school players going to the ... league instead of being wanting diamonds would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] uh I mean I think the only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is is\nThe alternative is a good enough and that can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to do by if guys\nTurn it is is a good enough one that can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to do by\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think I could work but Michael you promised that we could talk about the WNBA issue so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these have high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really prove that something is a little off here and it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes and no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players\nYou know what I Do you know super it has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players and I'll leave that hasn't even like\nThey don't they're not even on to not only is he is and the fact that they would maybe Hawaii has a better television do you eat right\nRight I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one a minute [laughter]\nI totally agree I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love seeing her play and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we we reward mill um athletes\nMuch more significantly than we do females when we ... I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WMBA is significantly lower than eight to twenty five percent right and center ... sort of ... percent\nSo as it is only a game tradition we save our most important topic for last nor at you yeah I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am just\nFor the last ... who you yeah I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am just say is from a column for the spotlight investigative team\nI wrote a piece recently about touchdown and big play celebrations and it was kind of a something that the NFL has been letting players do a little bit more\nI Love when guys get really creative about it I went around and and did a little digging in the patriots locker room and pulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system ah how to look at a celebration and decide if it's up to snuff and I have a confession for you guys because\nWhat all the patriots players said was that you just can't celebrate when you're losing and this that actually happened during the cold got an interception a couple of weeks ago in a game and they were down by two scores and they started celebrating during this dad there you know towards the end zone cameras on them and obviously on TV you see the score\nNewest shouting choice would take a closer look here's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of your mouth crucial she was President Trump pitch the campaign trail and us mercenaries\nFor heart the M ward definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to the military operations combat targeted killing for the military of a foreign power Saturday on weekend edition from NPR News\n\n\n\nSupport for only a game comes from the listeners have W.

up to the Nazis well look at athletes who stand or sit or Neal in protest but now it's time for this week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie I guarantee\nIt's normal for us to start the segment by talking about USA Gymnastics but these are not normal times\nWe're going to take this week's developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday as Steve Penny the organization's former president did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common don't we start to segment we both argue about using true and for all the wrong reasons this\nGuys don't believe the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy Randall sports organization right and you know lamb and they have to track him down any gallons burger and they have to bring him back on smell taxes\nGrand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abused\nFor allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing document do you\nAs does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either at this guy's trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against usa ... we're going to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[noise] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was an which I never thought I Would do it again [laughter]\nRight right well she was announced last friday as USA Gymnastics new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first stop does the fact that means bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right next question [laughter]\nThe second issue to me as a bit more complicated in September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker to blackout the swoosh on her Gulf shoes\nAnd as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame I might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the ... in which Mary Bono is allow became qualified to run usa your true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you've alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first\nPlace I mean what USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nOlympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up to the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states in God no\nYou will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states in God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help itself\n[noise] Charlie you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised\nNo because we're smart caring and more people to listen to us [laughter] no I mean the basic problem the NFL had with the whole anthem thing was that three or four owners who were author reservation out of Jerry Jones\nBombing narrowed down in Houston a Gerges in in in Carolina those guys at print pretty much marginalize if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches and was cooler heads prevail\nOr they realize that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this they can afford to offend\nWhat I really love about this story is that they actually came up with actual data\nThat showed that treats made by the president didn't try fans off to football what turned fans off the football was those owners speaking up right\nAnd finally Charlie I Want to draw your attention she they can yeah ice lions because the country only has enough ice hockey players to field one team they had never played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news\nUh first of all I Want to Jersey Jersey so bad [laughter] apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play against the team of firefighters\nAnd then Crosby and McCain and played for the gang [laughter] ... which we don't do that the last story on our on our segment every week is usually a funny one this isn't a funny one this is an awesome\nFor the gang [laughter] ... which we don't get the last story on a on our segment every week is usually a funny one ... this isn't a funny one this is an author McKinney even that I guess you can't really put out which is pretty good considering most of them to skate before last year\nThere was a video because of course it's sponsored by a coffee company and my favorite but it's one of the Kenyan players reaches out and like pot Sidney Crosby on the face and says is it really you know [laughter]\nI've always been venture can fill hockey anywhere if you give it a chance you could do hockey in Kenya I
