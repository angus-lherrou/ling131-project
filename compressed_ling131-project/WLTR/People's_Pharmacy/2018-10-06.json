Thirteen ... weird season on Sunday they started the day with the best record in the national league forty eight hours later after two games at home they're finished\nYeah I mean we went a home game though you know I mean you know when it's going to run exactly right you know they kind of weird team all year though yes you know they went through these spells of what looked like apathy to me yeah fortunately one of those hit at the wrong time\nMobs of lately they scored one run or fewer forty times this year and still one Ninety five games so I guess they should get a medal for that\nYeah outside of the red Sox wanting a hundred and eight games with that Bolton that sat on the top just most inexplicable thing here\nIs incredible the only team to score one runner fewer more times than the cubs was the Orioles and they lost a hundred and Fifteen game winning and winning Ninety five with that sort of a ... is doing something there is news this week in a novel move\nCells of what looked like apathy to me yeah fortunately one of those hit at the wrong time\nMobs of lately they scored one run or fewer forty times this year and still one Ninety five game so I guess they should get a medal for that\nYeah outside of the red Sox winning a hundred and eight games with that Bolton that sat on the top just most initially will think of the year\nIt's incredible the only team to score one runner fewer more times than the cubs was the Orioles and they lost a hundred and Fifteen game winning and winning Ninety five with that sort of me and my coffins is doing something there was news this week in a novel move tennis channel will begin showing wait for it tennis\nMore specifically the women's tennis tour which went out on its own and the disastrous venture would be in sports for the last two years women's tennis outside of the grand slams has been virtually invisible meanwhile for the past five years many Los Angeles Dodgers fans haven't been able to watch the games and bear market because some cable networks won't carry sports Mitt LA\nWith the combination of court cutting in contempt you think people are realizing that life goes on or if you're just a die hard sports fan do you just wait forever until these corporations figure it out\nYeah I think both are true I also think there is another phenomenon going on that is the phenomenon of finding a way to be a fan without attending games that without necessarily watching on TV [laughter] I mean we always could be a fans were betting\nBut now you can be a fan through fantasy sports you can be a fans who memorabilia all kinds of ways to do what you can be a fan through media and nostalgia yep what this thing with the women's tennis thing reminds me most stuff is a phenomenally disastrous decision that the NHL made years ago to get off ESPN and not just for starting this\nRight or when they went to ... get a spike TV for the playoffs remember\nWhat it's like if he turned ... before that they went to sports channel you know they were ESPN's only professional league you at that time and time and he has the end it the more you know they did it I'm On the SPN they did what he SBN dot which is a high comes on the moon and then they\nBut now you can be a fan through fantasy sports you can be a fan through memorabilia for all kinds of ways to do what you can be a fan through media nostalgia yep what this thing with the women's tennis thing reminds me most stuff\nIs a phenomenally disastrous decision that the NHL made years ago to get off ESPN and not just for starting this right or when they went to ... but they got a spike TV for the playoffs remember that I went to like you'd be surprised before that it went to sports channel\nYou know they were ESPN's only professional league you have time and here's the ended up you know they did it among the SPN they did what ESPN does which is to hide them from the moon and then they moved on to sports you know that's what this reminds me of\nNow they made a big mistake and I think the good news is at least if you're a fan of WTO tenants than I Am ... I watched the women as much as I watch them and I'm happy that their back and you can actually watch them for the season\nAnd you know finally Charlie you know show would be complete without at least some discussion of the Cleveland Browns but here's a story about a different team a barn Iowa has a locked cooler full of Budweiser not Bud Light but Budweiser that it will open\nWhen the corn ... when its first football game of the season great idea right\nYeah I don't know I I don't understand why bar and I was doing this but okay they're just making fun of the Oscars that cooler is likely going to stay close for at least a week but here's my question what happened to Nebraska football if you are of a certain generation my late mother in law was from Stuart in Nebraska\nHer brother and her father and grandfather all played football for Nebraska\nI mean I think they've been crippled I think by conference realignment and by the fact that the whole nature of college football's changed the thing about those Nebraska teams was outside of people like Johnny Rogers and Tommy fresher they were big goons they would beat you to death you know over the all up and down the field\nThe game changed it to a very big people who are really fast and I don't think the press has never really caught up on that now we've come a long way since Tom Rath minute Roger Craig huh there you go you can find a sports writing I'm Charlie\nMy brother and her father and grandfather all played football for Nebraska\nI mean I think they've been crippled I think by conference realignment and by the fact that the whole nature of college football changed the thing about of debris asking changed was outside of people like Johnny Rogers and Tommy fresher they were big goons they would beat you to death yup over all up and down the field\nThe game changed it to a very big people who are really fast and I don't think it's ever really caught up on that now\nWe've come a long way since Tom Rath minute Roger Craig huh there you go you can find a sports writing of Charlie appears in Sports Illustrated from time to time and he joins us each week on only a game thank you Charlie banks are\n[noise]\nYou know the same game recognized game\nWhether it's Aaron Rodgers and Tom bringing the brawn James and Kevin Duran greatness knows when it sees it it's like a spider sense the same goes for the only game part we think you're a great and we're pretty good too so recognize our game by subscribing an apple pod casting or wherever you listen to fight\nIn while you're there and leave us a review you're helping listeners find our show and helping us raise aren't getting [noise]\n\nJimmy Connors maybe America's greatest tennis player Arthur ash maybe it's most influential\nThey couldn't stand each other ash really disliked anyone who had a kind of brag a do show anyone who trained himself in the way that Congress did that's University of South Florida professor and historian Raymond arsenal just wasn't one to attack anyway always gave everybody the benefit of the doubt\nBut as a member of his family told me once the only person that he really didn't like on the tour was Jimmy Connors one was brilliant but craving the other a quiet revolutionary with a powerful sense of patriotism here's only games\nMaybe it's most influential they couldn't stand each other ash really disliked anyone who had a kind of brag a do CEO\nAnyone who trained himself in the way that Congress did that's University of South Florida professor and historian Raymond arson oh he just wasn't one to attack anyway always gave everybody the benefit of the doubt\nBut as a member of his family told me once\nThe only person that he really didn't like on the tour was Jimmy Carter's one was brilliant but craving the other a quiet revolutionary with a powerful sense of patriotism here's only games Gary while like on their ashes clash with his greatest nemesis when that unfolded on and off the court the\nCoral between Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe probably began with the Davis Cup the annual international team tennis events\nDates back to Nineteen hundred ... was\nAccording to Raymond arsenal their attitudes towards playing on the U.S team were diametrically opposed\nThe ashes and met a tremendous amount to him because it affirmed his notion of self worth that he was a citizen a proud citizen and the the was respected enough to represent his nation\nAsh was the first African American to represent us in Davis Cup competition he had played on the U.S team in eight different years by the time Jimmy Connors was dominating men's tennis in the mid seventies but Connors refused to join the team this irritated ashes", "show_name": "People's Pharmacy", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "06"}
