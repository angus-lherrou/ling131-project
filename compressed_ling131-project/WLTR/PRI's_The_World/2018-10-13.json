Seventeen country music association awards sporting a tank top with a lyric written by her husband Jason is all about her it said mama wants to change that Nashville sound and she really does\nWe'll

that she's expanding her own sound\nOwen hey man that is my first lap as World Cafe host I mean the first person I've had the pleasure of interviewing twice since sitting in this here chair so that's exciting for me here we go\n... hours looking back to World Cafe glad to be back thanks for having me yeah we're thrilled to have you so we've been up playing playing the single leave it alone on a cafe we're going to hear you play it live here\nUm but I got to start off by asking you about the sound that we hear on this song musically it is such a different direction than what we heard from you on on my piece of land\nA so tell me a little bit about how you settled on the sound that we here has been percolating in your mind or did it come out of of jams are where the studio what\nWas it it was um it was like I guess it's twofold two part answer but um I wrote this whole record in my clothes closet\nIn my bedroom because I have it a little toddler and um as as much as she wants to play music and I enjoy playing music with her it's not the right environment to try and get anything accomplished so I locked myself in the closet and when I was in the closet\nCompletely alone and by myself with and\nGet anything accomplished so I locked myself in the closet and when I was in the closet completely alone and by myself with an instrument and a pen and paper all day I just started hearing fountains\nAnd that's how I decided on the sounds for the song [laughter] this sounds a little bit terrifying you're like you're in the closet by yourself you act in there with an answer in hearing what instrument did you bring in there with you what was it\nUm abrupt auto heart and violin and then a baritone ukulele know about my tenor ukulele because those things would fit in the closet with me and then if I wanted to change instruments I had to carry went out and bring the other one and you know\nIt's kind of like when you go to try and closed at a department store you have to like trade treat items yeah totally when their mind and bring another one and I love it well I Want to hear a little bit more about the the lyric writing process in the closet in a minute but first let's let's hear you play one of the songs that you came out of the closet with I guess that's okay [laughter]\nOkay here's ... that would leave it alone\n[noise] [noise]\nLee he\n\nLive here World Cafe breaking out the champagne that's Amanda shares my guest here on World Cafe her knee record is called to the sunset I'm On this record cycle you've got your own tour back um\nFor taking out the champagne that's Amanda Shires my guest here on World Cafe her new record is called to the sunset I'm On this record cycle you've got your own tour bus um can you explain for people who don't really understand why that's significant like what it means to have your very own\nTour bus it's the only thing it's the only thing like I've been touring around in a van since I was Fifteen um you drive all day when you're in the van and you get out of the van and you go to the show to load in\nAny ... any set up a player show you pack all your stuff back into the van then you drive\nYou know you might get home at AT T your hotel at two AM and unload the stuff and then you go to your hotel room sleep there for hours it's the same thing every day it's so monotonous and\nAnd exhausting and you get really tired and then you're still driving while you're tired and your friends are helping you drive and then the day you're trying to take take shift sleeping so having the bus is like you get in the bus you ride down the road during the night\nYou wake up in a town you get to walk around and experience to place loaded soundtrack do your show afterwards you put your stuff on the bus you can go you know have some dinner with your friends get back on the bus go to sleep the bus drives the next day you wake up somewhere else\nI met a shower is my guest here on World Cafe her new record is called to the sunset um is it this past year you walk the red carpet at the Emmy Awards wearing a shirt that I Want to talk about a ... a line from your husband Jason ... latest record from the song white man's world record with the Nashville sound um and I want to play that clip that dislike\n\nGive us a bit of a white man's world season is both a line in their mama wants to change that Nashville sound so you wore a T shirt with that line printed on it you're married to Jason I'm I should say people listening what does that line um where's that lend me do you\nUm it means to fight you know the fight for space for us as women and then the um the sometimes feeling of of futility against that it's impossible I guess\nYeah there's this great video that you posted of calling a radio station in in Knoxville to give them a piece of your mind after listening to the radio and noticing that they're only one or two women have been played out of like Eighteen songs but you just listened through um [noise] would you tell me what like what happened when you made that call\nI listen to Eighteen songs and I wrote down the name of everybody that you know was singing them and stuff and I just made the call and I was like hey can you throw in a\nAnother woman you know could we hear another few women's voices and stuff and and uh he was saying he said a bunch of stuff about how\nYou know you have to you have to like it on the Facebook and and then then then then they'll get to the possibility to be played in our like whatever the new faces or the new whatever our and I said\nYeah but can't you just played then I started lifting some country artist cages play some of these other awesome women like any place in case you must grades can you place them you know a little big town can you place them just name and um you know\nAnd then he also said but I Will get another one\nLike any place in case you must grades can you place them you know little big town can you place them just name and um you know\nAnd then he also said but I Will get another woman played on here for the next hour and I listen to a song number twenty eight and I called him back um oh wow and yeah I just it was\nIt was like mind blowing to me and aren't they generally like for the people I don't know where that is really should be they should be right and they'll pick up and I also think that we need to get away from\nThe fact that enough trying to do that with this record a little bit the fact that the only successful you can have like a country radio as not they don't want to be on it I don't care I'm not the person that decides those things but I Do I Do notice has a\nTendency for a woman sits on to be valid and kind of\nNeedy and let's get back to it man let's let's all just let them let us rock to
