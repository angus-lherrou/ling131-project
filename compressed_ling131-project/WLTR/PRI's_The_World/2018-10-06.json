human being a very busy artist you won't have a book coming out a nonfiction book of essays coming out in September\nAnd uh from what I can lean on line one of one of the essays is called the fool that bets against me and I was wondering if you could tell us I don't I don't want you to give away your book for free church that maybe you could tell us a little bit of that story because I think it says a lot about the way that you are\nAnd I was wondering if you could tell us I don't I don't want you to give away your book for free church shouldn't maybe you could tell us a little bit of that story because I think it says a lot about the way that you approach love and I want to talk about so a lot of the songs that I've written in recorded on my SOLAR Records have been torch songs and that's a\nThat's like a brand of song that's love sick and kind of pining in our relationship that isn't working out that was been good for my career and got a lousy for you know my head space for a lot of years and as much as you can write a sad love song like only so many ways to do it you know\nI remember I had a stomach ache I was reading my mail and I was lying on the ground because my stomach hurt and I got the Geico quarterly and a guy called quarterly is like a glossy magazine mailer and it's like um surprisingly well done for an insurance company\nAnd it and this particular issue they like ran down some unusual insurance policies so you know sometimes you hear about this and on TV or in a magazine that like some celebrity and shorter smile or legs or her you know or her chest or whatever and\nI was reading about some unusual policies like really unusual ones are big companies will ensure against um abduction for their big CEOs or somebody took out an insurance policy against the existence of Loch Ness monster and then and I know this rabbit only what does this and then I read about the insurance policy which was\nTaken out by this silent film star called Ben Turpin and he had crossed eyes\nAnd she insured has crossed dies because those were his professional ... you know he built his whole thing around them so he had like a car made that had crossed eyes and Everytime he hit his head really hard he'd rushed to the mirror to make sure that I hadn't gone straight\nAnd she insure them I think I Want to say for like\nAnd Everytime he hit his head really hard he'd rushed to the mirror to make sure that I hadn't gone straight and she insure them I think I Want to say for like twenty five K. and it was reading his policy that I thought okay well what would my thing be and in some ways\nI was disappointed to discover the like wow a lot of my [noise] my songs run on heartache like that's my cross dies you know the thing that isn't good for the man but was good for the film star\nAnd so from there I decided I Would uh see if I could take out an official insurance policy that essay the food that bets against me tells the story of trying to ensure\nThe heartache that was feeling a lot of these long wow he also did another really interesting with heartache um did another really interesting thing with heartache which was try to locate its source in your brain yeah um I watched a Ted Talk by a woman named Dr Helen Fisher\nIn in her work she had sent research subjects into an fmri machine and had them think about and look at photos of the people that they loved and she found that there was like a predictable pattern of\nActivity in the brain when you think about romantic love and that's different than like familial love her love for a pet like it has this really distinct signature\nEither those crazy and it never occurred to me that there would be like a a location where love would happen you know in your head yeah and uh if I thought well I've been struggling with with my own love sickness like if I could get into an F ... machine and find it\nIn my head maybe I could get it out so I partnered with a researcher at the University of Minnesota from there we decided to embark on a little case study to see if we could change the way that my brain was working and did it work a little bit it did work a little bit yeah you said something really\nDecided to embark on a little case study to see if we could change the way that my brain was working and did it work a little bit\nIt did work a little bit yeah you see something really interesting about free will and the first line of long I don't believe in free well is that I have for anything I don't believe my was quite free yeah so is that something that came out of I'm looking into your own brain and thinking about whether you had a choice in continuing to love somebody or not that's a great question I mean I think yes in part I mean\nWhether or not we all end up an fmri machine I think a lot of us have wondered like am I choosing to love someone can you choose to stop because if you can I don't know I don't know where that's I don't know where the brakes are exactly\nLike in some ways it feels like love is reflects of you know it's like you don't choose to kick when you get tapped with the little rubber mallet on your knees that's just how your belt [noise] um\nAnd I think trying to find the line of how much of our behavior is baked in somehow and how much of it as freely selected I think that we we let our ourselves and\nWe give ourselves a little more credit than we're do by imagining that our agency is larger than it is can you flip that and say that we are\nAlso give ourselves too much responsibility in the matter and and put pressure on ourselves to be ways other than\nHow we are I think yes but of course that's where we get into like really lousy a troublesome world territory yet right which is to say like oh if you can't help it then how on earth could you be held accountable like nobody likes that including me [laughter] I Know I don't like it either I don't even ask that question but it's like it it\nIt does have to follow that if that if\nThat if we think OK well like I Can't control the the bad oh then yeah then then what does responsibility look like what I promised keep it was like oh I hate it let's play the phone yeah let's ponder it while you prefer I mean but it gives away okay here's desert with Belgium\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nUm [noise] and
