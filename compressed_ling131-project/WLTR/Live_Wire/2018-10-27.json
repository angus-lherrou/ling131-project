Leo sequence letting go is something that I tend to have a hard time with it whether the topic is something really big or even something kind of small\nIn fact on my way to record this episode of live wire\nI had like a little run in at the airport that I had a hard time letting go of I was telling our announcer Elaine ... about it at the beginning of the show um let's actually pick it up right there on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland, Oregon tickle us\nVery day I was in the airport was flying down here to do the show and I went through security and my bag was passing through the scanner and it got flagged\nThey made an announcement over the loudspeaker we needed somebody to look at this bag they pulled it out they took everything out of the bag wiped it all down and couldn't figure out why the scanner went off\nFinally the guy realized it was because I have a water bottle like a clean canteen water bottle and it had and I'm not exaggerating five molecules of water still in it\nLike I had to actively dumped out the water but there was some residue in there and the guy said yeah you can't have that water wow and I looked at him and I said you know it for the safety of this flight I Am willing to dump out the water\nSaid yeah you can't have that water wow and I looked at him and I said you know it for the safety of this flight I Am willing to dump out the water\nAnd I'm not gonna take it on a plane with me uh so where do I do that and he said security rules are you can't do that on this side of security now you have to go back out to the other part of the airport dumped pure water out all five molecules get back in line and then come back through security\nBut he said he said or you can just leave the water bottle here\nBut I just bought it it was like twenty dollars [laughter] I'm pretty sure this is a scam by the TSA to get free water bottles and free ... plus over three ounces\nThere's always just like dead soldiers lined up from people who didn't want to and I was like you know what I'm putting the system on trial I Am going to do this I'm going to take the water bottle out through security and come back in and I was like can I leave my bag series like absolutely not try to get my bags back get my water bottle go out\nFind a bathroom dumped out the five molecules of water wait in line comebacks are and the whole time I was going through security I just mean that the essay guy [laughter]\nAnd also like a lot of people like to bring up people like in Carson or or Claudia ranking or I'm a are Ammons as reference points for

you end up passing rollout you've been collecting those up what are you seeing a\nYou had a hard time letting go of four pounds of bacon in my freezer [noise] it's been there for years but managers special ed Fred Myers can't pass up a good deal deals with like four exclamation points after it [laughter]\nI can totally relate to that there's a part of my freezer that\nHumanize have not even be

into freezer disrepair and my house really yeah no I mean really you don't even need a freezer when you bring home ice cream and I asked\nMe to uh do you have one more yeah here's one from I I think didn't uh\nThan in a has had a hard time letting go of over thinking it took me twenty minutes to decide on this [laughter]\n[noise]\nI was in and is here with whoever spilled wine on their cars that would be a good combine\nThis is live wire radio we are talking about letting go this week what about the idea of letting go basically every thing that you were raised to believe\nThat is exactly what a guy named Derek Black did when he decided to turn his back on wait for it the white nationalist movement it was a movement his father helped create\nHis journey of letting go is detailed in a series of articles in the Washington Post by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Eli sass low now has turned those articles into a book titled arising out of hatred please welcome ... [noise]\nYou know I Want to live or thanks great to be here um how did you first meet this guy dark black\nSo I was writing about doing root for the Washington Post and Don roofing committed the hate crime murder of about a dozen people at a historically black church in Charleston South Carolina\nAnd doing roof it spent time on this website called storm front and which I'd heard of but I didn't know very much about so in trying to understand the things that don't ... had been reading to sort of motivate him for this massacre I went on storm front and started\nThings that do in ... had been reading to sort of motivate him for this massacre I went on storm front and started reading this site it's the the largest racist website in the world and has been for two decades running\nAnd the biggest threat on his Web sites that there were plenty of people saying you know horribly celebrate tore things about Dylann Roof\nBut the biggest threat was about somebody named Derek Black and so I clicked on it and started to read and learned pretty quickly that there are black was the rising air to not only this website but also to this movement in the United states he was the son is the founder of this message board the godsend of David Duke he'd been raised and\nDavid Duke for those of you who've fortunately don't know who that is yeah you're lucky is a former grand wizard of the KKK\nYeah exactly and he had sort of made this guy dark black his protege and Derek being really smart and ambitious had been disastrously successful in mainstreaming a lot of these terrible ideas he'd been elected to office by the time he was Twenty years old\nHe had a delighted to what kind of office to a Republican committee seats and Florida and Florida yet or\nIn West Palm Beach Florida which is a pretty diverse place\nUh let me ask you a little bit about this sort of storm front thing and how related to this movement between what a lot of people would call white supremacy or the idea of being a white supremacist and something called the white nationalism\nBecause I Would think those are the same thing but actually dark blacks dad was a big part of trying to move from white supremacy to white nationalism\nWhat's the difference\nThey've worked really hard to change the language of this movement to try to sanitize it from a history of bloodshed but I think\nThe truth distinction that is helpful between white supremacy and white nationalism is white supremacy unfortunately is endemic to what the United States has been historically and is today and we're all still living in a country that was built unfortunately on a lot of white supremacists ideals white nationalist I think properly\nStarkly and is today and we're all still living in a country that was built unfortunately on a lot of white supremacist ideals white nationalist I think properly identifies a smaller group of people who are trying to separate races on two different continents as there and go\nBut like the idea to was that this guy dark black his father founded this website and was trying to make kind of an intellectual argument like be this sort of thinking persons racist\nYeah I mean he Derek father had also been the head of the clan for a decade in the United states and eventually decided it was more effective to build a gigantic website\nAnd eventually to ban all slurs from that website there is no Nazi insignia no racial slurs what they've tried to do is instead of speaking all the time horrible things about people with color and Jews is instead they're trying to speak to unfortunately the fairly widespread\nAnd factually incorrect sense of grievance that exist in part of white America\nI'm this kid dark black and I just kind of a passive observer to this like his dad is starting this website and he is going into forums on the Internet and popularized in his buzzwords like white genocide and things like that when did he actually start to realize that maybe this was not a good way to be living his life\nNot until he went to college and the ... in many ways had been indoctrinated with a lot of these ideas everybody who he lived with believe these things and had made it the cause for their lives and they pulled Derek out of the public schools\nAnd kept him sort of in the confines of white nationalism\nOh my gosh it's\nSo great to be with you guys in the end times how's\nIn [noise]\nIn a true sign of the apocalypse I joined a gym this year um [noise] I don't know what I think is pretty unusual reason I joined because at the age of thirty two I was

positions when I'm lying down on the couch\nI guess if that improved I'd be fine with it [noise] and the\nOh my God you guys he looked so really if he was just like okay so we want to lose some weight
