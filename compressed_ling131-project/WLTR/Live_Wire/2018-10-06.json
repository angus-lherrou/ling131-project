R. I. repeal burger rose theater in Portland this week our theme is on the contrary and we are talking to renting Francis Noone um Enrico galley on or you may know them from the dinner party download radio show in pod cast as well as their new book brunch is hell\nOn this book is sort of a a criticism of brunch but really it's a celebration of dinner parties thank you um what are the\nWhat are the are the keys to throwing a good dinner party you whether you wanted to or not you've kind of become the national experts on this topic because of your radio show in ...\nWell we wrote the book on it now literally wrote the book on it well I mean the first real dinner parties is right there in the title is to have dinner and the party yeah that's it\nNow that seems deceptively simple the point is there should be no agenda at a dinner party you can have a boss at a dinner party it can't be setting up people at a dinner party a holiday party isn't a dinner party because there's an agenda there a dinner party is really we considered recess for adults this is a place which is made up of less than twenty five percent of your family because with\nWith more than that there's an agenda taking place uh we we say suggest\nMore than that and my mom's in the corner yelling that Tim Allen of our of our friends right so\nIf we save save that for ... for Thanksgiving and I go to separate thing\nUm and so that's the rule number one is to have people in your home and asked them for nothing and just feed them um most of our lives we have to be a where employees were employers were in control or soccer coaches were doing all this stuff but this is the one place where you can let that go so those are the like the debates\nFor adults this is a place which is made up of less than twenty five percent of your family because with\nWith more than that there's an agenda taking place uh we we say suggest more than that my mom's in the corner yelling that Tim Allen of our of our friends right so if we save save that for ... for Thanksgiving and I go to separate thing\nUm and so that's the rule number one is to have people in your home and asked them for nothing and just feed them um most of our lives we have to be a where employees were employers were in control or soccer coaches were doing all this stuff but this is the one place where you can let that go so those are the like the the basics what now what elevates a dinner party\nFrom just meeting the minimum definition of a dinner party to being actually a good dinner party\nOh well I mean a lot of things come conversation would be a great thing to have what you're trying to do is get stories out of people and we and it's fascinating we actually have a quote from Alan Alda of all people who actually wrote a book about sort of the way people share information\nAnd industry when people tell stories their minds literally sync up like their their brains to light up in certain ways so that it's almost like a mind meld and with people so if you can get people to tell interesting stories you're actually sort of creating community and getting everybody literally on the same wavelength so why do you think\nThat the dinner party has declined in in ... maybe not popularity in people's minds but certainly in frequencies\nI think the rise of ... and has made people more interested in cooking but also made people uncomfortable to cook and invite people into their homes or we suggest that only fifty one percent of the food needs to be made at home you need over just fifty one percent just over the finish line there to make it a reflection of you and needs to be your food\nUh that's one thing the vents who I think people are I mean we're in Portland we wrote this from New York in LA or ... or apartments are small and I think people are afraid to bring people into their homes they feel like it needs to be perfect I think that's a present things id and I think that people have been lulled into this false sense of security that brunch and restaurants are really going to bring them\nInterested in cooking but also made people uncomfortable to cook and invite people into their homes or we suggest that only fifty one percent of the food needs to be made it home you need over ... just fifty one percent just over the finish line there to make it a reflection of you and needs to be your food\nUh that's one thing to prevent people I think people are I mean we're in Portland we wrote this from New York in LA or ... or apartments are small and I think people are afraid to bring people into their homes they feel like it needs to be perfect I think that's a present things id and I think that people have been lulled into this false sense of security that brunch and restaurants are really going to bring them full joy\nI got a couple of quick questions here um music at a dinner party or I Am\nOne of those people who will spend a day putting together like a six hour play list that I Want to just like Christian do with the scissors sisters cover of comfortably numb right is everyone's getting a little buzz yeah and then someone else wants to plug\nIn there I applied and because they have jock jams on there or something is are you a bad host if you\nKind of rule your stereo within with an iron fist at your own dinner party absolutely\nNot only that it's a musical dictatorship I absolutely for either urine controller you have any control over to one other person\nOtherwise it's an absolute free for all you know one moment you're listening to fly in the family stone another moment you're listening to ... which could be fun for the after party but not for the meal itself so you need to take control and I think you were wise to create a playlist beforehand and you can just set it and forget it\nWhat about children at a dinner party yours or your friends wanted to bring them there was an actual grown of\nThe [noise] children\nAh we we do we have said as we said before dinner parties a recess for adults who are not adults children but\nBut it is very important first of all we looked at it and it is important to to ... in coal train them to the pleasures of the foreman\nSo you need to take control and I think you were wise to create a playlist beforehand and you can just set it and forget it what about children at a dinner party yours or your friends wanted to bring them\nThere was an actual grown of\nJust [noise] children\nUh we we do we have said as we said before dinner parties a recess for adults who are not adults children but\nBut it is very important first of all we looked at and it is important to to ... in coal train them to the pleasures of the form of the dinner party\nI'm Glad to hear you say that Rico because even though I'm On one level it feels like it's for the adults maybe it's a little bit less fun if there's kids there I remember being a kid\nAt like dinner parties are for me it was like a lot of weird church potluck some prayer meetings but what you were a kid and you get to be around adults and observe them in their environment if you're a certain kind of get at least kind of get out what that was like everything to me\nAbsolutely but but and so the the catches here\nThat they should be old enough that they can take care of themselves so that they can observe from afar they'd do skinhead I over time and the kids can have so the kids need to be just old enough that they can entertain themselves without setting themselves on fire or ... and and like going to the bathroom and they have to be able to hold their liquor

[noise]\nObviously the book is brunch is hell renting Francis knew them Enrico galley auto everybody [noise]\nAlright Rico and Brendan your new book brunch as hell points out of what you guys see as the drawbacks of the brunch vacation of our culture on but what you don't really get into very much or the caloric repercussions\nOf branching it on the ... ah here's what we have done we have done some research on popular restaurant branches and how many calories\nThose breakfast and branches contain we're going to give you a caloric number 'cause you're the brunch expert so I ... you have to guess if that is over or under the actual calories in these breakfast ... calling it caloric over under a cow\nOver how\nWe view the did you get the amount game on [noise]\nIt's like schoolhouse rock but the schoolhouse became ... and turned into a restaurant I may say okay so this is a pretty simple\nGame I'm going to give you a caloric amount and you just have to try to decide and you've got to come to a consensus on this um that as the as the the authors of branches hell if you think it's over or under the ... grand slam okay one thousand calories over or under it's more\nI have no idea calories ... like I don't really think about ... I'm Sorry for like ... I don't even know about infringement on their back way right\nI'm going to give you a caloric amount and you just have to try to decide and you got to come to a consensus on this um as as the the authors of branches hell if you think it's over or under the ... grand slam okay one thousand calories over or under it's more\nFor I have no idea calories ... like I don't really think about ...\nI'm Sorry I forgot I feel alone even an infringement on everywhere we write [noise] I'll say\nIs higher than than a grand slam no I'm saying it's way too over Grassley so Rico your opinion is a grand slam as more than a thousand\nCalories right in your opinion is that it has less than a thousand calories are okay I Will say that Rico is a hundred percent right and Brenda you're a hundred percent Ron yeah it is one thousand one hundred and eight calories fifty three point five grams of fat life\nHow about the jumbo Rudy Judy freshman fruity from I hop over or under Thirteen hundred calories\nRudy
