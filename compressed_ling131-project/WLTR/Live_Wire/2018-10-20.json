George Saunders his latest book is Lincoln in the bar do this book is about Abraham Lincoln's son willy who passes away and he's in the bar do which is a sort of a limbo I guess of sorts\nAnd a ... you said you had the idea for many years ago but then you started working on in earnest for about four years or so when did you realize you really had something you know there's in the book one of the things I did was I I uh quoted from historical sources verbatim plagiarized in Memphis is that it was an amazing part of the books\nYou know there's in the book one of the things I did was I I ah quoted from historical sources verbatim plagiarize and all of that was an amazing part of the book yeah\nAnd so there was just an afternoon where I I had tightened up all these historical sources cut them up with scissors was on the floor arranging it kind of feel like I'm just avoiding writing this is this is an elaborate we're doing a collage that's right yeah and then at one point it described his party that the Lincoln's head and\nIt was kind of this party that sent the sun and to the death spiral 'cause it's very loud party in the White House\nSo um I was renting these bits and suddenly\nThis magical thing happened every writer crazed which is it stopped being writing and it started being event\nIt just it just felt wow that party has happened in front of my eyes so it's kind of the realization that even that weird thing that had nothing to do with me typing new tax was part of my uh attempt to emotionally moved to the the audience and then I thought oh this is really weird and actually it's there's a great feeling like you're being a little naughty\nOr someone's going to really hate the you know and and that's actually the feeling you want\nBecause if you can convert that person who says passes punch this fake news you know or whatever is that\nIf you can blow away we're trying to create a safe space for these people\nSick I got [noise] but if you forty five minute timeout on those terms\nIf you can convert the skeptic then then you're really an intimate communication with your readers\nUm you obviously had to do a ton of research about about Lincoln as well and about the time um did you find out stuff about Abraham Lincoln that you had not previously no\nYeah I just fell in love with them I mean he's the one thing was that he was actually even though he was known as being ugly he was incredibly attractive to women\nWomen will always know really really drawn to him very kind very tall kind of powerful guy and he he loves his wife so much so one of the ways he self gamed was to deflect his attention from young women he had a whole system of kind of you know turning away from them\nLoves his wife so much so one of the ways he self gamed was to deflect his attention from young women he had a whole system of kind of you know turning away from them in the name of not aggravating Mary you're not making your own happy so I thought that was kinda cool where do you find out something like that has made it up\nNow I Know the guy I Know that sort of ... you are a master of George Saunders but also you know\nThe thing is I I I came to love about him and said here's a guy who's you know a ... he has no he's in the last four years of his life\nMaking incredible progress ... learning new stuff everyday killing tens of thousands of young men with his mistakes you know and if you track those last three years he's somebody who just kept opening up an opening up and I think his I mean this is my interpretation but I think his eagle just really shrunk\nAnd he became so involved in trying to bring benefit for everybody else that I I mean Buddhism I Would say ... and if somebody who's a initially very large ego\nIn in the face of this pain kind of shrunk and a sort of watch them at the end having\nRealizations about race that we're still not quite you know we still haven't really internalize was kind of really moving you know what'd you say that stands in contrast to the current president [noise] when you when you go on a wicked PTO under a softball question that's going to pop up\nWell I actually I\nI Do want to talk a little bit about that world with you because you wrote a piece back in June of twenty sixteen or at least that was one was published in the New Yorker a windy presidential campaign was still in full swing and\nI still think it was probably for me maybe one of the more eliminating things about the the sort of rise of Donald Trump you went on the campaign trail and just talk to people at his various rallies um did that then to make you\nSurprised than the rest of us when he actually won or were you a shock to know I we weren't really shocked I I went before he was nominated and it'll army because mainly because of the extent to which I couldn't communicate with\nRest of us when he actually won or were you a shock to know I we weren't really shocked I I went before he was nominated and it'll alarming because mainly because of the extent to which I couldn't communicate with his supporters nice people we had a good time it was like a like a Jimmy Buffett concert helped music you know it's just [noise] but then\n[noise]\nBut when you got right down to it that we we liked each other but we didn't persuade each other so I've I've come to think that when you look at Lincoln\n... you you really learn what we all know which is to be a human being as you get older the goal is to get more loving\nLess sure of yourself more comfortable of ambiguity more generous you know Lincoln did the current administration it seems locked in this kind of incompetent mode of fearful and this and just trust and that's really weird is really not what we're about as a country except\nSome thirty eight percent think it is so alarming you know and as an artist so I think if you step towards everything with sympathy as your first move you actually get more information\nYou know and then when you get more information you're actually a better adversary if you have to be one so I I think is actually a time when people who are open minded in large hard it can do both things resist furiously and a love uncontrollably and that's actually where we're going to get out of this mess [noise]\n\nOh well now it's time for me to turn the audience against you\nWere talking to George Saunders now you you got your graduate degree in and literature when you were I think around thirty but before that you actually graduated from the\nColorado School of mines and worked in oil exploration I did yeah guy [noise]\nWhen did you when it's mine's Muslims [noise] they have got to get a bigger scientists that is so confusing and the fact that the two schools are next to each other\nOh they have\nGot to get a bigger scientists that is so confusing in the fact that the two schools are next to each other as very\nWhen when did you sort of realized that you are not you know oil exploration was not for you and were you in your heart a sort of writer at that time to just doing something you thought was maybe a a job that you could make a living and\nI I kind of realize that the first week of classes because I'd been a really bad student in Chicago wasn't going to go to college and I had these two teachers Linda Holmes who intervened and actually called the school and got me and so and I love them so much and I when I got there I realized that uh\nI had to not flunk out because if I flunked out of there I was going to go back to the starting line in Chicago in you know ... circle the bowl so even though I could feel I wasn't good at it as you get this is a real turning point you've got to stick it out so I did and then it went to Asia I worked in the oil fields and uh actually it was okay and I was writing a little\nAnd then uh I had a thing right I was trying to do a Hemingway thing so I went swimming in Sumatra river after some drinking and with and with no clothes if I you know that thing that'll sure are uh [noise] but then I was swimming in it there's a an oil pipeline along the river and on the river there like four hundred monkeys\nAnd I'm dog paddling there and I see them jumping into the water you know I'm like how I Wonder if that's okay [noise] wasn't and I got deathly ill for about three years uh gave up the job and came home and started writing\nSo loud [noise] that is expected that story to be going [noise] but it was what I tell my students\nYou know swimming pool the river and you'll know [laughter]\nWell yeah you you you teach\nA and the M. F. a program in Syracuse um and and I I wanted to get your sort of take on on the state of things there are one is there a particular piece of writing advice\nSyracuse um and and I wanted to get your take on on the state of things there are one is there a particular piece of writing advice that you find yourself giving to your students like\nMore than any other piece of advice\nYeah so what I Try to tell them is that there's actually this whole beautiful thing called revision like radical revision that if you're trying to find your voice is your best friend you you aren't necessarily your totality when you just talk you know if if we both stand up for and just talk\nIt there's some indication if we are but when you go back and start trimming that talk and cutting it down to its essence that's another way that you can you can weigh in so to me there there was a great line um I think Robert Frost said this at a public talk some student ask them a complicated question about the sign up and he said young man don't worry work\nThat's pretty good now I tell a story and then was a process expert pulled me aside of the readings that he didn't say that he said he said he said don't worry [laughter]\n[noise] I like it better that way you haven't so yeah yeah do you feel encouraged about the you know next generation of writers\nI mean are they doing things just differently than than than your generation can conceive of because of the way that they've communicated with each other because of age you you feel a little\nBit of that but what what the best thing about my job is every fall and we meet a new group of young people and it just makes you realize that that ... talent is eternal it as an old person you you will get into that mode where if if you're you know if your mind as his finger tends to tighten over time you know\nThe [noise]\nIs that a result of the monkey river that happened to\nHow much of like your act and in your view on life is affected by your child if you grew up near Boston you did grow up with four kids single mom\nI was the youngest of four yeah we had a very um my mom was a very interesting woman we went to we didn't have like cable television we went to the theater and we went to museums and my mother worked at a ballet and everybody had to play an instrument and I was around a lot of art and when we weren't doing art we were sitting in parks watching people\nBecause that's what my mom would do watch people [noise] and when your age you like what [noise]\nBut now I'm older like we would go for mystery rides and you don't have a lot of money you you'll hop in the Chevy that blows purple smoke when the ...
