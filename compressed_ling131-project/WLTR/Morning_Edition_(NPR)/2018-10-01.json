options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are a niche product always have been that's Doug ... a visiting fellow at the conservative heritage\nConservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products of them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage more\nThan eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans the new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining on shore to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double as met\nSome people have something called health insurance [noise] um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs this\nHalf of any medical bill after that the ... met people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules the insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out\nThe government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for

comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten

that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most is not just on a fever you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately for you to the office and making things ...\nInside the most almost lost\nHuh and by that he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control a lot of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties so what does that mean to ... was turned out good as a result of this frustration you're at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the PKK immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated valid counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names

the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes\nSo the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that the Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy\nIs so it's all quite up in the air

similar is going to pay the demographics you are going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now but we're in the coming years that it changes it started to look more like the

USC\nDr Herbert tell us about the idea\nThat led to the survivors fit club program\nIn two thousand Fifteen several of my colleagues at home with Cancer Center participated in a program known as healthy Charleston challenge and this was a wellness program that teaches individuals how to exercise how to eat properly\nAnd strategies for appropriate relationships to food and they were so passionate about it and I thought would it be great if we had a program like that for breast cancer survivors so I approached him UC wellness center about supporting this opportunity and they were very enthusiastic\nThe funding for this program came from a group of women tennis players in Charleston who wanted to support breast cancer survivors and so they have an annual tennis tournament known as rackets to recovery so we were able to collaborate on this ten week wellness program for breast cancer survivors\nAnd I understand this program has been going on now since two thousand and sixteen\nTell us what really goes on in that breast cancer survivors program the group of survivors meets twice a week Mondays Wednesdays for a two hour session and they have a classroom setting where they get instruction on nutritional issues instruction on strategy is\nStay for a two hour session and they have a classroom setting where they get instruction on nutritional issues instruction on strategies for maintaining healthy lifestyle and also a this component of the program acts as a support group they get to share their stories with one another and get to reflect on the challenges that they're dealing in this part of the recovery\nThe second hour of that session they work out with the wellness center trainers who were able to develop an individualized workout program\nAnd that allows individuals who are varying levels of fitness to still participate in the great program and what really is the impact for these breast cancer survivors from a program like this at the beginning we take analytic body composition measurements and then\nCompare those to the same body metric measurements at the close of the program and we've been able to see market improvement in body fat composition\nAnd muscle mass composition and cardiovascular improvements in fitness is losing weight a part of this program for some of the breast cancer survivors\nAbsolutely what we know is that eighty percent of all breast cancers are sensitive to estrogen that circulates in the body and estrogen levels are increased with increased body fat\nSo if we can reduce body fat\nThat can be the direct mechanism by which we improve breast cancer specific survival there are more than a hundred studies that demonstrate that women who are obese at the time of their diagnosis\nHave a higher risk of breast cancer mortality than those who are lean at the time of diagnosis and why is an exercise program or regular exercise especially important\nFor breast cancer survivors so research demonstrates that higher levels of physical activity after breast cancer diagnosis can lower your breast cancer specific and overall mortality and in response to this Evan is the American society of Clinical Oncology made obesity and cancer and one of its core initiatives and ...\nOverall mortality and in response to this evidence the American society of Clinical Oncology made obesity and cancer one of his core initiatives an advocate for weight management in physical activity programs for all cancer survivors", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Columbia", "day": "01"}
