support for such a plan for years but Greg bird will send them to climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat is the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later burns inside of Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder\nMore on that later burden since says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax\nBut you may wonder why there's an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products verbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions turtles and says the carbon tax his group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is
