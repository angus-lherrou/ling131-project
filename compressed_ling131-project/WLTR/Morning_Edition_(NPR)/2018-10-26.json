target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George

who've been sent these packages well the whole phenomenon\nOf the pipe bombs overseas surprises me in a pool as me but um if you were to say that\nSomebody was out to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack and I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important normal politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen Seventy two or well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary and so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that trauma explains a lot about the focus of his finance or in his promise to extend their life\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into financing moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trade and so that by around Nineteen eighty\nHe was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nTell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\nWell I'm In the nineties his specialty was a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England\nCouldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and weren't sources right or the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nThe pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into some chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics and harnessed\nIt began in his native Hungary and then in the east European countries where his finance or had a clear\nPolitical confidence which was to build ... and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but the switch came in two thousand three when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War or once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on democratic get out the vote causes that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans are and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the media and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major is lowering the because of sort of sorrow and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros some peculiar become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to is it just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as shadowy you caught expanding Russian neighbors actually his philanthropy is called the open society Institute He's very open about it he publishes figures are about where the donations go so I think it's hard to escape\nThe suspicion that the critics who say he shot every I'm a natural ring on a long tradition of anti Semitism\nWhere Jewish finance is a portrayed\nAs the ... through manipulate the politicians and so forth I think it's a fairly clear indication of that tradition well why do people in his native hungry thinking Soros\nHe was a hero early on in the

why now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show line up\nAnd that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it and just as white as it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comment\nWill these aren't ah the only examples of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half\nHours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously\nUh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective markup ferment on the air to talk about a ... a criminal justice issues and to talk about the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things\nOver the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed him on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah which he felt was the acceptability\nHe's a colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about uh what she felt was the acceptability of blackface\nNBC's a nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which is\nReally interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened a sheep and discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nNPR's David
