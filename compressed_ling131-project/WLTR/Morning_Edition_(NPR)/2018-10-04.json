remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they are very very they were very tight group lots of solidarity very to time and women some of them I'm wearing caged in political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives

... chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is\nThey're they're very mixed group of children so there was some children who can walk to can stand there is some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age\nBut then there are other children who you know they can't roll over on the fed through achievements they're telling me that that much much

of investigations to follow here um but one question is whether those tax returns whoever actually made public and then what happened this election could see a lot about that Andrea Bernstein is the co host of Trump Inc the pod casting so much Andrea thank you\nSo since President Trump nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court back in July advocacy groups have spent a whole lot of money nearly ten million dollars on these warring TV ads for and against him now the attacks and this and the spending our fiercer than ever Here's NPR's Peter Overby\nTheir sharpest attacks so far

orchestrated political and he said he knew how it was funded millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nIn fact there is money flying every which way and the Kavanaugh's confirmation battle it comes from advocacy groups that can keep their donors secret the thing that can be traced his TV spending and the Brennan Center for justice at New York university law school has been tracking the Kavanaugh TV ads\nThe centers Douglas Keith said both sides are focusing their ads on three Democratic senators who are up for re election next month\nJoe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nAnd a little over four million dollars has been spent running ads and inject those states\nThere's two million dollars more being spent in Maine home of undecided Republican Senator Susan Collins and about half a million in Alaska home of another uncommitted Republican Lisa Murkowski Keith said these are not high cost media markets\nEspecially when you're looking at states like North Dakota and Alaska um this is really an incredible amount of spending\nThe Brennan Center data show that when it comes to TV there are many

execution\nGo to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nI'm In the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people\nFor executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nWill Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done but you know the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floor is it a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there are more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need\nFor health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the air strikes ISIS blowing buildings out and you'll see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nThere are Syrian

the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Rocca searches bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line would that Steve\nIf you don't provide people with their basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq or in other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around\nSo um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nMatters come visit South Carolina public radio dot org thanks so much\nOrganisms have a

EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm David Greene and we're going to visit rocket now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nUnder the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nWill Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for you know the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available now\nSome electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kinda bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops\nAnd they said there are more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going\nFled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings out and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nFrightened that was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Rocca such as bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with their basic needs for a living resentment will grow people become more deaths\nNot showing up yet and here's the bottom line would that Steve if you don't provide people with their basic needs for living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Columbia", "day": "04"}
