coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity did I hear that you've been taking on line\nShe's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity did I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I'm so tired and I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nAll we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and you know the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity how did that take shape sure it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and\nImmigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but everything that I had been hearing about ice and\nDeported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but everything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I just want to go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not\nEvil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there is a different solution [noise] so I guess it it gave me a lot more\nCompassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but I I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and\n[noise] I understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I ... how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nAn issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we\nBrought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side I think\nThey have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue\nDespite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI has been avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nAlexa grooming thank you so much for talking with us I think you

from the indicator podcast exploring\nMany people in China don't have bank accounts don't really have much of a credit history so China has never created something quite like the American credit score\nAnd so there is the lack of a better way to trust deficit in China that is in that economic activity\nRachel ... teaches trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust she says a lack of trust in people and businesses have held China's economy back so in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them and you know who has lots of data on how people behave\nCompanies especially big companies like Ali Baba that is China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country and has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit so the government has been working with Ali Baba but in the development of people's social credit score\nWay people that

weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say he has to visit rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out took control of the world Jeffrey her for her story of University of Maryland shows the ideology depends on\nGee that Jews are malevolent out took control of the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and\nAre enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to a person holding us I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana now George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nHas written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest me [noise]\nYou know what are they talking about they talk about the leaf you ever see the elite\nSays when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nDanger for the Jew is that we are very small in number but we are prominent\nPeople are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether in Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that his base and if in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy than he is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing

Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they tracked families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model to sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercials spaces CEO

on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional model for long term is and you're replacing it by space which he's getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the puppet render turns into a permanent tenet\nThere is a solution no ducks right now the short term is and your doctor\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more attractive than long term retail leases NPR News I'm Suzie on in Chicago

USC\nDr Patterson tell us some of the top things that can be done to prevent tooth decay during childhood\nSome of the most important things to remember for a parent monitor their child's diet making sure that they have an adequate supply of Florida dated toothpaste and know how to use that toothpaste appropriately for each age of child that they may have at the home\nAnd also to make sure that the child receives regular dental visits for examination that can be anywhere from two to four times a year\nAnd at what age would that first dental visit be recommended for kids the American Academy of pediatric dentistry as well as the American Academy of pediatrics recommends that a child see the dentist before their first birthday or at least by their first birthday\nAnd what about routines for babies and toddlers that might help prevent cavities in those young years\nFor little ones you want to make sure that they're getting their mouth wiped out with just damp washed cloth after feeding ... I'm making sure they're not going to bed with a bottle of anything other than water ensuring that the child is seen by the dentist\nTypically for a young one it's twice a year it can sometimes be bumped\nOther than water ensuring that the child is seen by the dentist\nTypically for a young one it's twice a year it can sometimes be bumped up to three to four times a year depending on that particular child's risk for dental disease\nAnd the children who are getting cavities at a young age what's the cause typically it actually can be multi factorial it can be a combination of the particular germ that the child has in their mouth\nThere are two different effects one called vertical transmission and that's actually because the parent passes they're germ down to the baby who doesn't want to kiss their own baby and so if the mother has untreated dental disease that germ can be passed down to the infant child as well\nDiet plays a critical role anything that stays next to the to structure for prolonged amount of time can cause the germs to kind of build up and feed off of that food debris\nAnd that can lead to tooth decay as well and once kids are in preschool age is rushing three times a day going to do the trick as far as keeping stuff out of the gums and away from the teeth\nAccording to the American Academy of pediatric dentistry the most important thing to prevent tooth decay is twice daily brushing\nFor two minutes with the appropriate amount of Flora dated toothpaste along with their community for dated water and we've talked so far about really young kids what about older kids and teens what are some of the problems that seem to promote dental decay\nHistorically speaking the level of dental disease and our teen population has been on the decline until recently\nMore kids now are getting into sodas and soft drinks that have two things that work against us a lot of sugar but also a lot of acid sports drinks can also have a lot of sugar as well as asset\nAnd so those two things in combination just wreak havoc on their dental condition and so avoiding\nSports drinks can also have a lot of sugar as well as asset\nAnd so those two things in combination just wreak havoc on their dental condition and so avoiding sugary drinks is an important part of good dental health just plain water is going to go a lot further to reduce the level of

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough\nEvidence for forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and\nIt just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side I think\nThey have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump\nI think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and in rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nParty lines and and rather than going out and filling out all of that democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and not coming election [noise] have you talked to your family about your about your evolution\nI has been avoiding it\nYou know prior to

when mass shootings happen in this country we often don't ever understand the motive\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nSay his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey Herve historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person holding us I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest be talking about they talk about the early ...\nTalking about talking about the lead you ever see the elite [noise] than\nYou are the only [noise]\nSays when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that his base and if in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy than he is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years
