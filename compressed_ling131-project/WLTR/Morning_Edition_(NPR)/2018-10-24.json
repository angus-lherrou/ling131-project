that power away\nYeah they'll DNC at a faith based approach to mid term elections they always say that the candidates would win but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense so when you have an environmental historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to demean\nAren't there several states where the ...\nThey're going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the ...\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities and a Colorado and New York Maine two seats\nAre in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding ah what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys one of the draw you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and you had Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing the district lines that's where they came from right well\nWould raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed has to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fun\nWinner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issues that isn't there a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the state wide level I'm using Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district and advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand to end on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand Nineteen\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nIn local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a in a more conservative philosophy\nSeems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic flooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most ... shells member station ... has more [noise]\nRushing into Austin reservoirs has the look of chocolate\nIt's been so turned off by flooding around ... and when it goes Austin's treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter soap on Monday the city told people to conserve\nWater and as a precaution to boil what they were going to use for drinking and food ... [noise] you can probably guess what happened next and I'm calling as I\nFind here yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit\nHow many bottles people could buy it just inconvenient at this point but I start thinking about you know just ... that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are closed cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio simple water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure in its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years this has never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nAs there is is the director of the city's water utility he says after all that silk slowed water treatment\nThe city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure if he loses too much pressure to city won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water and pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings\nWon't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there a says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rains kick up\nMore silt and the river is could last days yeah on that for NPR News I'm most of the show in Austin [noise]\nAnd this is NPR News\nGood morning It's Wednesday October twenty four I'm ...

USAID\nDr homestead tell us about karate\nThe medicine and she's the medical director of telling neuro science at M. USC\nDr homestead tell us about carotid artery disease credit artery disease is when the carotid arteries which are the major blood vessels in the front part of the neck that feed the brain actually become diseased with what we call atherosclerosis or plucking on the insides of the blood vessels\nAnd who's typically at risk for this disease patients that are at risk our patients with vascular risk factors such as diabetes mount us hypertension hyper ... family history of vascular disease obesity\nAnd smoking is highly associated with the development of vascular disease and are there are symptoms or early warning signs of carotid artery disease that's a great question because not all carotid artery disease is the same so what we do is we break it down into symptomatic carotid artery disease and\nA symptomatic carotid artery disease and what that means that symptomatic carotid artery disease is when the blood vessel has become so disease that it can actually cause a stroke or a transient ischemic attack\nSymptoms for that could be things that we think of with a stroke such as weakness on one side of the body difficulty speaking numbness visual changes and facial dripping\nA symptomatic carotid artery disease is disease of the carotid arteries that has not caused the problem is they're screening recommended for carotid artery disease currently there's no Medical Association\nThat his recommending broad screening for carotid artery disease in patients that have not had a stroke like symptoms what can be done to prevent carotid artery disease in an individual this is the best question you could ask because prevention is really keen vascular disease\nSo things that folks should do is work with their primary care physicians to modify the risk factors for vascular disease which would include getting blood pressure tax and getting their blood pressure within goal getting cholesterol checked and\nCare physicians to modify their risk factors for vascular disease which would include getting blood pressure tax and getting their blood pressure within goal getting cholesterol checked and getting that LDL lip it in a very very low range\nQuit smoking so people that are smoking ad are very high risk for vascular disease not just in the crowds but in any vascular bed and their body and so quitting smoking is key to preventing the disease\nAdditionally we would recommend and only under the supervision of your primary care doc but to consider an exercise program and to be active to reduce your risk of obesity hypertension diabetes and cholesterol tell us about this study that you're involved in that is related to carotid artery disease\nSo currently the national Institute of neurological disorders and stroke\nIs funding a clinical trial ... too I mean yes he is just one of many sites in North America that is rolling patients in the study\nAnd basically what that is is looking at patients with chronic disease that has never given them a problem into best medical therapy that we know in two thousand Eighteen versus best medical therapy plus either surgical repair or sending repair you know best medical therapy includes\nHigh dose on medications to reduce the risk of that building up and that includes an anti platelet agents such as an aspirin\nAnd also clues lifestyle modification\nAnd then following those patients over three to five years to see what their outcomes are and the idea is in three to five years there'll be much more information known about which of these approaches seemed to help that's exactly it to really help us determine patients that have carotid artery disease a symptomatic in particular\n[noise]\nThis is Walter ... from history to culture Walter ... good struggled takes you on a journey that delves

Underwood [laughter]\nCoughing and sneezing can help spread the flu but modern medicine can usually overcome it pretty quickly right well that was not the case a century ago in Nineteen Eighteen a historic flu epidemic claimed more than half a million American lives and an estimated fifty million worldwide\nLooking back on the centennial of his public health disaster USC Dr Eric Brenner described at the beginning\nIt was first recognized in us in the spring of Nineteen Eighteen I think his military base in Kansas things quiet down but then the big wave should then\nIn the fall Nineteen Eighteen that was the time of room for one and many soldiers were being transported across the Atlantic ocean this meeting facilitated the spin virus to Europe\nAccording to historian Fritz ... once the virus got started it struck its victims quickly\nIn the morning they would be healthy by evening they would be definitely sick symptoms included extreme headaches some people said it was so painful\nIn the morning they would be healthy by evening they would be definitely sick\nSymptoms included extreme headaches some people said it was so painful it felt like somebody was hitting the head with a baseball bat respiration was very heavy nose bleeds ear bleeds often you would see the extremities like the fingers and the lips bluish because of lack of oxygen\nThe worst of the outbreak was between September in November ... said the flu was first founded in South Carolina in ... county because the virus spread quickly through large crowds ... said camp Jackson near Columbia quickly followed here at\nCamp Jackson you had a camp with somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty thousand troops under training and something like six thousand of those were flipped it by the time it had dissipated in December somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred and forty eight had died\nIn a similar number in Colombia and I've seen an estimate ... burn they say over five hundred\nDied state wide the flu killed at least six thousand people there was little treatment then said Brett are so an effort was made to keep people from congregating concerts movies and even church services were canceled\nYou should get into a complex situation where thousands of people sick at the same time then certain kinds of social distancing measures might be recommended such as canceling mass events perhaps movie theaters or concerts should stay closed for a while\nBut anyway social distancing and good hygiene and staying home if you're sick can all be helpful\nHammer noted an odd reaction to the crisis from the White House Woodrow Wilson\nRefused to recognize this as a huge issue for the nation his focus was that we had to win this war and so the fourth liberty loan drive that was scheduled for October of ...\nWas that we had to win this war and so forth liberty loan drive that was scheduled for October of Nineteen Eighteen continued despite the fact that communities we're trying to end these public gatherings\nBrenner said because flu virus was discovered until Nineteen thirty three and a vaccine not widespread until Nineteen forty five the pandemic was not beaten by doctors it just ran its course\nBecause as time goes on people who've had the disease either die for you become immune because your body is made antibodies against the virus is covered so if enough people have died in that people have had the flu and recovered vendor not many susceptible people left\nBoth men said even with modern medicines an epidemic of some sort could indeed happened again and cited recent outbreaks of flu Andy Bola in parts of the world Amer set a silver lining to the Nineteen Eighteen epidemic was that public health departments in South Carolina and throughout the nation were strengthened and their finances bolstered\nThe last thing to socialism saying man\nOn day one of my daughter's healthy appreciation for the second amendment and\nThe far left to socialism saying oh

you always afraid of the cat is would win but we didn't do much else democratic\nChairman Tom ... is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning for years Republicans have

state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican who oversees his party's efforts\nDepart farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense um when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that are aggression tend to mean\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding what you're saying is the narrow margins by which no seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes\nSo it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tie between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys want the dry you got the drawing even though you lost a lot of ground the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic\nThe lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right well\nI Would raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representatives that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system women districts uh and so applying a notion that a statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the state wide level I'm using Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of [noise]\nTheir district and advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nYou had a wave election in two thousand to end that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand Eighteen well\nCertainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nPrize in local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a a a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most was shelled member station K. U. T. has more\nRushing into Austin reservoirs has the look of chocolate\nIt's been so turned off by flooding around silky even when it goes Austin's treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter soap on Monday the city told people to conserve\nWater and as a precaution to boil what they were going to use for drinking in food ... you can probably guess what happened next non ... as I\nDo find here yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit how many\nBottles people could buy it just inconvenient at this point but I start thinking about you know just daily things that we use water I hadn't even thought about what kinds of things some restaurants\nThose people could buy it just inconvenient at this point but I start thinking about you know just ... that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are closed cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio central water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure in its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years this has never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nBritain as there is is the director of the city's water utility he says after all that silk slowed water treatment\nThe city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure if he loses too much pressure that said he won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rains kick up\nMore silt and the river is could last days beyond that for NPR News I'm mostly shell in Austin [noise]\nAnd this is NPR News\nGood morning It's Wednesday October twenty four I'm ...
