anxieties that shaped election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted\nBack on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's her conversation with richer more\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me\nI first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he would hug me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know I'll let you know as I was reading in bed you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period\nAnd through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account um while you're while taking his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks of that or\nA state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore\nSo he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right yes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had ... for short period of time\nAnd he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people and\nAfter I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nWe're almost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody it was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told mark that and he cried and I think maybe that planted the seeds because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now\nIt's it's it's a process [noise]\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how
