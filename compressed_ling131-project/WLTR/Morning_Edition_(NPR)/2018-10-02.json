It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the FBI is broadening its investigation into Brett Kavanaugh this week and with the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us\nTo get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how differently the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his\nOwn behalf of his number one in the class I don't know I thought well no no no no no go zone for 'em or I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about\nClass I don't know I thought oh no no no no going out there so I'm going to borrow more I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record our city you're mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still\nCome off as credible he had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her trace there's\nBeen exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the intra ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious and it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark\nJust missed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of\nMen's anger being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well impart\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's\nAlmost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been\nThe women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color whose stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is a character assassination by the left so as women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda not at all that is very often politically potent and ...\nOnly a productive for the if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda not at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around calving off is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRitual spoke there with Rebecca Traister the author of the book good in math

economy\nIf the rules of the game are not being adhered to and enforced it creates uncertainty and that affects investment decisions sourcing decisions\nAnd businesses could become more cautious about investing a new projects which could hurt jobs and growth the U.

completely ignore it and that's what the Trump Administration is doing today\nMarcello Hillary August is a professor of international economics of the University of Geneva he says Trump would rather

charges your insurer which passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs\nAnd he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman or talking about sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty four teen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families and that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Marilyn Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money and so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see\nEach hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets\nPaid well and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hard ball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because of the health care industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are at five times and Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape I\nWonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital there would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs\nMaryland would say absolutely yes her message really to employers is you need to push back you need to read the fine print and your contracts you need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high and get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to the smaller

of women's anger\nMoment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's

full of examples of\nMen's anger being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the

impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color\nWho have been the leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies\nThat gets lost is that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement or ups\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years\nAlthough we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women thing are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nThis is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd that kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of

another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive

French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a tripped pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development at the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey started got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nWe're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal is it to see Strickland to see\nThey did something called a tripped pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development at the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal is it to see Strickland to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics\nWell this is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so down a strict them was asked about this in the press conference and even she seem a bit surprised by that\nFact you are the second woman ever getting that no prize in physics let's get comments on that\nI thought okay I might have been more but I think\nIt is true yeah there's only been to others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen oh three and there have been many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked\nDoes surprise does this suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nI'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant in the hard science is especially ah Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their own prices\nThis year one of those prices went to a woman named Jocelyn bell burnout who had herself and overlooked for a Nobel Prize that prize was for three million dollars the Nobel or just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that and\nThat's really interesting okay there is a third Nobel Prize winner\nIt's a an advancement for women physicists I'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant that into hard sciences especially ah Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their own prices\nThis year one of those prices went to a woman named Jocelyn bell burnout who had herself and overlooked for a Nobel Prize that prize was for three million dollars the Nobel search just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that and\nThat's really interesting okay there's a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe can is his name Bell Labs and New Jersey the place where he did a much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nThey are actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which is light tumbled physical things objects wow and that actually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nIf you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're ... ... individual atoms even while and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWell the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also in physics it's used pretty widely [noise]", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "02"}
