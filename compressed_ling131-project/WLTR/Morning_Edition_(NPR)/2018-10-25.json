conference with President Roosevelt was\nThat was the first time the Saudi monarch had left his home country now Seventy three years later the relationship between the U.S and Saudi Arabia is

put your questions to commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your inquiries each week about how politics and government work either Cokie high fever certainly a big question now this relationship works and here's our first question\nThis is Nicole ... from Nashville, Tennessee in the U.S Saudi Arabia special relationship really based primarily on an oil arms arrangement or is there something more to it\nWas not oil for arms into oil and arms\nOf recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices\nBut it's also purchasers President Trump has repeatedly said of arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states is saying Saudi Arabia's a check on Iran both in the region internationally\nAnd to the extent that it's alive issues us also thinks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful and then the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace\nAbout oil is also on the minds of our next listener\nSo thanks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful in in the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nNow oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Shawn fits Morris I'm from New Orleans Louisiana out of the U.S view Saudi Arabia before oil was a thing thank you\nBasically there was no view before oil was a thing a Saudi Arabia as we know it was became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year and signed an agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be the leader for a unified the country and started a relationship with the U.S\nWas Abdulazeez evens out he had forty five sons Steve and all the king's since his death in Nineteen fifty three of them one of those sons the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nI was just out of the south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence as the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert a the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off\nAccess to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided with the Saudis that they're ... and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia in some way because of the journalist killing us well Cokie thanks as

S. much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't\nA great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency [noise]\nIt's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to be depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trend\nShould get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out text\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he can help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nLand use agriculture ... oils frustration\nOur ... chain coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about plunging so what is\nA long chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology\nThe spread awareness about ...

credit systems the total number of carbon possible to MIT is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate

disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be released\nCan bally's big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it's just there's a quick and easy solution\nThat things that fix climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute because it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be
