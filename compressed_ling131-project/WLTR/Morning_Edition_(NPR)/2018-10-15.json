Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is\nIt's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's out of versus them President Trump it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing complicity and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable to uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this well he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is him or\nOr the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nSame breath he said I feel very comfortable to uh was was encouraging as comfortable swimming in this well he\nWas I mean in a lot of ways he created the swamp set the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich likes most about Trump when you try to get them to talk about Trump is andme or\nOr the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nDamien says al Damian thank you so much thank you so much for having me [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\nMORNING EDITION using him here on South Carolina public radio this morning at Penn gets on points from the economy and health care holiday and the environment on point toss newsmakers and listeners about the issues that matter most\nI notice that change joined me for breaking news compelling analysis with commentaries in interviews on all things considered later this afternoon at for here in South Carolina Public radio state and\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION here on South Carolina public radio joined me ... results [noise] marketplace this evening at six thirty [noise]\nPublic radio this morning at Penn it's on points from the economy and health care to politics and the environment on point talks with newsmakers and listeners about the issues that matter most\nI Know the chain joined me for breaking news compelling analysis with commentaries in interviews on all things considered later this afternoon for here in South Carolina Public radio stay tuned\nThere listening to MORNING EDITION here on South Carolina public radio joined me ... result but marketplace this evening at six thirty [noise]\nHere in South Carolina Public radio W S C I F ...

Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nNo coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky\nFair Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources of the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't shelf\nThem I'm social filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're probably global sales have been out facing\nYour domestic sales well and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements that they will ... agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat\nWill very concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hope\nJust to just to be clear on that fact that you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen or Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what was the key free trade agreements today well a nasty and the EU agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements has become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nUh we don't like any options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tests are taxes no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs you consumer and hopefully you know have people that have converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as a state that voted for president for that has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh uh come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind

haven't heard much\nUh uh come up as an issue yet do you mean an issue like at election yeah it has come up I mean\nCongress and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows where everything's Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah\nIn and he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks it I guess that's the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced they could move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in America if you want to sell you better making jak\nBeginning a next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from a price standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for a generation\nEric Gregory Kentucky distillers association\nWe turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane Michael Chet Florida's panhandle last week [noise]\nLong term consequence is one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or they'd be converted a blast for years sadly if they start looking in one\nBourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations beret\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable road than non functional phones and made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster\nBought a just a forty mile cross\n... works in the fried division of tower hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor a situation like that and that aside I got it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas have lost a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and caught industry is devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster with alpha insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nCaught was ready to be picked last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just blows it away\nLast April source of income as her livelihood\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars in damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses and yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do\nScott industry is just devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster without insurance in Alabama he's been working in Houston county\n... debate it last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just blows it away\nLast April source of income as her livelihood\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler and Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your finger and like everything\n... obviously that's not going to happen or even when you're you're talking to people that house was destroyed all their belongings showed pictures no amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your parents that are passed away to your child first birthday\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirmed judges take another whacking Obamacare help President Trump shut down the Miller investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be in perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a\nSimple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across the floor that will greatly affect the ruins of for some who had been at it for a long time and ... and

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and ... there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts in opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval\nBig in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he casts them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election is we're dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overall goal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding the wall replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder\nMara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News my name is Monica Monica is a longtime public radio listener\nI think I started listening to NPR and all of them like ... where a guy last night we always have it honored everyday when I came home from school\nWe called her up to find out what you love so much about public radio\nI just really love hearing that tape tune into kind of started her head for the chance had to learn\nYou're listening to NPR News my name is on a catalyst or gym on a ... a longtime public radio listener\nI think I started listening to NPR and all of them like rents were avid NPR listener we always have it on and you know every day when I came home from school\nWe called her up to find out what you love so much about public radio\nI just really love hearing the tape human interest kind of started her head for the chance to learn about what's going on in the world but also what reasons for why things are going on too\nBut here's the thing about Hanukkah she's more than just a listener she gives to the public radio stations you love so much we wanted to know why\nEverytime I guess that makes me allowed to get around to doing it but once I Do I feel like I Am ...

a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest horses at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum shelf\nThem I'm shell filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably your global sales have been now facing\nYour domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger to sailors more than half their market maybe over\n... if I'm distorted a sealer but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global market has really increased ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nasty and the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know you have distilleries are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like\nWe you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that looked like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nWe'll ah we don't like the ... on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tests were taxes no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid in the obvious as a state that voted for president for that has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nOr [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh uh come up as an issue yet\nYou mean an issue like an election yeah it has to come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us\nIn the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how did the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what Barbie means you can Jackie a heat will note for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah\nIn in he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called Burman thinks the Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike you know highly David sandwich announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here\nPlaying bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which now so you can move some production overseas we can't do that with ... you got to make it here in American if you want to sell you better make the\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequence is one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking in price standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations\nSpirit

mostly sunny upper seventies\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress up President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be in perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power\nTo again sets the agenda and get bills across the floor that will greatly affect the ruin of for some who had been at it for a long time and ... and one of them maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be\nPublications will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts in opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's in eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we're dedicated electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding goal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the\nAnd as we are dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd

U. S. C. children's health and she is a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\n... what are the recommendations for children and teens as far as getting the flu vaccine\nIn terms of their recommendation we recommend that all people six months of age and older get a flu vaccine annually for little ones for their first season often get to vaccines a month apart but everyone else is just the one vaccine each year\nAnd what about the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for children in particular\nIn terms of the flu vaccines advocacy we know that children who get vaccinated are less likely to get the flu and if they do get the flu than they are less likely to get complications from the flu or be hospitalized because of the flu we also know that the flu shot is more effective than the nasal spray vaccine\nAnd we know that there is also the concept of herd immunity in other words the more people that get vaccinated that protects a greater number of people but they\nAnd we know that there is also the concept of herd immunity in other words the more people that get vaccinated that protects a greater number of people but the efficacy of the flu vaccine\nIs pretty high and the reason for that is that scientists actually talked to predict the following years vaccine and what strains are going to be circulating in order to make the right vaccine for the following year\nAnd document when is the best time of the year or the season to get vaccinated that time is now Bobby so right here at the beginning of October\nThat's when the flu vaccines are out and now is a good time because that way you'll be protected through the end of the flu season and sometimes that season extends through April or may\nOr even sometimes into June if kids get the flu what is the best way to take care of that child certainly hydration is really important to watch so if it's a young child are they still having the same number ... diapers are they taking a good amount of liquids orally at least acetaminophen ibuprofen if that's age appropriate for the child\nJust general sort of symptomatic comfort keeping them away from other people so that they're not spreading the flu\nWashing your hands like crazy so that you're not spreading it through your household or to other people\nAnd then people often ask about the anti viral medications and I would just say that those are not without side effects some of which are quite significant and they are quite expensive and often we run out of them each flu season so certainly the anti virals are not a substitute for the flu vaccine and\nThat's something that should be discussed with the child's physicians and if a child gets the flu are there any symptoms that you can mention\nThat might indicate it's time to seek medical care for that child the most common complication of the flu would be some type of respiratory complications such as pneumonia so if the child is having trouble breathing breathing quite fast if you can see their belly", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "15"}
