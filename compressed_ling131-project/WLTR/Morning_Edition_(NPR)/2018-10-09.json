China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob thanks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money as that happens\nSome public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff jet standard likes that system he's in Lewiston in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on so there are steps are going to be half of what we're taking

finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the radio of course it just blew 'em up because of er watching everybody to get up and go in front of the screen is either yes or no or you know you couldn't Sunni to\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nA shortage play to the judge what happened and they told me to record\nSoon after David than was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison [noise]\nLawyer Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the

as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am\nThe least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my clients and shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase stale amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a tradeoff that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR News I'm Lee gains in Urbana, Illinois [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\nMorning It's Tuesday October nighttime George Kearns with a
