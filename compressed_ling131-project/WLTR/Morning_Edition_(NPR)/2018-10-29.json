Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nI didn't have any needles stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical

doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area even if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient is being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano oh and on this last visit I saw him on a grand embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to

King\nWas a lovely image at the end of this\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nA lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it\nThis is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary\nSo if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the experts\nAnd the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much thanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health

Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy\nBecause they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil or almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they use for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers\nThe last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride and I think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively\nI should say though that most NATO himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo the judge had to remind him and and people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to

a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the

U. S. C.\nDr Hanson when a national tragedy or violent event happens what can parents do to help their teen cope with this event\nTeens just like younger children are going to need to feel like they're safe they're also going to have a lot of questions and they're going to want answers and explanations to have a better understanding of what happened\nThe biggest challenge we face with teens is that they tend to look to their peers for answers to their questions rather than seeking out caregivers and other adults\nSo what can a parent do than to make a difference\nCaregivers can let their child and know that they're there for them and look for opportunities to have open conversations so for example at dinner time checking in with their teen and asking them what did you hear about what happened today what did you hear from your friends when did you hear from other people at school from teachers\nThat provides an opportunity to have a conversation about the experience and to correct any misinformation the team may have\nAnd what other extra help can you think of that teens might need having\nA conversation about healthy ways to cope after a tragedy is really important letting teens know that sometimes when bad things happen people may turn to alcohol or drugs but that's not helpful\nAnd reminding them of more helpful an objective ways to cope after a traumatic event things like talking journal ing seeking out conversations with friends or with other trusted adult letting teens know that those are more adaptive ways to cope can be really helpful to reduce the risk\nConversations with friends or with other trusted adult letting teens know that those are more adaptive ways to cope can be really helpful to reduce the risk for long term problems\nAnd what about teens who seem extra anxious or fearful even as time has gone by\nIts problems persist two to three months after the incident it's helpful for the teen and the parent to seek out professional help perhaps talking with a trusted doctor or a mental health professional or school guidance counselor what\nElse can parents do to sort of keep their eyes and ears open and help their teenager\nOne thing I Would suggest is that parents have a conversation with their teens about social media and about watching TV and watching the news and the Internet because we know that for teens particularly those who have been especially affected by what happened very anxious very fearful\nGreater media exposure can increase fear the parents need to do is to let Thirteen now you might want to consider limiting your time on social media because we know that that can make you feel more afraid\nAnd don't your Hansen what other ways might some teens respond when a national tragedy occurs\nSo for teens who do want to take on an advocacy role caregivers still playing an important role first they should have a conversation with Thirteen about why they want to take on that kind of role second they need to be supportive and Sarah they should have a discussion with their teen about parameters for taking on a kind of role\nI'm Lisa Mullen's aloha may be the only Hawaiian word most Americans know but

more I was part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary\nSo if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you

of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and lived here no\nIn yesterday's runoff election he'll take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil or almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both now defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively\nI should say though that both NATO himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects to the judge had\nTo remind him and and people that people will reveal about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's so central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in Rio\nHe's rainy on as going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe this I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force than they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ...\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a ... or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks You're welcome\nNow we are more about social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue

us to do with those like that\nYou want us to just censor anybody that phrase ongoing in that what you're proposing huh well I run into problems and here's the thing he answered the bad speech or hate speech however you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the man accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats he says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWinter thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone who killed Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who made a now for Donald Trump or they allow hate to be viewed at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nThink the line as we are free speech become a threat Kelly McBride is it\nFree speech and inciting violence\nI think the line is where free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says ... is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says\nLast year Google band gaps up apple rejected it and Microsoft terminated its agreement with that last month just in the last twenty four hours at least two Web hosting platforms have

U. S. C.\nDr Hanson when a national tragedy or violent event happens what can parents do to help their teen cope with this event\nTeens just like younger children are going to need to feel like they're safe they're also going to have a lot of questions and they're going to want answers and explanations to have a better understanding of what happened\nThe biggest challenge we face with teens is that they tend to look to their peers for answers to their questions rather than seeking out caregivers and other adults\nSo what can a parent do than to make a difference\nCaregivers can let their child and know that they're there for them and look for opportunities to have open conversations so for example at dinner time checking in with their teen and asking them what did you hear about what happened today what did you hear from your friends when did you hear from other people at school from teachers\nThat provides an opportunity to have a conversation about the experience and to correct in\nYou hear from other people at school from teachers that provides an opportunity to have a conversation about the experience and to correct any misinformation the team may have\nAnd what other extra help can you think of that teens might need\nHaving a conversation about healthy ways to cope after a tragedy is really important letting teens know that sometimes when bad things happen people may turn to alcohol or drugs but that's not helpful\nAnd reminding them of more helpful an objective ways to cope after a traumatic event things like talking journal ing seeking out conversations with friends or with other trusted adult letting teens know that those are more adaptive ways to cope can be really helpful to reduce the risk for long term problems\nAnd what about teens who seem extra anxious or fearful even as time has gone by\nIts problems persist two to three months after the incident it's helpful for the teen and the parents to seek out professional help perhaps talking with a trusted doctor or a mental health professional or school guidance counselor what\nElse can parents do to sort of keep their eyes and ears open and help their teenager\nOne thing I Would suggest is that parents have a conversation with their teens about social media and about watching TV and watching the news and the Internet\nBecause we know that for teens particularly those who have been especially affected by what happened very anxious very fearful greater media exposure can increase fear but what parents need to do is to let Thirteen now you might want to consider limiting your time on social media\nBecause we know that that can make you feel more afraid\nAnd don't your hands and what other ways might some teens respond when a national tragedy occurs\nSo for teens who do want to take on an advocacy role caregiver still\nSome teams respond when a national tragedy occurs\nSo for teens you do want to take on an advocacy role caregivers still playing an important role first they should have a conversation with their teen about why they want to take on that kind of role second they need to be supportive and Sarah they should have that discussion with their teen about parameters for taking on that kind of role", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Columbia", "day": "29"}
