emergency physician at M. usa children's hospital Dr King tell us briefly about common causes of accidental poisoning and children\nSo the good news about these poisonings is that the vast majority are minimally toxic we're talking about things around the house like cosmetics deodorant soaps and lotions and things like that are more dangerous exposures include things like medicines vitamins cleaners and things you may find in your garage\nAnd do most of these the accidental poisonings involved toddlers and preschoolers and they're really young children in the family\nThat's definitely true among all poisonings in the United states children and adults\nOver half of them a current children lesson age six and if you look at that age group there's a real spike and exposures around age one or two and that's because children have become mobile at that time they're crawling around the floor picking things up putting things in their mouth a special little pills and things that might look like candy to them\nWhat can parents and caregivers do to prevent these accidental poisonings\nThe majority of exposures occur in the home over Ninety five percent and so that's really the place to start and I tell parents really the things to focus on our storage and thinking like a child\nAnd so making sure you have your medicines safely store it in the same spot you know where they are making sure they're in child proof containers for example when kids go to the grandparents' house that's a source of potential problems because\nThe grandparents may not be used to having kids at home and maybe use to leaving their medicines out so that can be a big issue in fact there are several different types of medicines that can be quite dangerous for a child in small doses things like blood pressure medicines medicines to control blood sugar iron pills and anti depressants\nWe've talked about prescription medicines what about other things that kids common like get into that\nIron pills and anti depressants\nWe've talked about prescription medicines what about other things that kids common like get into that can really cause some trouble\nOver the counter medicines can be quite dangerous for children things like a typhoon hydro Maine which has been a drill\nTylenol which is a seat of men if and those can be quite dangerous to a child and in an overdose and so a lot of cough and cold preparations to may have a flavor that's you know tempting for a child and if a child drinks a whole bottle of a cough and cold medicine they can cause real problems in a kid or as an adult it would be less of an issue\nIn addition to medicines what are some of the other categories that really can cause some potential problems\nWe've had some issues lately with the church in pods kids getting into those because they sort of have the look of candy they have really concentrated soaps and then they can cause quite a burned to the esophagus when children swallow them another issue we see a lot are concerns about button battery ingestion and so those are those small circular batteries that are in many toys\nIf could swallow these and they get stuck in the U.S off because they can actually burn through and cause serious injury\nAnd don't you can't if you suspect that your child has ingested some thing that could be poisonous what to do right on the spot\nSure now as long as there is not an emergency going on the first call I Would make is to poison control there are a great resource and they can walk you through what to do at home and in fact\nOver eighty five percent of the time they are going to be able to prevent you from meeting go into the hospital and to be honest that's often our first call when kids come to the emergency department as we call the poison control as well to get their advice on how to handle it poison control a such a great resource that I Would really recommend that every parent have that number available to call a case of an emergency\nHi I'm Jeff Hoffman part of a team of meteorologist now helping South Carolina public radio with weather coverage throughout the Palmetto State\nWhen weather becomes an emergency will be on

C. children's hospital\nDon't you can't tell us briefly about common causes of accidental poisoning and children\nSo the good news about these poisonings was at the vast majority are minimally toxic we're talking about things around the house like cosmetics deodorant soaps and lotions and things like that are more dangerous exposures include things like medicines vitamins cleaners and things you may find in your garage\nAnd do most of these the accidental poisonings involved toddlers in preschoolers\nFamily that's definitely true among all poisonings in the United states children and adults\nOver half of them a current children lesson age six and if you look at that age group there's a real spike and exposures around age one or two and that's because children have become mobile at that time they're crawling around the floor picking things up putting things in their mouth a special little pills and things that might look like candy to them what\nParents and caregivers do to prevent these accidental poisonings\nThe majority of exposures occur in the home over Ninety five percent and so that's really the place to start and I tell parents really the things to focus on our storage and thinking like a child\nAnd so making sure you have your medicines safely store it in the same spot you know where they are making sure they're in child proof containers for example when kids go to the grandparents' house that's a source of potential problems because\nThe grandparents may not be used to having kids at home and maybe used to leaving her medicines out so that can be a big issue in fact there are several different types of medicines that can be quite dangerous for a child in small doses things like blood pressure medicines medicines to control blood sugar iron pills and anti depressants\nWe've talked about prescription medicines what about other things that kids common like get into that kind of really cause some trouble\nOver the counter medicines can be quite dangerous for children things like a typhoon hydro Maine which has been a drill\nTylenol which is a seat of men if and those can be quite dangerous to a child and in an overdose and so a lot of cough and cold preparations to may have a flavor that's you know tempting for a child and if a child drinks a whole bottle of a cough and cold medicine they can cause real problems and a kid or as an adult it would be less of an issue\nIn addition to medicines what are some of the other categories that really can cause some potential problems\nWe've had some issues lately with the charging pods kids getting into those because they sort of have the look of candy they have really concentrated soaps and him and they can cause quite a burned to the assault\nHad some issues lately with the charging pods kids getting into those because they sort of have the look of candy they have really concentrated so to them and they can cause quite a burned to the esophagus when children swallow them another issue we see a lot are concerns about button battery ingestion and so those are those small circular batteries that are in many toys\nIf kids swallow these and they get stuck in the U.S off as they can actually burn through and cause serious injury\nAnd don't you can if you suspect that your child has ingested some thing that could be poisonous what to do right on the spot\nSure now as long as there's not an emergency going on the first call I Would make is to poison control there are a great resource and they can walk you through what to do at home and in fact\nOver eighty five percent of the time they're going to be able to prevent you from meeting go into the hospital and to be honest that's often our first call when kids come to the emergency department as we call the poison control as well to get their advice on how to handle it poison control is such a great resource that I Would really recommend that every parent to have that number available to call a case of an emergency", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "22"}
