damage this relationship with is one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country\nUm to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um you see what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier are presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkers soil ah I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying there would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President putting in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean

friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a a real problem ah\nFor the Saudis the Saudis overreacted to the Canadians are when the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained\nOr in the Ritz Carlton there were some reports of torture when

box set that really captures the golden age of afro Cuban music it contains five legendary albums featuring some of Cuba's plaintiff musician these recordings were made in Havana pan art studios between Nineteen\nFifty six and Nineteen sixty four that's the period just before communist leader Fidel Castro nationalize the recording industry and since then these albums have become extremely hard to come by\nUntil now that is that is called the complete Cuban jam sessions volumes one through five and here to talk about it is Felix Contreras host of NPR's Latino podcast they feel like Hey David what's happening\n[noise] will I'm enjoying the music there's very little Cuban music he claims that I don't think so but when I first of all the studio\nStudio was the best to young Cubans so that virtually every major Cuban artist had played at some point or another and these sessions or from after hours Jeff Sessions after the musicians played the gigs that places like the hotel and that's you know and really opulent Tropicana nightclubs\nThese are the best musicians gathered together to experiment with that mixture of afro Cuban music and ...\n[noise] so this was like the after our stuff yeah to take off all the and the shirts and the little jackets\nAnd they would just go into the room and just started playing and the owner of the studio ran tape the whole time sometimes between ten PM and fix him\nWhile 'til the sun would come out there you go so what happened exactly when Castro came to power\nEventually he nationalized the recording industry and the bureaucrats

right and the free wheeling bohemian themed suffered a little bit because the government felt there was a reflection of the decade next to the United states\nSo the owners of the studio were concerned about what was going to happen with the masters and what was going to happen to the style of music so they started taking these masters\nAnd smuggling them out of the country and depositing them in different Latin American countries along the way so what happened to those recordings over the years in hiding eventually they were sold at different labels in Latin America over the years some shoddy reproductions were produced along the way but most of the albums became incredibly hard to find\nSo finally a couple of years ago California label craft recordings Baucus Mexican label that was holding on to these tapes and they've figured out what they were holding and he decided to put something like this together [noise]\nSo what are some of the highlights what stands out okay there's one

that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if

popular Saudi journalist to\nBe what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict brought by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia
