diverse\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend have been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the anthem trail we had heard that there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high\nShe invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around with eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [laughter] how trend is the ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter\nShe's been backing Republicans since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me he was certainly no fan of president bronco bomber who he said just wasn't tough enough on the world stage\nWhom a window like him very much\nAnd and then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far sofa\nIn this country who who do good uh what do you like what do you\nYou're unemployed rate low uh-huh and um\nDo what do you like what you're\nYou're unemployed rate the low uh-huh and I'm\nStill smoked it in a group in Greece and so the economy is important to you yeah\nAnd that this is this is um I open\nIt [laughter] I didn't realize how he he thought of Trump but we haven't talked about that so is this the first time yeah and I had a surprise because then I'll have a conversation\nAbout the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how undemocratic Vietnam is the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a president basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people\nWhat your reaction to that\nMenu all I like all go home and yelled out GM neither degrees\nOr from time to read a book about what these things\nWhere they don't care about the food in\nYour ... says yeah CNN again from would fall for both of them\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly a fire and I don't know if he does is\nThe al ... just in law I think it allows apple I'm Trump boxes like ... you know make a phone [laughter]\nDo you think you think the media\nIs too negative about Trump food is not fair\nYou know make a phone [laughter]\nDo you think do you think the media is too negative about Trump that\nHe's not fair to say that Russia interfered in to the left in this country mhm\nBut when they know that\nWhy don't why shouldn't before the election [noise] the way until from both elected and the main issue\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with yeah the Russians where that would that bother you yeah\nBut you don't get your don't believe that yet [laughter]\nThey're doing proven that don't need to believe them you know I don't do that\nBut I don't either FBI then they don't know which I don't know that he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah there's something you agree on yeah\nThere are a lot of families who've been divided over\nTheir views of from what you hear like dinner conversations that yeah the go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this no\nBecause I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one percent and I clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents let Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody\nGot to go to vote yes you would fall toys\nAnd for future either we're going\nTo think everybody should vote

act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal would yell All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five how are the laws changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote and we could have been ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial uh at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood\nBut then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration and as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote\nBy the late Nineteen early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well of course black\nMen but given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment and Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively stripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of light\nMen were given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment and Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively stripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineties amendment in Nineteen twenty\nBut you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is a candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about refusing himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nDo they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy paying their chart and I live in Omaha Nebraska when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nThen I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWhile they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require a current residential streets addressed Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing I see irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned about their residency\nForty
