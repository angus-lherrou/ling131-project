punished for the crimes they committed against using the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a

clear conscience\nThat I advocate for people\nDuring our half hour interview not humor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong she says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes but even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she's sometimes finds herself frustrated\n... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard what that is not my fault because they feel like too much is going on in terms of woman ... victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman's someplace in the world or groups of

Friday on prime video\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King\nMore than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian girls its founder is an American woman named Katie ... she has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital\nStories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her biggest dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly for undercut the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those\nCharities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its founder Katie ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media and about how you present the story level really engage with hearts bubble make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Kate him either why did she start this organization\nKatie my there's a woman from New Jersey who had along background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him either has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nEm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain\nAnd the eighty of West point of where he operated he was well liked and he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my other and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them which he's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd I my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV rain [noise]\nIt was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a ...\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also to court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the peace ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling this story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia is still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community the sense of a lot of people had a feeling that something is wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ...\nSchool donor community I think I'm a local community the sense of a lot of people had a feeling that something going wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on and the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are both her process

the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery\nThey do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as entering virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus which so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response off the arm or lake weakness paralysis and most of these patients\nExtensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response off the arm or like weakness and paralysis and most of

against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you said how to do\nIn your case it twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot left to do what is next for you after winning the prize\nI'm I'm twenty

Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes finds herself frustrated\n... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard what that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of woman being victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual violence or terrorist groups and so I feel like this is not new to people and it's not going to be the last time and people have become numb to this kind

a result Reagan can only open three sites this election\nEarly but he was very popular and gets to county and and I would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having were locations you know helping more voters versus\nAre British eerie responsibilities to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights in a state where a voter id redistricting and early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last\nFew years during in June debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend at the rest also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has them refer and has been

curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ... she has thousands of social media followers they're my lawyer tells stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital\nStories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities\nInto what went wrong with that charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's at more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media and about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts bubble make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did she start this organization\nKicked him out there was a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah of community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started up a charity first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him either has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighties\nIn the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked and he became very highly trusted\nReally very very quickly [noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my either and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him which he's conceded in an interview but that same year in twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think is rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was ...\nAnd after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which\nAccording to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested on one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia is still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and then also the local local donor community I think um and the local community had the sense
