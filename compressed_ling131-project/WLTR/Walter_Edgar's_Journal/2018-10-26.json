Charleston\nWe're going to be talking about a book that Adam has written called outside agitator the civil rights struggle of Cleveland Sellers junior and it's another product of hubs city writers program up in Spartanburg which has been a a wonderful asset for producing local history in South Carolina Adam\nYou have a degree in music\nYeah okay and then you were in the business world yeah where did you do undergraduate work the University of Michigan okay and then you got a journalism degree from Columbia and you ended up in Charleston South Carolina\nCrazy circuitous sort of yes I started off as a musician and um played violin growing up for many years and then switched to voice in high school\nAnd went to the University of Michigan music school to get my undergraduate degree and then went to the Manhattan school of music in New York City to get my graduate degree\nAnd vocal performance and then worked you know it did a little singing did some performing stayed in music and then eventually had to kind of get a real job\nWhich fortunately was music related initially\nAnd that it was also in the technology realm so I went from there into a series of other jobs and ended up sort of in the business world so ten years of my life I was working on aids\nI went from there into a series of other jobs and ended up sort of in the business world so ten years of my life I was working on ATMs and touch screen kiosks and credit cards and financial services and finding myself increasingly uncomfortable\nSo I went back to school I went to Columbia and became a journalist\nWas supposed to encourage your first job [noise]\nYes it was my first full time journalism job\nAnd if you're still there in today's economy particularly in journalism the fact that you're still with the same place she started off\n... is unusual actually because when I first entered journalism it was of a a very dynamic world you know a lot of reporters moved from place to place a after a few years and\nUm and it became less and less dynamic as the industry sort of contracted and dealt with its various struggles\nUh so I've been very fortunate in a way to be working for such a good newspaper that's gotten better over the years\nAnd uh and to have had the freedom to write all kinds of things all kinds of stuff the arts and culture to be sure but also religion and a lot of cultural issues as well including a lot about race and the African American experience and history and civil rights and so\nLunch counter the students that are for he's were watching uh the students that are in Greensboro and we begin to plan on putting together a demonstration of of the same time and that that was about\nA three three weeks after the um the sit ins in Greensboro the students of vorhees actually well organized and ready to go follow it I was a student at the at the school and I was communities student but\nThe the upper class when I said we need to be the ones on the lines because we don't know what's gonna happen and uh we don't want people to get hurt and all that kind of thing so they said you can watch and you can help plan\nBut you can't participate and that just\nFor me that was just the opening I was really interested in participating not just planning and that kind of thing being in the background but I wanted to to do something myself so that was the beginning of trying to find my way to the front lines and\nAnd the kinds of activities that people were engaged in\nWhat what happened at the city and at the pharmacy in Denmark\nWhat happened was was that the priest and some other administrative officials ah came to the\nWhat happened was was that the priest\nAnd some other administrative officials ah came to the drug so the police were there and they were about the place students and the rest and they told them that they would they would the school would actually sign out for them if they would take them back and uh\nSo that was the way that ended up and they started to come again but then the the ah the college stepped in and and kept it from continuing\nSo the focus of the uh the protests turn in with into the schools efforts to prevent the students from ah protesting\nAnd boy he's college was a religious school it was sponsored by the Episcopal Church still is associated with just one of only two predominantly African American college instead of a a yeah a lot with the Episcopal Church uh and the board\nWas predominantly white yes and the college president a what's called between two worlds\nThe bullet was all white all ... and he was caught between two worlds and so they were saying don't participate don't go along etcetera and that's one of the things that happen\nLater on you have the demonstrations up in Rock Hill the friendship nine friendship nine the group of us are organized and this is where I could actually get engaged and we went up to Rock Hill when they started the jail no bail\nA and there were a number of sick people there so we had a chance to actually be involved and and be in workshops in seminars with the rock killed nine and then ruby Doris in that group or\nAnd in being workshops in seminars with the rock killed nine and then ruby Doris in that group ah from snake actually went to jail and refused to pay any bail than they stayed in jail which galvanize the community and\nRocky all around the city and movement which was very very very positive you\nUse the term snack Adam and I know what what that means if what his what his snake snake is the student\nNonviolent Coordinating committee it's an organization that was formed\nAfter the sit ins had ended up with some fifty thousand students rest it and that was in April of Nineteen sixty\nAnd a group of students who were participants in the movement came together so that could be some coordination\nThere wasn't any coordination for young people and convened by the great Ella Baker to convene by Ella Baker who was at that point program director with this or that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference\nWhich is the organization that Dr King belong to and so they met at Raleigh in Raleigh at Shaw University\nAnd out of that became the beginnings of the student non violent Coordinating Committee and this was going to be student group and Ella Baker is the students to to empower themselves by keeping it\nAutonomous from the other civil rights organization and and develop the kinds of resources and ends and use the kinds of skills and talents that students to come up with and tactics to keep the movement moving along and so that that becomes the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee\nAnd very quickly it spread across the south all across the south uh in fact Adam you've got some statistics and hair comparing\nAnd Coordinating Committee and very quickly it spread across the south all across the south uh in fact Adam you've got some statistics in here comparing the organization and the administration that came into existence almost overnight\nWith snake as compared to the more traditional organizations like the N. double ACP the Congress of racial equality and even the Southern Christian Leadership Conference is this ...\nThis was not a top down move with this with a grassroots movement\nRight right yeah that's right snake was very much decentralized in a way what was interesting about snake though\nIs that it really worked in the weeds you know it was in the towns interacting with people ... the the members of snack and the volunteers this next stayed in the private homes of hosts and\nBorrowed cars and just scrape together resources and just figured out how to do it\nAnd a ... for months and months at a time while some of the other organizations in particular\nMartin Luther king's group would sort of seize opportunities and seek media coverage and kind of swoop in and take charge and so that these two dynamics were working in tandem and in general complimenting one another\nBut sometimes also um conflicting with one another I think it's safe to say that sometimes the snake activists resented Martin Luther king for just kind of taking the spotlight and and claiming credit for all this work that they had done a\nPlay about I'll let you I'll let you as a member of snuck comment on the\nYeah um I I Do say that Ella Baker was a maid you organize it in in the civil rights movement actually within in double ACP she was the person who set up the chapter\nIn in the civil rights movement actually within the N. double ACP she was the person who set up the chapters\nOf the southern N. double ACP across the country or she also um was the program director of a ... and ... group and she always told us it was important\nThat we use programs but we had to organize communities so that we could empower people to take over\nControl of their own destiny is and uh so that was one of the things that we were supposed to do but ah ... didn't have a lot of money we had a lot of commitment and dedication on the part of young people\nAnd so they were willing to go into these project areas across the country a Cambridge, Maryland all the way to Arkansas\nAnd began to work with communities on on you know grass root kinds of programs and\nMost of his centered around fighting in segregation and or the other was registering to vote we thought that that was very important that we secure the the right to vote while we were a organizing in resisting segregation in those particular communities\nWe began to ah to talk about a a larger program and attacking segregation in one of the hottest spots and and America especially most difficult areas for for African Americans we thought was a\nA Mississippi and that if we could go in the Mississippi and kind of break the backbone of segregation and ready to get people registered to vote in Mississippi\nThat if we could go in the Mississippi and kind of break the backbone of segregation and ready to get people registered to vote in Mississippi or that we would we would set an example for many of the of the community is so I went off the Mississippi\nOr in Nineteen sixty full with the Mississippi summer project\nThere were a number of students there eight hundred students all total volunteers that came down most of of the a majority of students came from the major colleges and universities stands for ... to\n... nails or most of the colleges are that you think of as being top flight colleges today\nBut uh we had eight hundred we had a about\nSix or seven hundred of a trend is down in there and we had about a hundred or so doctors\nWe went into the community to to develop a challenge\nTo the Democratic party for the Democratic party to open up and allow blacks to be delegates out of these southern communities\nAnd uh so we all can as what we call the freedom Democratic Party\nAnd we also did work in in in the areas of health or Mississippi has some bad case ... and other diseases that were commonplace that were caused by malnutrition and those kinds of things so\nWe began to change from being the activists who we're integrating the bowling alleys and activists who are demonstrating against the kind of segregated facilities that still existed\nHe is retiring a retired in process retiring and er he got his wish he sent me a lot at one time that actually said don't stay in that long ago come on back you've had you your time in and I'd rather for you to come home\nNow than to be a did he role\nSo I understood what was going on with him and and it was time for me to change gear for a minute and so that's what I did that letters in the book yes or no yeah\nBut it was it was it was an interesting that I keep it posted 'cause I Want to remember that while we've had differences in who should be doing what and when the question about any kind of integrity uh honesty and all that kind of thing it was\nHad differences in who should be doing what and when the question about any kind of integrity uh honesty and all that kind of thing it was that he was frightened and he was concerned and I can understand that [noise] can you imagine the sort of\n[noise] the feeling that uh his father must have had at the time of\nAn older generation very in industry is very entrepreneurial very successful\nA black man of proud black man in Denmark South Carolina running a taxi business renting homes running this cafe I mean he he was known in the community in a motel and I'll tell ya and ... and and he knew\nOn on one hand that his son was doing this important work\nThat needed to be done he he understood the injustice that he faced every day\nOn the one hand but on the other hand he's a father he's a father who's worried about his son and his son is getting himself into these very dangerous situation\nWithin a lotta he tells me that he has built this motel for me and so all they had to come back and he turned it over to them it come just come home [noise] I don't you\nGet a sense from his ... his talking here that [noise] you know his life has been this amazing a park and I think ... people\nThose of your listeners who might recognize the name Cleveland Sellers probably associate him with the Orangeburg massacre\nAnd one of the things I Try to do in the book is contextualize the Orangeburg massacre it was clearly a watershed moment for you but it was also an episode one of many in this long life\nOf activism and um and it fits\nAn episode one of many in this long life of activism\nAnd um and it fits into that long life of a I Wish it hadn't happened it was a terrible tragedy I mean three young men were killed and at least twenty eight were wounded some pretty badly\nShot in the soles of their feet and then their backs as they were trying to escape the gunfire on campus they were all unarmed\nUm after this protested the bowling alley or they'd gathered on campus and there was this terrible episode with the national guard in the state troopers and so on called in and it just got out of control\nAnd we've got caught up in that he wasn't there to organize that or to participate in the Orangeburg massacre he was there\nTo explore opportunities to further his own education he was there to mentor young students he was there with a black power ideology mind you\nTo talk about I ... issues of identity and the future and the things that were really important I think he was a little frustrated to see\nAt least initially to see that these students were obsessed about desegregated bowling alley you know in in early Nineteen sixty eight that was like so Nineteen sixty three you know [laughter] and here's sleeve looking at these kids saying okay I get it but we got bigger fish to fry\nAnd instead they focused on the bowling alley\nAnd it escalated and escalate and and cleave just sort of got caught in the crossfire literally\n[noise] and actually Adam you address this hour and a the segregated world\nThat in many ways your father prospered through that ... the business world disappeared because of\nThat in many ways your father prospered through that ... the business world disappeared because of\nThe success of the civil rights movement\nThat's correct yes his son's success sort of destroyed the world he knew yeah in a good way in ... in a sense but also a good way but there were the the these [noise] unintended consequences or unexpected repercussions yeah\nYeah I I I say a lot of times that um you know when when black folk found freedom\nWife all guys became coal it in black folk ice [laughter] so that's the way I deal with that when you know but it it is what it is but I think again you have to decide\nWhat you're doing how you're going with the values that ... that implicit in we had to to so justice and equality in certain amount of peace or you have to fight for it wouldn't\nYou say that that you and your colleagues in the middle sixties sort of had an inkling of the future sort of understood that\nIntegration what's happening but that it came with certain risks to the black community and I'm all that sort of fueled a little bit the black power movement\nWell that's that's why you see the movement continue it it just doesn't stop\nBecause people will say okay well why didn't you stop after you\nGot the Nineteen fifty for civil rights bill why don't you stop after the voting rights bill why don't you stop after whatever was going on and what we kept saying is is that is not over it's not finishes not complete we have things that we need to do [noise]\nGot caught up in the war in Vietnam\nIs that is not over is not finished is not complete we have things that we need to do [noise]\nGot caught up in the war in Vietnam that was the next movement and so it just kept escalating and then we talked about\nUh bringing and other entities as a Native Americans and and a Cesar Chavez and a Puerto Rican community and and just building on coalition to to deal with all the issues of poverty and\nDestitution and and bad health and pull education and all those things which are fundamental to ensuring the quality of life\n... was a remarkable organization when you think about it I mean here here's this relatively small group I mean I remember the the civil rights me and we think of the civil rights when these marches and we see these photos of all these people\nThat the activists who are on the frontline were few maybe a few hundred ... what'd you say yeah and then there were volunteers who came in and people who came in and out of the movement and there were lawyers people who helped in various ways but the people fighting the fight on a consistent basis were relatively few\nIn relatively few organizations and yet those organizations accomplished so much snack\nTo my mind snakes ceded\nAll of this this this universe of acronyms you know these new organizations that flew out of the sixties into the seventies and into the eighties\nThey in a way they can all trace their roots back to snack and not just the organization that certain individuals within the organization who then went on to do other things including cleave in Greensboro in elsewhere I mean new organizations with new acronyms were spawned by snake art we need to power\nTo do other things including cleats in Greensboro in elsewhere I mean new organizations with new acronyms were spawned by snake art we need to pause for a moment let our listeners know that this is Walter it\nCause journal I'm Talking with Adam Parker adopt a Cleveland Sellers about Adams new biography of Dr sellers outside agitator\nWe're going to jump from orange after the Orangeburg I Want to get back to your dad were your folks are still alive when you came back to South Carolina a check to the to the university and you're no\nNo my um my folks both had cancer\nAnd my mother had breast cancer and my father had prostate cancer and I I made an effort to come from Greensboro which is where I was and um come back to South Carolina but uh it was it was obvious that the the word was out that\nNo where would I be able to get a job in South Carolina\nI didn't have that problem in North Carolina but in South Carolina it was completely shut off so my parents both died in Nineteen Ninety\nMy ah father died for ... in February and my mother in August you know gosh and so you know I never could get\nA back and then I decided that you know I had to always talked about going back to South Carolina this was a time when I had to make up her mind so I just came back without a job in anything else and move back to Denmark and are just kind of scratched it out\nOr steal that that restriction on employment was as well not available\nBest best because you had been arrested tried and convicted after orange\nEmployment was as well not available\nWell that's that's because you had been arrested tried and convicted after Orangeburg [laughter] you'd served some time in jail\n... and that's what the rationale will he had a criminal record and that got on the way yes\nWell they made sure to get in the way the FBI would come in and and talked institutions and
