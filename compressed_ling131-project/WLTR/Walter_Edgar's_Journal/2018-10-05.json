W. F. in Pensacola, Florida is Katherine Clark\nShe's the creator of an oral biography my exaggerated life Pat Conroy as told to Katherine Clark and so Catherine welcome to Walter Edgar struggle\nThank you for having any longer [noise]\nWhy don't you tell me well first of all I Need to let our folks know that I first got to know you from an earlier oral biography milking the moon\nWhich was about an incredibly fabulous molded you in the late Eugene Walter I didn't happen to know him personally but I knew everybody else who used to hang out at the whole book shop with him like Caldwell delaying a andme Air France has plumber\nAnd camera and plumber so I don't think I've laughed more when I've read a biography of what I read milking the moon it was an incredible thank you\nThank you thank you\nSo you had had experience getting individuals to open up and really kind of ... bill everything to you that takes a lot of talent\nI don't know I think it takes luck I was very lucky to cross paths with two incredible southern characters\nThat first or I'll biography I did was with a a black mid life\nWho had worked as a maid in the deal but was also a midwife had been a midwife for almost forty years and she wanted to write a book about her experiences delivering babies the only problem lies she didn't know how to write\nIt says delivering babies the only problem was she didn't know how to write\nAnd my cousin married into the family that she worked for as a maid and knowing that I was interested in southern history in southern culture as well as writing he put me together with her\nAs soon as I met her I knew that I wanted the book to be in her voice and I simply sat down with her and started recording her\nThat didn't take any real ability at all it just took the luck of meeting this fascinating character who definitely had a story to tell\nAnd the same thing happened with Eugene Walter uh I was it still immobile when the book with a midwife came out\nIt was called a mother with an Alabama midwives story and Eugene said to me now darling you must do your next one\nAbout that and finally one day the light bulb went off in my head and I I I realize heck I'd always wanted to be a novelist here this was life telling me to write a novel finally\nSo that's what I did\nWhen it came out how to the people in Birmingham remote and broke react\nI all I saw was a wonderful reaction because Pat Conroy accompanied me to Birmingham for the launch of the book\nAnd it it took place in at my my old high school\nWhere all the people who attended the launch and there were a lot of them were familiar with the teacher that I had based my main character on and they were all very grateful that that I had written a novel they said oh you brought him back to life\nAnd I think they were all very gratified for the recognition of Pat Conroy of their school and of this teacher who had been such a big part of the school\nSo I I didn't really have to be subjected to the general mountain broke reaction I saw a very select slice that was based around the the community\nAll mountain broke reaction I saw a very select slice that was based around the community of of\nMy school well the reason are through that out there is because when we get around to to ... one of the things he says throughout your conversations is every bookie published teach somebody off\nRight [laughter] right yes\nIt's almost as if he were courting that kind of reaction although his first book the blue which was based upon an officer there on the faculty of the of the sort of do right he meant that as a tribute to the ... and\n... and yes and it was a tribute and pat was completely unprepared for the negative reaction that the citadel had to the book but it was because the citadel had demoted\nThe heat he had been demoted from the commandant of cadets to some lowly job ordering supplies in a warehouse and the citadel took it as a criticism of them and they ... they banned the book and\nAnd there was this hue and cry and pat was completely unprepared for that\nWell first of all he is who sort of do graduate he wears the ring he's over his lifetime he had a love hate relationship with the institution but when you say things like lesser men got rid of our greater my on yeah that's pretty incendiary\nBut yet it went through several printing's largely because ... alumni ...\n... well past said whenever you you ban a book sales go through the roof so the sales were good but a pat didn't like the criticism that was her\nThrough the roof so the sales were good but a pat didn't like the criticism that was her old his why didn't think he had deserved that and it upset him\nWell you know it's interesting because on a number of occasions in in your conversation she said she never read this book for us that came out and you never read what everybody said about um well we know during good and well he read what people said about his books\n[noise] well I think he did early on I Do believe that one of the\nThings he did to protect himself was to wean himself away from reading reviews of his works because they're often was\nSuch a of a vitriolic reaction from various segments of the community he lived in or his family\nAnd he had to he called it the shield he had to Iraq to shield\nBetween himself and public reaction to his works\nShe did but this is the same ... that I witnessed sitting two three four hours signing books and talking partially to everybody who came through that loan yes\nI mean there was another there was another ... he didn't he didn't put a shield between himself and\nAnd his readers notice raiders\nNo he no not at all the shield was between himself\nAnd the critics and also we had several conversations about the shield for the book and some of this ... went into the book the shield was also something to uh protect him from\nSome of this ... went into the book the shield was also something to uh protect him from the side effects of fame he didn't even want to read articles about himself\nI remember asking him about that article that the New York times published after he had reconciled with the citadel\nAnd it was a it was a it was a feel good story if ever there was one it re hashed\nAll the the years of negativity and criticism and recrimination between pat and his college trace the whole journey from the starting point to to the reconciliation and the resolution and it was a it was a great article and I asked him about it\nAnd he was not aware of of what was in the article\nAnd I ... this is how I found out that he didn't read about himself and and he he knew the article had been published and he was quoted in the article but he never he never read the published article itself and that's when he told me I don't read about myself\nI don't think it's healthy I ... I see my name and an article and I turn the page and so the shield was to protect him from critics and it was ... to protect him from\nSide effects of fame but he loved his fans he loved his readers and I had in in in one of our conversations I asked him how he felt about never winning any major literary prizes like the national Book Award or the fuel that surprise\nAnd he had this to say he said well\nHe thought to a certain extent he was being quote unquote punished for being commercially successful and then he wasn't even considered for literary\nCertain extent he was being quote unquote punished for being commercially successful and then he wasn't even considered for literary awards because if his words if his works for popular and commercially successful then held literary could they be\nThat was one thing he said but what else he said was very interesting he said [noise]\nI really don't care about the prize is because I have the best readers\nIn the world my readers actually they don't just by my books they read my books and they love my books and they come talk to me about my books and how my books have helped them and that meant the world to pat that was the reason that he wrote\nAnd I think he got so much gratification from having these readers come up and share their stories with him and tell him how much his works had to help them with their suffering in their their pain\nCancer in that way they do to do a station break this was Walter ... and I'm Talking with Katherine Clark about her ... Pat Conroy entitled my exaggerated life I was told to Catherine\nPark before the break up and we were talking about this shield that Pat Conroy set up between himself and\nThe critics but also shielding himself from getting a big head and one of the individuals who influenced him greatly in terms of writing and so forth was\nThe late poet James Dickey pap talked about one of the things problems with Jim Dickey in his later life is he was never the same after deliver ups the mail\nAnd pat was action\nAnd his later life is she was a member of the same after delivering the mail\nAnd pat was actually in his classroom when deliverance was being filmed and Dicky was a consultant for the film and was often away filming\nAnd would come back to the classroom and start bragging\nAbout how he had shown the actors this that or the other and they didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to say it and he had to he had to show them how to do this that or the other and he was so full of ... and\nPat was taking all this in\nPad at this point had only self published the his first book the water is wide which was published by a a New York house had not yet come out so pat is very much\nA fledgling writer at this point so he is observing this writer at the peak of his career become a brag art\nAnd ... and then at one point brag about having slept with all the women in the class and [noise] ... would observe him walking around campus with a trail of female undergraduates walking behind him and\nAnd it was ten ... ten am his time yeah we talk for about an hour to an hour and a half sometimes six days a week sometimes if if he felt like it he would call me on Saturday and then we'd record\nAgain it was the privilege of a lifetime and I I thought initially\nThat I was going to need to do this project like I had done the other two I was in the room with the midwife I was in the room with Eugene Walter when I recorded them and certainly Eugene Walter needed a live audience Eugene was a performer\nAnd he knew he needed that audience that he was looking at\nAnd talking to and he could see their reactions and their facial expressions and he needed that immediate gratification and I\nI just assume that any rock hunter and pat was certainly Iraq hunter as well as a great writer I just assume that any rack hunter would need a live audience and so we initially did a few\n[noise] I just assume that any rack hunter would need a live audience and so we initially did a few interviews in person\nBut what's interesting Walter I found out that pat was actually more guarded with me in person than he was on the phone he seemed a little shy he didn't he didn't reveal ... guts as much or didn't seem to me to be as free\nWhen he was in the same room with me and I remember thinking to myself I'm you know I think it might be better if we're not in the same room when I'm recording him because I was assuming I'd have to go up to ... spent a summer and be for it\nAnd record him and we also had this report are of talking on the phone and we've been doing it for years so we had we had a groove\nAnd so I I proposed that we try recording on the phone and it worked out great\nIt it really wasn't like interviewing him at all it was just like an extension of the conversations that we had been having four years\nHow did you go about taking this world of of material producing a book the\nRecordings were professionally transcribed\nAnd I'd I'd put all these ... pages in hundreds of pages of transcripts and binders and just started reading through I'm\nBlacking out sections I knew would not be useful and highlighting sections that I Would and so that's the first step and then I start just reading my highlighted\nPassages and then just sort of let that settle in my mind and start thinking of how I might want to organize the material\nAnd then just sort of let that saddle in my mind and start thinking of how I might want to organize than the Cherry Hill so everything is patch words it's just I has selected what words go on the page and what order they appear\nWell there Jim throughout the book but just in the very first chapter he's trying to get the water is why a ... a New York publisher and actually try to get an agent uh he's told he needs an agent and somebody gives them more of a very famous New York agent\nAnd he gets put through by shooting a typical Conroy story about being a distant cousin [laughter] agent and a half to report somebody's family death or an agent when he gets through this BS\nSlammed the phone down and Congress right then writes\nA letter [laughter] yes dear Mr Bach\nObviously your soul has with ... in the canyons of New York city\nAnd the allies in darkness that you walk through to get to your office each day whatever your mother thought when you were born when you were ... at her breast she did not know what a small team and she was making ... D is courtesy I have never encountered in my life before\nAnd I hope I never do again\nAnd he sent that let her off it got a reaction from the agent who after electric car rebelled being rude and saying he was a loser said send me the manuscript\n[laughter] and the rest is history [noise] yes yes uh yes\nCatherine I mean I can hear pat saying that I mean he yeah he has his way with words I bet Julian block had never been talked to like that\nAnd obviously he hadn't because it it did get it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom and these conversations we're proud of both the biography and then share a couple of your favorite stores\nOkay well I I I'm Glad you asked this question because there are lots of things that came out in our conversations that I didn't really have a way to put in the book because of the way I was doing the book as a narrative rather than as a question and answer\nType of format a book but one of the things I asked pat in one of our conversations was for him to I said what were the five happiest times of your life\n[noise] Okay Number one was his year of teaching at different high school that was the year after he graduated from the citadel\nThe set his second favorite memory was of the trip he took to Europe the summer after that first year of teaching a when he went with Bernie shine his best friend from forever and two other teachers\nAs a second favorite memory third favorite memories third best moment of his life was his senior year at the citadel he said because he knew he was going to get out of the flies\nAnd the other two happiest moments best memories or basketball games that he played for the ...\nAnd ... are you serious he said absolutely perfectly serious said those are your five happiest moments those are the five best moments of your life [noise]\nHe said yes what's wrong with that [laughter] I said well for one thing all of these moments happened before your first book was published and he just started laughing almost hysterically he said are you serious I said pat think about\nFor your first book was published and he just started laughing almost hysterically is that are you serious I said pat think about if all of this happened before you published anything\nAnd he said well he said I guess that's right because publishing has brought me almost nothing but grief\nAnd he was very serious about that publishing his books because they all cause to storm the boot cause this storm\nThe ... uh the water is wide caused a an uproar with his community and to a certain extent what the state of South Carolina and then the great sand teeny caused his family\nTo turn against him not his siblings but his parents and grandparents aunts uncles cousins uh lords of discipline the sitter does after Mali and he said it just brought so much stress and anxiety into my life\nAnd he said I've never gotten rid of it and I've never recovered from all that\nSo that really really brought home to me\nHow he has struggled with uh the after effects of publishing his books and he struggled with demons all his life that his his his five happiest memories are best moments are from before his publishing career took off and this is a man who achieved\nYou know international fame and success with his books\nAnd yet his happiest times or before they came out that's very telling and then there was a similar moment I I 'cause I had the next day I think it was I asked him\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Walter Edgar's Journal", "city": "Columbia", "day": "05"}
