twenty five years of experience her books include the hormone cure the hormone reset diet and younger\nDoctor Godfrey ... I think that um\nThere's a lot of confusion around hormones in general and testosterone in particular\nThere for a while there were TV commercials that were sort of highlighting low testosterone levels low T I think is the way they refer to them and then the FDA got very excited and those those commercials seemed to disappear pretty quickly the FDA basically said\nDoctors do not prescribe testosterone two men unless they have a real serious condition\nJust having low testosterone that doesn't count and there's all kinds of warnings about heart attacks and strokes it'll just all kinds of scary stuff around testosterone\nI Wonder if you have any thoughts about testosterone supplementation for men especially if they have low T and then a cherry has a question about testosterone supplementation for women\n[noise]\nSure why I think this is one of those situations where the pendulum swings towards testosterone and that away from it\nAnd in part I think that's in a context of\nOne of the biggest studies that was published on hormones this time for winning the women's health initiative so let me talk about that for a moment then I'll come back to men because in two thousand to about twenty three percent of American women were taking hormone therapy\nAnd then when the results came out that synthetic hormones as studied in the women's health initiative were dangerous and provocative\nAnd then when the results came out that synthetic hormones as studied in the women's health initiative weren't dangerous and provocative much of the time it lead to millions of women stopping their hormones and when you dropping their hormones you mean stopping after June ...\n[noise] that's right so synthetic versions so what was studied in women's health initiative was ... and ... they're kind of I think of them as the doubles we know\nSo we went from twenty three percent taking hormones to five percent which I think is too low I think we actually need to be somewhere in the middle\nBut the other thing that this did decides scaring millions of women and getting them off their hormones is that it made the FDA so sensitive and so fearful of recommending hormone therapy without long term randomized trials to support\nThe use of it and so I think we are now living in a post women's health initiative era where\nWe don't have enough options we don't have enough\nConsensus around safe ways to prescribe things like testosterone for men or even testosterone for women so I think you know it's an unfortunate situation\nYou know I'm not as current with the literature on low T and men and Andrew pause and the use of testosterone therapy I certainly have patients who are on it um and my sense is often this comes down to a quality of life decision\nAnd I can tell you you know I'm not a fan of men frosting themselves an excessive testosterone that's never a good idea but for men who have a low level of testosterone and that's well documented and we're getting them back into the physiologic range\nI think there's a strong argument to be made for that approach let me ask you about\nPhysiologic range I think there's a strong argument to be made for that approach\nLet me ask you about testosterone for women because the FDA has pretty much discouraged its use and yet my understanding is that for some women really can make a difference for a low libido has\nThat been your experience and is there evidence that that's the case\nThere is evidence so ... you know what I can speak to you from the evidence and from what we know from the scientific literature and then I can also speak to you as a clinician on the front lines who prescribes testosterone for women\nAnd so in the first category you're right the FDA has really there's no FDA approved form of testosterone for women everything that's FDA approved as for men and sometimes we\nYou know cut patches and do other things to try to make it work for women but the doses are very high and it just doesn't translate\nAnd this is based on\nA few randomized trials one that stands out in my mind is one from the Massachusetts General hospital by ... where she showed that women after hysterectomy and after having their ovaries removed that's you know the clinical situation where you're estrogen Andrew testosterone goes down to a very low level\nIn those women if you give them a testosterone patch they end up having sex about ... more per month compared to women not on the testosterone patch\nSo this study is what made the FDA turned down approval of the testosterone patch for women this was maybe ten or Fifteen Years ago and we've really not had a lot of activities since then\nNow the problem is just looking at how often you have intercourse isn't the best measure of a woman sexual experience and\nNow the problem is just looking at how often you have intercourse isn't the best measure of a woman sexual experience and so this has been kind of authority tricky issue and clinically the way that I've dealt with it is to say to my patients\nYou know what we're going to do first is we're going to get your hormones back in the balance starting first with estrogen and protest Ronan cortisol and thyroid\nAnd I'm going to see where you are with your libido if you still have decreased libido and I have ways that I measure that then we may want to consider adding on some testosterone cream and I tell them you know listen there's no FDA approved formulation for this so it means that\nWe're basically involved in ... an experiment here but I can also tell you after taking care of twenty five thousand patients that I have a lot of patients who are on testosterone cream and say that it improves their quality of life it improves their sex life it improves their connection with her partner so that the potential risks\nAre worth it so those risks are things like liver function issues so I follow liver enzymes every uh\nSix weeks to twelve weeks on my patients who are taking testosterone there's also some very limited data that there may be a fall increased risk of breast cancers that we do everything we can from\nGenomic testing to buy a marker testing to reduce that risk of breast cancer as low as possible but those are some of the risks and it ends up being a quality of life decision that we renegotiate every three to six months when I see them in the office [noise]\nThere there may be some very specific situations where you would say well probably you don't want to take this risk or are you sure you really want to take this risk for example someone who is making her living as a singer\nProbably you don't want to take this risk or are you sure you really want to take this risk for example someone who is making her living as a singer I'm might not want to risk the possibility that testosterone would change her vocal Tambor\n[noise] that's right I mean the votes the voice lowering effect is one of those risks that as part of informed consent with testosterone therapy [noise] but I can also tell you that with my patients I'm so careful to make sure that we're\nIn the middle of the physiologic range and so side effects related to um what I Would call ... symptoms so that's total medical language let me translate it for you\nSo for patients who have a voice lowering effect that tends to be when you're a super physiologic so you have levels of testosterone that are beyond the normal range\nAnother um sign of having too much testosterone is increased size of the color is so you know we're watching for those things it's part of the informed consent but if you have a patient who's within that physiologic range the chance of it is very low\n[noise] duck the Godfrey a lot of women are aware that they may experience some changes in sexual function around menopause\nBut I think that most people have an idea that once you're past menopause you're not interested in sex anymore that's really not a reasonable assumption is it well\nIt's just such a personal decision I Believe and I you know I'm careful not to take my own values and my own attitude about sex and projected onto my patients\nZero nine to that's one eight

problems that may not be suitable for young listeners many medications can interfere with libido and sexual satisfaction are people warned about such side effects when they get a prescription\nOur guest is Dr Sara got fried she's a board certified gynecologist with more than twenty five years of experience her books include the hormones your the hormone reset diet and younger\nDoctor Godfrey that you mentioned that when you went to your family physician with some of the problems that you're experiencing the answer was an anti depressant\nAnd you also mentioned that some of your patients come in with mood disorders and I suspect that a lot of health care professionals would prescribe an anti depressant for someone who complained of feeling down in the dumps\nThe only trouble with those drugs is that they have a fairly high rate of sexual dysfunction\nA four men it may be an inability to achieve or gas and but that may be true for women as well and it may also lower libido so can you give us a your perspective on many of the medications that are prescribed that have this\nPerhaps unexpected and on disgust me this is not something a lot of health professionals like to talk about oh I'm I'm prescribing you Prozac and by the way it might ruin you\nDisgust me this is not something a lot of health professionals like to talk about oh I'm I'm prescribing you Prozac and by the way it might ruin your love life how do you deal with that\n[noise]\nLove this question so I you know I I think if you look at\nThe most unbiased data on antidepressants and their role in depression which you find is that they are often worse than placebo in terms of effectiveness for mild to moderate depression for severe depression I think they you can make an argument to prescribe but\nThe majority of patients that icy have mild to moderate depression and I think they have no business being prescribed in anti depressant I think they ... they need lifestyle medicine they need treatments that are designed to help them with the level of inflammation in their body which\nIs at the root of why they feel depressed\nSo you know we we live in an era with a broken healthcare system if I step back for a moment and I know because I trained within it so I'm trained as a traditional physician and it's a it's an era of the pills for every all [noise]\nAnd I think we found that this strategy has failed\nWe need a different strategy we know that about Seventy percent of health care costs are lifestyle related and I think the mood is a really good example so if we just if we just look at the hormonal drivers of mood for a moment we know that about fifty percent of people who are depressed have high cortisol levels\nIs that being checked by every primary care doctor who sees the patient who complains of depression no we know that about twenty percent of patients with depression have a lower thyroid a function and that is tested a little more often but you know I I think it's\nWith depression have a low thyroid a function and that is tested a little more often but you know I I think it's\nTo me it's crucial to do a root cause now says when you have a patient with the mood issue and to look at what I consider and women at least to be the hormonal Charlie's Angels to look at cortisol to look at thyroid and to look at estrogen\nSo for so many women will for all women estrogen is a master regulator\nAnd when you start to make less of it beginning in your forties sometimes in your fifties it can cause mood issues and so to me the first treatment should be to get those hormones back in the balance not to reach for the Prozac or some other anti depressant so you're right I mean I Wish that every patient was given\nFull informed consent about the adverse risks of being prescribed antidepressants I think we unfortunately just live in a time where the average appointment with a a doctor in the U. S. is seven minutes and it's often faster and quicker to prescribe the Prozac\nOr whatever selects that whatever the new anti depressant is rather than to really get to the root cause\nI'm suspecting that you have a number of patients who have come in your office and after you get done talking with him and eventually they say well you I Am having some libido issues and and sex isn't like it used to be\nYou find out that yeah they're taking some ball to or they're taking so Alexa or they're taking Alexa pro or filling the blank there were a dozen of them\nAnd millions or tens of millions of people are relying on these medications on a daily basis whether they're helpful or not how do you how do you interact with a patient who is complaining of sexual dysfunction but has been on an antidepressant for months or years\nWell we know we know from the best statistics\nBut has been on an antidepressant for months or years\n[noise] well we know we know from the best statistics that went in for American women over the age of forty has taken anti depressant and that's the number is double in my practice so about half my patients come in taking antidepressants so what I Do is\nI'm not someone who immediately removed every pharmaceutical that a patient is taking I don't think that serves some well\nBut what we want to do is take a look at OK what's happening with your body right now what's working well what ... what some of the intelligent design that we can enhance what's happening with your hormones and could we start to naturally balance those hormones and once you start feeling better\nStart to withdraw the anti depressant so there's some antidepressants that she can stop and not have dramatic withdrawal symptoms from there are others where that's far less the case such as flex a pro and so I have a strategy that I use with\nBalancing hormones and also you know not just the hormones but what's happening in terms of your nutrients are you eating the foods that support a good mood are you getting the exercise that you need which I think is one of the best forms of anti depressant I think of it not as you know some it's good for your heart but it's also incredibly good for your mood\nYou know what about your connection with others argue socially isolated purpose and meaning\nSo it's to me it's a much broader context from which to discuss whether someone should continue taking an antidepressant and similar to what I said about taking hormones it's not a yes no answer it's more okay\nYou've been taking the symbol to for ten years how do you feel on it what were you like before have you gained weight\nWhat can we do to support you better what\nTo for ten years how do you feel on it what were you like before have you gained weight what can we do to support you better what are your goals do you want to get off of it you know not just going to project my own views about anti depressant on to all my patients so that gives you a little flavor I Hope of\nHow I approach this in my practice absolutely on e you have mentioned root cause analysis so I'm guessing that all these things go into your root cause analysis [noise]\nYes definitely you know I I start with\nFood [laughter] and it's I feel like food as such important information for your body I don't think of it as calories I don't think of it is you know fuel I think of it as information for your DNA tell us a bit more about that if you would please sure [noise]\nWell you know I think if you look at an ancestral health perspective we had a certain way of eating\nIn our paleolithic times that was a good match for DNA and what's happened in the past especially one hundred years is that the way that we've eaten has dramatically completely changed\nNow that's also along with the change that we talked about earlier with stress with high perceive stress and the two kind of are in lockstep\nSo I'm a big fan of starting first with someone's diet and that doesn't it doesn't matter whether they're kind of silly because of decrease libido or they're coming to see me because they want to reduce the risk of breast cancer or um they're having menopausal symptoms and can't sleep at night\nIt doesn't really matter what the chief complaint is what matters is\nYou know those kind of system spaced analysis starting first with food\nSo I Want to know where your nutrients coming from when are you eating what are you eating\nIt's kind of systems based analysis starting first with food\nSo I Want to know where nutrients coming from when are you eating what are you eating whom are you eating with and how can we take where you are right now and make sure that you're getting the nutrients that you need the macro nutrients micro nutrients the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Walter Edgar's Journal", "city": "Columbia", "day": "07"}
