vitamin D and calcium and other minerals we know that they're absolutely essential for bone strength\nBut this study that was published in jama not too very long ago\nChallenged a lot of people's thinking especially with regard to dietary supplements like calcium and vitamin D it was a meta analysis they reviewed a number of randomized clinical trials and concluded\nThat taking supplements don't do anything to prevent fractures compared to placebo why do you challenge that\nWell or towns that are on the basis of first of all it's a meta analysis\nAnd in general I have skepticism about them because they tend to be biased to them now and this particular study examined do very large number of meta analyses [noise]\nUh I Can't even remember the number but it was in the in the range of something like forty or fifty and they were hugely different in their study designed\nIt was in the in the range of something like forty or fifty and they were hugely different in their study designs\nAnd so I I really don't accept it meta analyses are are a problem because uh the study designs are always different you know in the different studies that are included in in the case of nutritional studies it's particularly a problem\nBecause these studies are all double blind placebo controlled trials well that's the design that pharmaceutical companies use to test\nDrugs for four years and advocacy and safety but in the case of the pharmaceutical agent the placebo group has none of the pharmaceutical agent on board but on the case in the case of a nutritional supplements and everybody has some of the nutritional\nSupplement in question on board\nOr they'd be disease you can make 'em disease\nTo noted right I mean they do their diet in other words we're all getting calcium

Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expanded\nWelcome back to the people's pharmacy Dr Walter Willett it's so nice to have you back on our air\nOf thank you and good to be back with your\nDoctor will it or we saw a study a last year that was published in the journal of the American Medical Association which was a meta analysis of thirty three clinical trials they looked at supplements of calcium and vitamin D\nAnd whether or not that kept people from breaking bones they concluded\nDid not make any difference what's your take on this research place\nWhere this area of calcium and vitamin D and bone health is really a complicated area and uh I think the Smith analysis didn't really help us sort out the complexity and as far from a final answer on this topic [noise]\nAh there were several issues a boat one very important issue is that the amount of vitamin D and the foreman which are the way in which vitamin D is administered can make a very big difference and results\nThat are the studies lumped together a randomized trials for vitamin D that gave the vitamin D\nVery big difference in results that are this study lumped together a randomized trials for vitamin D\nThat gave the vitamin D in different ways I including giving it in one injection for a whole year of very large amount or sometimes so once every month and especially when given once a year in very large amount there is pretty strong evidence from a large trial that that actually can increase\nThe risk of fractures that's of course are very on natural way of giving vitamin D traditionally record in the sun and get a little bit every day I Am much more sort of steady form of administration\nAnd that we don't totally understand why giving a huge amount all at once can be bad for you but there's some reasonable hypotheses why that could be a problem and the evidence suggests that it is\nIf you do look at the studies that gave a reasonable does more than the old idea of four hundred international units and gave it in a more constant way uh those uh do show some benefits of vitamin D and Boeing fracture risk [noise]\nAnother problem with this limitation of this analysis was excluded studies that were done on institutionalized or individuals like people living in assisted living our nursing homes\nAnd um [noise] those ... their people to it's true that there are levels of vitamin D may be on average lower because he may not get out in the sun\nAs much but uh in those kinds of studies the quality of study can actually be higher because you have a better chance of making sure people received their dose on a regular basis and some of the trials were included in that met in Alice ...\nThere was a ... large loss to participation are people taking their vitamin D so then and now she's become almost a plague basically that anybody with a guy who can connect with\nDave so many now she's become almost a plague basically that anybody where the guy who can connect with the Internet ah basically can do and I met in Alice ... villagers piling up with that analysis that I really I think misleading [noise]\nA good bit of noises that there will be several quite large and I think pretty well done studies\nThat a lookout vitamin ... that will become they've finished already in fact a few months ago they're actively analyzing that data and so hopefully within next year we'll have quite a bit more evidence on this important topic\nNow Dr we'll let you have\nBeen involved in literally hundreds of research studies over decades and a lot of your work has been in in the field of nutrition and I I've I've long wondered why it is that some investigators think that they should treat\nNutrients like drugs and so you know you've mentioned these very large injectable doses of vitamin D fifty thousand a hundred thousand units and\nAnd then they ... they look in amazement when they go well that that wasn't helpful or maybe it was even counterproductive and you say well Mother Nature never intended us to get this gigantic amount of vitamin D all at once rather than the way it was supposed to be which is a small amount every day\nSo why do you think they even designed those studies that way\n[noise] I had a good question I think maybe it's a little naive I'm at in some ways it's that I wouldn't criticize people too harshly for doing\nThose studies or just that they need to be very careful about the conclusions vitamin D is stored and if you could get the benefits from a single dose once a year that would be very nice but\nVery careful about the conclusions vitamin D is stored and if you could get the benefits from a single dose once a year that would be very nice\nBut I think the issue it turns out that that doesn't look like Kevin could actually be some harm but it's just if we generalize the findings from those kinds of very abnormal kind of\nTrials to conclude that vitamin D isn't in journal beneficial that's ... that's the real problem\n[noise] catch it will let the other nutrients that was included in this meta analysis was calcium\nAnd you and we have talked about calcium supplements in the past but not all of our listeners have heard your ideas about calcium supplements so please tell us should we all be taking calcium supplements to keep our bones strong\nYeah ... another good question and again this is complicated because we know that vitamin or the calcium is absolutely essential a place many functions including keeping our heart rhythm are orderly uh a is a critical\nPart of foreign competition and so we have to get some calcium so\nThe issue is how much and we also know that like most essential nutrients if you get too much you actually can cause harm so uh it's finding that sweet spot audits are a real game\nAnd the amounts of calcium that we need our I think are not totally clear at this point in time but the way the amount of calcium requirement is set in the United states\nIs on the basis of very short term studies that last just two or three weeks basically looking at how much calcium can we sort of forcing to the bone during a period of ... just a few weeks\nAnd that almost surely will give us a misleading answer because we know that you get some short term changes in bones\nJust a few weeks and that almost surely will give us a misleading answer because we know that you get some short term changes in bone density that do not reflect what happens in the long run that's very well established and so we have requirements that are set on these very short term studies\nAnd you get results saying we need a for over fifty twelve hundred milligrams a day\nWhich means almost for sure you need to be taking a couple of servings a day of dairy products to get up to that level whereas the world Health Organization has a step back and look at the bigger global picture and they noticed what has actually been known for quite a few decades\nThat the countries that consume the most dairy and have the highest calcium and takes actually have the highest fracture it's in the world that's northern Europe in the United states in countries that do not consume dairy\nAnd have a much lower calcium and takes they still of course are getting some calcium or they have the lowest fracture rights so we I think we can't conclude from that kind of study that\nA calcium and ... cause it's fractures but it does seem pretty clearly that we don't need to have these very high and takes a calcium and Jerry to ... to be able to have low rates of fractures\nUK looked at the evidence and they came up with seven hundred milligrams of calcium instead of the five hundred milligrams of the world Health Organization sued was adequate far below the U.S\nNumbers so whether we need five hundred seven hundred I think is uh that's probably closer to uh the correct answer not to twelve hundred milligrams\nAnd of course if we need seven hundred or you can get to that where if you're ever going to die without any\nA theory on the next conversations from the world cafe\nThis evening at six [noise]\nOh South Carolina public radio weekly and daily

nutritional foundation for strong bones what supplements might you need to prevent osteoporosis or or supplements a waste of time and money\nOur guest is Dr Walter Willett professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T H Chan School of public health\nDr Willett is also professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school he's co author of eat drink and to be healthy the Harvard Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expand it\nWillett [laughter] you know the vitamin D story is so fascinating to me because the epidemiology and you are\nSort of in some respects you know the father of epidemiology and the twenty first century I mean you've been guiding so many um of your medical students and your colleagues in this field\nThe epidemiology suggested vitamin D is essential for so many things and yet some of the randomized double blind placebo controlled trial suggests that just\nAdding vitamin D may not be producing the benefits that we expect and there are a bunch of studies that are in process right now so we'll have to wait to see the results but if taking vitamin D\nIt's that we expect and there are a bunch of studies that are in process right now so we'll have to wait to see the results but is taking vitamin D doesn't lead to the outcomes that we would hope for\nWhat does this say about sort of natural process of actually getting sun exposure to boost your vitamin D levels it'll drive the dermatologist crazy but is it possible that the supplements won't live up to expectations\n[noise] um get certainly possible that the ... do we think they might do based on\nBlood levels that more reflect a sunlight exposure\nBut there are major problems were randomized trials when it comes to studying nutrition and ... the supplies to some other areas as well but ah probably first and foremost that when we look at cancer this is a process that developed over many decades\nAnd most randomized trials go on for just three or four or five years\nAnd for looking at cancer cardiovascular disease\nOr that's just a little tiny window in a in a process that goes on for for many decades and it's easily possible that we won't miss some benefits there and I just as one example\nThat uh most of the randomized trials of not showing that vitamin supplements benefits cardiovascular\nDisease but for the physicians health study this was one study that went on for twelve years in a little bit longer for some people there was a significantly lower risk\nOf a total cancer incidence we're taking a multiple vitamin supplements in that study looking in that study for the hit it only going on for eight years so that would not have been seen it was a modest benefit but still [noise]\nBut looking in that study for the hit it only going on for eight years so that would not have been seen was a modest benefit but still an eight or ten percent reduction in total cancer incidence is actually pretty important and I would have been missed in every other study that's been done just simply on the basis of ah not being long enough\nSo I think many of the trials are naive [noise]\nA point of the problems is of course that in many of the trials even by four or five years\nMany people are not no longer taking supplements so you're really not testing the hypothesis that people get tired of it you need a lot of commitment and the physician's self study was people who are really very committed they were physicians in over a long term studies were important and so the the long term study was possible\nAlso there's the issue that when we give a nutritional supplement\nUh it's not like a new drug where the people getting placebo are not getting any of that drug but in the context of a nutritional study of almost everybody's getting some of the nutrient that were testing and so many people\nAlready may have sufficient intake that nutrient and adding more producers are we ... back no benefit if they already have enough\nBut it may be that there's twenty or thirty percent or even ten percent who are not getting enough\nAnd would benefit for more and that would be missed in almost every study that's been done because there's not enough statistical power\nTo pick up a benefits in a even a fairly substantial ... [noise] so all these problems of duration of this study compliance or here instead of taking the supplement\nAnd and the fact that in the background many people are already getting enough of what's being tested all those factors go together to make it really difficult to do is strong studies in giving a supplement a in a randomized trial context\nFactors go together to make it really difficult to do is strong studies in giving a supplement a in a randomized trial context\nDr Willett it's clear that a cancer development is a long term process the development of heart disease can take place over many years osteoporosis is also something that doesn't happen overnight it it builds up gradually\nWe recently like yesterday I think got an email from a woman named Mary who said\nThat she um has been diagnosed with osteoporosis she broke her shoulder and that's what led them to the diagnosis she's Seventy nine years old or vitamin D three level is sixty three she says I'm assuming she actually means her twenty five I dropped C. vitamin D\nAnd she says I Can't take the ... that my doctor has prescribed they just make me sick what can I Do to improve my bones\nWell it's really hard to be specific about any specific guys you're goes situation worse for ... we'd want to know a lot more about a person or that low blood levels that amount of grams per ... is\nPretty good vitamin D level and it's the team's probably unlikely that more vitamin D is going to be beneficial and of course calcium intake is a\nNecessary one would want to know if a person is getting adequate calcium from our diet and if not at a modest supplement might be good or change your diet is another possibility and for going to have some very a lot of evidence suggesting that yogurt is a pretty good for him to get the dairy\nSome of these drugs do have access to the young and can't be tolerated but I think we're in we're really\nSo just thing that yogurt is a pretty good for him to get the dairy\nSome of these drugs do have access to the young and can't be tolerated but I think when we're really need to look at the overall picture about one factor that is absolutely important and comes through in every study is that physical activity helps build up bones and reduce fracture risk it reduces fracture is\nBoth by reducing the risk of falling through improving muscle strength\nAnd also bones respond to the mile stresses of physical activity by essentially getting stronger so the one thing that surely should be part of the package for everybody is to incorporate a physical activity\nAnd that but it's important to remember that it's really stressing the bones\nSo that out walking around or jogging or jumping will help your legs\nAnd help prevent hip fractures but that won't have the upper arms or the upper body and the arms so uh it's important as as we get older to include resistance training\nThat gives a little bit of a workout to all the bones in our body and you can do that with some by rubber band kind of a simple exercises you don't need to even go to a gym to do that but with some but simple strength building as a as lots benefits\nAnd refresh reduction is clearly one of those and often ignored\nYou pointed out that it's important to get enough calcium in your diet and you mentioned the benefits of yoga but what about people who don't tolerate milk even yogurt they may be lactose intolerant perhaps they're allergic\nThere's there's quite a few of them now where else in the diet do they get their calcium\nAnd we'd get calcium through a lot of different foods but for the green leafy vegetables are particularly good source whole grains have a modest amount it with a diet that sports\nDifferent foods but sort of green leafy vegetables are particularly\nGood source whole grains have a modest amount it with a a diet that is what we think is sort of healthy Mediterranean diet with\nWhole grains fruits and vegetables or a a maybe a little bit of cheese or yogurt or if you're a ... if you'd like to us intolerant you are usually tend to have some cheese and modest amounts\nWhich is an option but you can get quite a bit of calcium without any dairy products however if you're concerned a modest calcium does I think it's reasonable ... supplement uh like five hundred milligrams", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Walter Edgar's Journal", "city": "Columbia", "day": "21"}
