R in Wilmington North Carolina is author while they cashed the author of the last ballad which last year was the winner of the southern book prize for literary fiction and so while a welcome to the journal\nThank you so much for having me it's a pleasure to be with you\nWhile at our list is always like to know a little bit about our gas you went to school in Louisiana you live in Wilmington you're on the faculty at UNC Ashville where you from\nOriginally I'm from ... in North Carolina which is where the last ballad the novel that you mentioned in the intro was set\nI was a was raised there and then I went to school or in North Carolina and graduated from public universities here and uh the old nor state and then I left and two thousand three and went to graduate school at the University of Louisiana\nAnd I went down there for two reasons I wanted to go as far into the geographic south as I could and Louisiana felt like the best place to do that\nAnd I wanted to study fiction writing under Ernest Jay gangs who was my literary hero and still is he is my I feel like I'm a direct descendant of his of his power and has the static and his craft and so I really went down there to to sit at his feet and to learn to be a writer\nAnd from there I taught 'em for a few years at a small liberal arts college in West Virginia and my wife took a job practicing here in North Carolina we're both North Carolina natives and we came home to North Carolina and two thousand and fourteen\nAnd UNC Ashville hired me to be a writer and ...\nAnd we came home to North Carolina and two thousand and fourteen\nAnd UNC Ashville hired me to be writer in residence and my first\nSemester there was the fall of two thousand sixteen so it's a bit of a mess I'm I'm back and forth across the state uh several times a month teaching there I'm teaching a night class this fall I'm teaching a fiction writing workshop on Monday evenings but we're living here fulltime in Wilmington and\nJust thankful to be in North Carolina and thankful to be working at a great university and living in a place we love\nThe commute from Wilmington to Asheville hope you got a good book on tape or lots of NPR stations to listen to on them on the way across that\nYet I'm I'm very fortunate that NPR picks up pretty consistently across the entire state of North Carolina so if they can stagger their show times in a way that suits me I Will never hear any repeats but I'm so used to making that drive and I get to pass right through gas stone you and have lunch at my favorite\nLittle places that I miss and so I'm actually looking forward to having some time in the car to clear my head\nAnd those fell out of favor and in the fifties and sixties and I knew that if I wrote a novel like that if I wrote a ... novel that it would be dismissed as being an easy answer novel\nAnd the strike was much more complicated than that it was much more complicated than labor having all the answers and and the ... owners issue in all of the problems and I wanted to write a novel that felt real an actual and in a novel that doesn't have any answers or any easy fixes and it\n[noise] well I'll just say one more thing about grace because you're absolutely right the ideology and to make my bread was was Marxist through and through in fact at one of the ... prize for literature or aspirations [noise] um but you uncovered\nA heroin and\nElla my Wiggins let's talk about her for a minute because her story is I found absolutely fascinating [noise]\nYes so I'm Alone may both in my novel and in real life was born in Nineteen hundred in East Tennessee she was born to a father who was a tenant farmer\nAnd what's happening at the time in the early twentieth century is the cash economy is coming into the Appalachian Mountains people need cash money there\nIs no longer the opportunity to barter\nCentury is the cash economy is coming into the Appalachian Mountains people need cash money there\nIs no longer the opportunity to barter and trade we see stores coming in if you've read Charles Frazier's novel Thirteen Moons the main character starts start owns a store starts working in a store and owns a store store and we see the outset of the cash economy\nAnd so you didn't make a lot of money as a tenant farmer you didn't have access to a lot of cash and so these men and these families moved into the lumber camps because the lumber camps paid cash money and if you've read Ron rashes novel Serino you have an idea of what life was like in the lumber camps and so ... grew up in a lumber camp\nHer father was a ... she and her mother took an laundry they they cleaned the south bend the sweat from the saw your clothes and she fell for a man named John wagons who was a kind of a no good routes about\nAnd he convinced or he listened to these barkers coming up from the Piedmont and from the south Carolina upstate\nAnd he listened to them and he said Ella let's go down to the mills that's where that's where our dreams and our and our hopes are waiting to be met\nAnd so when ... was about sixteen she left the mountains and ended up in ... South Carolina and with John and took a job at her first ... which was the ... manufacturing company\nAnd that's where she gave birth to a few of her her early children and she also worked on a farm down there a work to agriculture on a farm and so she left the mountains as a teenager and she never went back and I I imagine that she always\nRegretted leaving the mountains in the novel I spend a lot of time\nOn her thinking about her decision to leave the mountains and the difficulty she would have never returning wiccan is\nNot the first move talking devil did she fell for [noise]\nYeah she she was she was a tough woman and she had a series of people coming in and out of her life\nTalking devil did she fell for [noise] yeah she she was she was a tough woman and she had a series of people coming in and out of her life that tried to take advantage of her\nAnd I tried to show that the union also in some ways took advantage of her um you know Ella didn't know anything about communism she was widely intelligent a history and research bear that out but she didn't know anything about communism because she'd never had to\nAnd so when she got swept up in this middle strike there was a certain amount of um [noise]\nUh advantage that the organizers were taking taking of her they they chose her because she could sing they chose her because she was firing they chose her because her story was full of tragedy\nThey chose her because she was well spoken and she was interesting and she was funny and they chose her because she was female\nThey also chose her because she lived in an African American neighborhood and worked at an integrated mill she literally checked all the boxes for the American Communist Party and for the local organizers she could speak to women she could perform she was a mother she was a single mother\nAnd her friendships were made up of African American relationships\nAnd so she was kind of the ideal prototype of a strike or who is going to reach the largest possible audience and she was also an outsider she didn't work at Laurie she didn't live and gas stone ya\nShe worked seven miles to the west investment city and so she showed that the message of the strike at Laurie had spread to other mills\nAnd so just as she was taken advantage of by John Wiggins and later by her boyfriend Charlie show and buy milk owners she was also taken advantage of\nBy the organizers the union organizers and she wasn't taking advantage of because she was weak\nOr because she wasn't intelligent she was taking advantage of because she was desperate\nAnd she wasn't taking advantage of because she was weak or because she wasn't intelligent she was taken advantage of because she was desperate\n[noise] that was one thing that comes across very clear when when when the union organized come down here to come down to go down there they don't really understand the south\n[noise] no they don't it takes them a while to catch up uh the the the people in the novel Fred deal that he was a real person he was an organizer for New Bedford Connecticut He had let us strike in Connecticut He had been part of the sex strike he was a young man he was impressionable he was hopeful\nHe was not always as honest or as clear as he should have or could have done\nAnd he didn't quite understand the south he showed up on New Year's day in Nineteen twenty non looking for a meal to organize and the south because he knew that tensions were rising\nHe knew that northern owners had purchased mills Laurie was started by local investors in Nineteen hundred\nAnd it was purchased by Rhode Island company in Nineteen sixteen and northern practices were instituted they built a fence around the mill they instituted a stretch out they made it I'm against the rules to leave during your brakes on the night shift to go home and check on your children\nAnd so these were practices that southern mill workers and people from Appalachia weren't familiar with and they were bucking against these northern middle owners and so the national textile workers' union saw an opportunity to come down an organized southern mills\nAnd when Fred bill came down on New Year's day in Nineteen twenty nine\nHe began sniffing around Charlotte gas stony a a counties to the west counties a little bit farther to the north Lincoln county and Marion and people told him Laurie is the largest ... in the state\nAnd if you can organize Laurie you can organize the entire south and that's why he set his thoughts on ... but he never quite understood it he never understood that these people from apple\nOrganized the entire south and that's why he set his sights on ... but he never quite understood it he never understood that\nThese people from Appalachia were fiercely individualistic\nHe didn't understand that men were not going to march on the picket line without weapons he didn't understand that he didn't understand their refusal to integrate he was from a completely different environment a completely different atmosphere\nBeing from New England and working in the mills there he didn't understand what quite what he was getting into\nYour that's true and and as a female companion so fair uh was was ... was a little bit better but I found yes he did use L M I also\nFelt a lot of times he was just really talking down to her was because she was a woman was because she was southern [noise] em I'm misreading that\nNo I don't think so I think that you know I think that some of these biopsies are implicit especially at the time Nineteen twenty nine it was a rare thing for a single mother to have as many children as she did it was a rare thing for a single mother to be the breadwinner\nIt was a rare thing for a single white woman to live in an African American community and have those people watch her children to have her watch their children\nTo live this way and so I think when Fred bill ... elementary and he saw a twenty eight year old woman who was near death from starvation a woman who had her hands full with children a woman who was working Seventy two hours a week and a cotton meal for nine dollars\nAnd he saw a woman who was at the end of a rope who had nowhere else to turn\nAnd it's not that Fred bill was evil but\nI think that gender bias or certainly played a role in his treatment of her and his belief that she would do certain things in the name of the union or wouldn't do certain things and the name of the union but I think a lot of it was class base\nTreatment of her and his belief that she would do certain things in the name of the union or wouldn't do certain things and the name of the union but I think a lot of it was class based as well he probably had never met someone has pours out on may\nHe had probably never met someone who spoke like ... and she was aware of that law was absolutely aware of of the risk of seeming country of seeming backward of seeming ignorant to these people you know she meets Sophie of love and who is Eighteen years old she's from Pittsburgh she's uh she's an organizer with the party\nAnd Ella is terrified of seeming country in front of this woman who's ten years younger than she is and hasn't lived half the life that allow hasn't hasn't overcome half the challenges that allows but because of her regional identity because of the way she speaks because of the way she was raised with the things she was raised believing\nShe's terrified of appearing backward and so I think a lot of bias comes from region comes from class comes from gender and I think all of those things where it play for a law\n[noise] LA is working in an integrated mental that's one thing that piqued my interest because for example in South Carolina it was illegal for the middle force to be integrated the only place African Americans could work was at the dock unloading caught and ... [noise]\nIt was an illegal in North Carolina um but they were relegated in most mills to doing a machine work to do in custodial work as you said the opening room was a very dangerous place to work that was\nPredominantly or the work of African American males but Ella worked in a milk called American male number two it was an integrated melon best summer city it was owned by two brothers the Goldberg brothers who were Jewish they were ... they fled lot after the Russian invasion\nA revival and she was in the newspapers or photographs were taken and all of a sudden she realized that yes she had become a personality\nYes you know in the novel she decides on her day off to go to this union rally at the lower a strike and she has picked up by two organizers and and route to gas stone yeah one of the organizers an Eighteen year old woman named Sophia blood and the woman I mentioned earlier from Pittsburgh\nAsks Ella how did you end up here in the back of his truck with me going to a union rally and said well it tells her story the story of being born in the mountains of her parents dine meat and John wagons going down to the mills losing her children singing music\nWorking in an integrated mill her wage uh and and Sophia says holy cow you know you've got that story and you can sing you're just two weeks\nWorking in an integrated mill her wage uh and and Sophia says holy cow you know you've got that story and you can sing you're just too we've been waiting for and so that night they convince her at the conclusion of the rally to take the stage and tell her story\nAnd to sing a song she's written on the back of union Lee flipped and that song is ... mothers lament\nAnd it's it's written or to the tune of a ballad that everyone would have been familiar with at that time and that's what other was doing she was taking the ... of popular songs and she was re casting them with her own lyrics because she wanted her to her music to be familiar and she wanted it to be memorable\nAnd her getting up and testifying in singing is akin to religious practices in the south and in Appalachia you get up and you tell your story of walking through the fire how you've come through the act of salvation God moving upon your heart\nAnd then you sing a song or you do something else very emotional\nAnd this is a pattern this is a type of delivery this is a call an ultra call sort support the union give your life to Christ it's kind of the same type of structuring of the message\nThat people in the audience would have been familiar with and the organizers knew that was the ... kind of person to deliver that message\nFred bill couldn't speak the way el uh spoke Sophia bluff and could not speak the way that I spoke Carlton read who's an editor of the the the labor organizing magazine could not speak the way that Alice book they knew that\nThat's where all those power was it was in delivering it was and it was in being in tune with the audience that was in delivering a message that would resonate with them and so this evening when Ella delivers her story and sings a song and make sure the face of the strike and that makes her dangerous to the mills and also in dangerous for life\nDelivers her story and sings a song and makes the face of the strike and that makes her dangerous to the mills and it also in dangerous for life and of course I'm as the reader will learn very early in the novel that decision has a horrifying consequences for Ellen her family that are born out throughout the novel\nThe organizers decided she's no longer be working and bills from a city they're going to pay her her at least her weekly wage I promise her that don't always come through\nThey ask her about joining the union and becoming an organizer after she speaks and she says well I don't know let me get back to best summer city in work my shift and think about it\nAnd the organizers tell her oh you think you're going to go back to work you think they don't know that you're here speaking at this rally you think they don't know you talked about them you think they don't know that you've hung out with a bunch of union organizers that jobs not waiting for you when you go back and had no idea\nThat that was going to be the case and so she feels panicked she feels taken advantage of she feel scared and she feels that she has to make a decision and so she decides to begin organizing for the union they agree to pay her at least her weekly salary to do that\nAnd the union also offers food\nBecause that's that's how they get people to come to the rallies you can come to the union rally and you can get a meal you can have a cup of coffee it may be cold and it may be better but we also have meat we may get you a slice of bologna\nWe may get you a green vegetable and that's something that's missing from many of these people's lives\nAnd Ellis says if I can feed myself\nAnd my children and make some money this is what I'm going to do this is what she decides to do\nAnd she and others actually make a trip to Washington to trust\nDo this is what she decides to do and she and others actually make a trip to Washington to try to deal with North Carolina senator\nAnd that's a true story Ella took part and a group of strikers who went to Washington DC and they attempted to meet with senators who were leading investigations into milk conditions and the south\nAnd it won at one point during that trip during that day they were in Washington they encountered senator Lee ... who was a senator from Salisbury North Carolina a long serving senator he was giving a tour to a group of college women from Greensboro\nThe the teachers school and in Greensboro North Carolina\nAnd so they can front the senator and they demand T investigate and speak to and share his ideas and fix the issues facing children and working mothers and southern textile mills in Hebrew rates the strikers he's he he he accuses them of being in costume\nHe tells a young girl who's fourteen years old that she needs to get back in school\nHe tells them that they're too rough that they're putting on that this these these issues are overblown and here he is with the well coughed\nYou know ... from North Carolina these these college educated women who are horrified at the appearance of the strikers\nAnd Ella steps in front of her group and she says how dare you say these things to us how dare you tell this little girl to go to school she can't afford to go to school all she can afford as the close she has on you have no idea what's going on in North Carolina and it's time you do\nI've always been so struck by the parallel of these women these college educated women encountering this band of of of rough looking desperate strikers and and how would they take a law and so in the novel one of the the the the women being educated at the woman's costs\nLooking desperate strikers and and how would they take a law and so in the novel one of the the the the women being educated at the women's college in Greensboro is the daughter of a no loner and Gaston county and it gives her a lot to think about and she goes back home to to to to McAdams bill can ville Carolina\nAnd gets involved in the strike she and her family get involved in the strike in ways that will hopefully surprised the reader because it's certainly surprises as family [noise]\nThe senator did not leave things are in fact all the government officials in in North Carolina got involved the mayor of gusto near appeal to the governor for help he sent several hundred National Guard troops and they go into the middle village and begin to wreak their vengeance on those who are participating in the strike\nYes or when the strike was organized on April Fool's day April first Nineteen twenty nine\nThe night shift walked out and began protesting and the governor caught in the national guard to quell the protest and incredible violence was done against the strikers primarily women because men refused to march on the picket line without weapons\nAnd the union organizers told them look the police are looking for a reason to shoot you\nIf you have a gun that's reason enough so men refused to march and so when the national guard came in and these clashes broke out between strikers and guardsmen the classes were between women and children and people were injured and no one necessarily gravely but people were seriously injured\nAnd then as the strike we're on the ... decided to evict people from their homes union members were a victim from their homes and so the police were called in to oversee people being moved out of their homes violently their stuff thrown in yards their stuff broken the furniture\nAnd so the police were called in to oversee people being moved out of their homes violently their stuff thrown in yards their stuffed broken the furniture broken their food spoiled and violence occurred once again on the day that the the strikers were affected it was a very very intense summer\nThere was one saying very graphic saying where the boss man goes down to the village to tell her body to shape up they're already going to be shipped out and he can't believe it when he is pelted with rotten vegetables including a cabbage to the face which I thought was a nice touch [noise]\nWas a fun thing to write the demand it comes down to the village was a man named Percy apps he's head of security and Laurie he's also an attorney he's also the man in charge of hiring and I guess what we would now call human resources or a jar\nHe has a history of taking advantage of young women in the ...\nHe has a reputation for cruelty and indifference\nAnd Ella who has only recently joined the union that morning she spoke at a rally the night before and has no ride back to best summer city and spend the night at the union headquarters finds herself in the village while these people are being evicted\nAnd just buy a set of circumstances she finds herself confronting Percy apps and he Caesar and he says I Know who you are I Know where you work and I know your name and I know you were saying last night and I will never forget you and of course he doesn't and\nHe demands all these people disperse who have gathered in the village to stop the evictions to attempt to stop the evictions and they begin to helping him with all of the food that has been thrown out of their homes that morning and all of their broken furniture and they're they're ruined yard implements and things like that and so Percy abs is forced to retreat and that was a ...\nMorning and all of their broken furniture and they're they're ruined yard implements and things like that and so ... is forced to retreat and that was a very satisfying in a very fun scene to write but it was also a scene that I realized that Ella may had gotten herself in deep now she she stared", "show_name": "Walter Edgar's Journal", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "12"}
