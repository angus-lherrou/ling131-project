integrative medicine in Durham North Carolina she's co director of the yoga for seniors teaching training program and co author of relax into yoga for seniors\nHer previous book was yoga sparks one hundred eight easy practices for stress relief in a minute or less Carol in a minute or less how is that possible\n[noise] do if you can breathe you can practice yoga and if you're doing some mindful breathing that takes a minute I'm and there's so many things that that are can be a part of a yoga practice that you might not even recognize for example is\nUm [noise] he let someone in front of you in line you know they're a someone that is a yoga practice that's a a practice of a party ... of letting someone else go first\nUm as I was saying earlier the principals have yoga being content looking at what's right instead of what's wrong\nThese are all part of the yoga practice so this is what I outlined in the books of their pastors breathing meditation and these little principles\nWell the thing that's so interesting to me is that\nDuring the course of the day they're all kinds of little stressors and little interruptions and you're cut off in traffic or you know just all ... you know some political craziness that just happens and the idea of being able to take just a minute\nIn traffic or you know just all ... you know some political craziness that just happens and the idea of being able to take just a minute 'cause we're all in such a hurry to sort of let the stress go through a yoga practice it sounds very appealing even for people who don't want to do pose absolutely\nAnd your example of getting cut off in traffic is a perfect one or\nThirty years ago when I before I was a this deeply into the yoga journey if somebody cut me off in traffic\nMy response might be too for us my hand out the window and make a gesture I I'm embarrassed to say but I was young and foolish and that might have been what I Would do if somebody would cut me off in traffic\nToday if somebody cut me off in traffic I might stop take a breath\nSend that person some love and kindness I mean you don't that person might be rushing to the hospital to care for a sick child you just don't know what their story is and the effect of the difference between thrusting my hand out the window and making a gesture\nAnd taking a breath and sending a prayer for love and kindness can you see the difference in my own physiology\nHuge on yeah and that's a huge huge difference in your reaction which is what you have control over and who knows even if they're just thoughtless jerk they may need loving kindness as well\nAnd when the world be a nicer place if we were all letting other people in line and uh sending people loving kindness instead of road rage\nCarol how did you get interested in teaching yoga for seniors [noise] my journey\nTo teaching yoga for seniors are started in Nineteen Ninety nine I enrolled in a yoga teacher training program it was a two year seven hundred our ...\nStarted in Nineteen Ninety nine I enrolled in yoga teacher training program it was a two year seven hundred our program a and it's part of that program we had to do some community service we had to do twelve hours of community service\nAnd for my community service I volunteered teaching yoga at the ... medical center when my husband is a cardiologist at Duke and I knew some folks there and they were very happy for me to volunteer there\nAnd this group was called um ... it was a gerontology rehabilitation program so they were mostly men because they were veterans there were some women in their sixties seventies eighties they had had heart attacks they had COPD that had diabetes these were\nPeople dealing with some serious health challenges and I walked in you know as a newly minted teacher looking at this group of\nOlder men and I thought oh my God I'm\nScared to death I'm going to kill them I Can't teach these guys ... what am I going to do [noise]\nSo I observe their calisthenics they did as part of they did a aerobics and they did weight training in this part of that\nUm calisthenics they got on all fours and they did something they called ... and slump ... Ben slump and the light whoa home [laughter] that's what they call that I've I've got to say they were on their hands and knees and they were arch their back up that was ... and then they would make their spine curved down that was the slump\nAnd as a yoga practitioner and newly minted yoga teacher I realize well in yoga we call that cat cow and if they were doing that anyway if I taught at taught it to them I probably wouldn't kill them so I I saw that many of the things they were doing in their calisthenic program were\nActually based on yoga practice it so I took those than I knew they were already doing and I added the breathing\nCalisthenics program were actually based on yoga practice so I took those than I knew they were already doing\nAnd I added the breathing and I added the awareness and instead of volunteering there for twelve years for twelve sorry for twelve weeks I volunteered there for five years because it was really transformative they\nWere so appreciative they would come back to me and they would say my doctor says I'm doing so well whatever I'm doing I I I I should keep it up um and it was it was really amazing and one of the things that I discovered um in teaching veterans\nWas that it's not just what you do and yoga it's how you do it that really matters and because these guys were were soldiers they are soldiers athletes in our culture tend to disconnect there minding their body they have to\nYou would never break a block in in uh in karate if you were really thinking about how it might hurt you really have to kind of disconnect\nOr to do a marathon you really have to just sort of not um disconnect to a certain extent so some of these guys really didn't know how they felt and\nI look at someone who would be read in the face doing opposing nice how are you are you okay yes ma'am they had no clue so teaching them how to challenge themselves but not to strain\nTeaching themselves to back off a little that was huge oh that's great we go to the phones in Binghamton New York Virginia would\nLike to tell us about practicing yoga as an older adult Virginia please tell us your story high\nTemperatures you ...\nI think you'll find as soon as I Walk out of ...\nShe\nHi thanks for your wasn't find just about a moment ... she sort of like Google guy the but she was forty nine now\nAnd you say Ninety nine yes she's the world's oldest

outcomes one is good posture I'm Still five foot seven to hide I achieved in high school\nThe other is that my balance is very good I've had some close calls on steps and I've always been able to instantly correct and finally the meditation techniques I've learned have curb my anxiety many times and here's the best part and I think all caps yoga feels good\nHaitian techniques I've learned have curb my anxiety many times and here's the best part and I think all caps yoga feels good [laughter]\nThat's wonderful and you know the the reason that people come back to doing something is because they enjoy it so to me that's that's a part of the reason why we do yoga\nIs because it feels good we can be friend our bodies we can enjoy a having these bodies\nHe's vehicles for our spirits\nThat's great ah we go to Dallas texas Charles welcome to the people's pharmacy\nHi thank you very much I'm I'm really interested in your program are started yoga when I was sixty two\nBecause I was having a substantial problems in my cup of walking and sitting and Irish Tiffany up and my back couldn't even touch my knees and at the suggestion of a part of a of a doctor\nHe said if you don't start doing some video stiff stiff enough that he showed try yoga and I've been going here every\nDay for six days a week sounds and it's been unbelievable so are you able to walk\nWithout pain\nNot only can I Walk without paying I could Merrill do jumping jacks that I haven't done since high school\nOh that is good when I was down ... we we really do appreciate it Carol I'm wow\nWell that's that's a wonderful testimonial and are not just to you but also to your yoga teacher that is wonderful to to know that you found someone who um is clearly a very good teacher and we [noise]\nYou're yoga teacher that is wonderful to to know that you found someone who um is clearly a very good teacher\nAnd we had a physician recommending yoga which is kinda cool 'cause I think a lot of times\nWe get into the motive thank you all will doctors are going to recommend medications non steroid or anti inflammatory drugs or perhaps recommend an orthopedic surgeon who do me a hip replacement her knee replacement so here's a position to say hey let's try yoga first and it worked\nAnd that is that is great and\nPart of the the reason why there's such a a moving the yoga community\nTo research the effect is because it will result in physicians making these referrals and because back pain is an area that there's very strong evidence of efficacy of physicians are referring people to yoga which is great\n[noise] we actually have an uh an email from Mary Kaye who wants to compare tai chi and yoga for seniors\nThere are many similarities in yoga tai chi both are or what would be called a mind body activity in that I'm with tai chi and with yoga you cannot be watching television and do tai chi or do yoga\nOr you might be doing tai chi moves and yoga moves while you're watching TV a bite you are you're not doing the practice so you have to be completely involved with what you're doing it has to be very present in both tai chi and in yoga tai chi is a very slow um\nMartial art where you're um you're staying very present you shift your weight from one side to the other so tai chi is often a recommended for older adults it's done and I'm Asian communities um and there's good advocacy for tai chi and balance one of that\nA recommended for older adults it's done and I'm Asian communities um and there's good advocacy for tai chi and balance one of the biggest differences with yoga and tai chi is tai chi as far as I'm aware as always done standing\nWhereas yoga you're in many planes of action if people can get down and up from the floor\nThey can lie down and if they can't get down enough from the floor you can do yoga in your bad but you can do yoga prone so their movements that are done prone and soup on\nA there are also inverted movements so if you're physically able to be upside down you could do a hand standing yoga I'm not sure that there are any inverted movements and tai chi so that's a little bit of the the difference the planes of action\nOkay well we go to Ira, Texas Gail welcome to the people's pharmacy\nHi I'm\nSo happy to talk Carol I took your training back at Duke and number of years ago that led to say Hi to [laughter]\nThat since that time I was open to yoga studio in\nThis small farming community almost on the Oklahoma border and I have people coming from great distances because there's not a lot of yoga around here\nBut it's so good to hear your voice again and I wanted to know that your methods and your book are being shared with my classes I Do a chair yoga class twice a week and I've got a lady in there that's eighty four\nBut the very best part of my yoga classes they all say is the ... where they can just shut everything out let their bodies come to quiet and get some time just to themselves and I owe that to you so\nMuch for sharing that story for those of our listeners you don't quite know what you mean when you say cheer yoga can you explain\nWell we do a lot of the poses from the chair we're sitting down and we can do a lot of upper body where we stretched\nCan you explain\nWell we do a lot of the ... from the chair\nWe're sitting down we can do a lot of upper body where we stretch our orange and Nixon round airbags like a cat cow we use the chair also to get down to the floor and there was a specific way that I was taught their due to stand with your hands and that little finger on the place where the legs attach\nAnd we practice that in standing\nThey use the chair as they get down to the floor foot one day down and and the other day on and I have one person who's now deceased and I taught them that her that that if they ever fell in their house to get to a place where they can pull themselves up and I was told that that he did that and and was able to do that before she passed and so it\nIt helps throughout the lives that that we have left\nAnd inquiring minds women do ... do you have any farmers in the farming community doing yoga\n[laughter] that was not good because\nI Do have a I have per person down the road from me his name is Mike He has had a valve replacement and he came to yoga of course with the encouragement of his life and they both did yoga for a while he's now in cardiac rehab and has said that you know he'll come back to yoga when he\nCan he's he's involved in that right now and even my husband who was a farmer did classes when Mike was coming but you're right it's more women I'm encouraging men uh because my husband is also a golfer and it helps with his shoulders and back when he gets a little bit stiffed um golf\nGail thanks so much for your call it was a delightful to hear from you Gail and I'm so appreciative to hear that the techniques that we've been teaching\nAt Duke are making their way out into the world because what my experience has been I'm working with older adults\n... at Duke are making their way a out into the world because what my experience has been I'm working with older adults in people with health challenges is hearing\nFar too many times from people who say oh I went to a yoga class my doctor said I should go to yoga class so I went to this gym or this why or something and I I got hurt and the reality is that um [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Walter Edgar's Journal", "city": "Columbia", "day": "14"}
