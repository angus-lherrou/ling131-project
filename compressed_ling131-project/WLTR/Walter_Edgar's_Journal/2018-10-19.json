I'm really glad that I was asked to interview all these people\nInstead of getting everything from bill because bill wasn't going to tell me about all those cute little girl in Georgetown who went and got guy when this handsome tall new man teacher and coach came to Georgetown so to get that perspective\nFrom people who've grown up but still remembered the effect he had on them was um what's fun for me\nSo I clearly we know you're with this era you have you have the background material so did you work with Bill at any point or two just after you read the manuscript then due to the introduction of conclusion\nJonathan sent me the manuscript up and I decided what I wanted to do using my um journalistic skills from years of being a state newspaper I decided that I wanted to be able to take me to his hometown of Newberry\nAnd said we did that we spent the day and that became the the beginning and the end of\nThe story his birthplace so bill where we're back to something now and uh I have a question did this to some ... come into existence while you were there are we is and that's an interesting story yesterday did\nAs long as you went on earlier and ... and who wouldn't Lincoln and we worked diligently on curriculum textbook adoption\nIt went on earlier and earlier on who was over Lincoln and we had worked diligently own curriculum and textbook adoption and bringing parents than [noise]\nBut at the end toward the end of the year we knew that the community was interested in what's the name of the new school what are going to be the call us and what they're going to be the mascot ... is our new ... actually a new school being built no no no that's another that's another story we just had these two buildings so but we didn't know\nWhat to do with these three questions\nEt cetera you get your student council which we all black over Lincoln and put them in your library we bust the white student council oh what a Lincoln [noise]\nThis is the first time these two student council label met together and we took them down early myself with a and I said we're going to come together next year as one school and Dr von and myself have a problem we don't know what to name the school we don't know what the caller was what the mascots would be so we need your help\nWe don't want anybody to feel like they're left out we want everybody to feel like they're part of this new school so you need to help us with the name of the school was closed and the mascot and we turned around walked out\nAnd those two student council met together\nTo this day I Do not know who took over I think I Do but I was never told and they came up to student councils with the name of ... high school\nWhich does away with the name of Edmunds and the Lincoln and since general Sumpter was well known as the game come out in the revolutionary war that would be the mascot that also happen to be the mascot Edmunds\nTheir decision was to name the school's Sumpter as a mascot\nGame cook and use the colors from Lincoln\nTheir decision was to name the school's Sumpter as a mascot game cook and use the colors from Lincoln\nA great compromise now we knew early myself me if we ... that the decision that these two student council said me to this school board\nDid they would think it was our decision so we took the two student council presidents and let them make the decision to scoop we'll see what we knew at that time we couldn't take some of the things we wanted to do to the school board and the eggs and expect them to approval\nSee all of the school board were graduates of Edmunds hospital all white student who knew where they were going to come from so we kind of\nOn to cut the school board it took things from the bottom of Mr from the top down and the school board ball they well they almost had to they didn't want to you could tell because I I I went with those two kids to make the presentation but see they knew that time there were eighty kids on the street\nWho said we made the decision this is what is going to be sort of had would create an awful lot of turmoil and but coming from the kids it uh it helps to settle things a little bit\nWell I think Sally and ... through their work will tell you this whole idea of\nWhat to call the school the school colors and the mascot for\nIssues across South Carolina and they were handled differently in\nDifferent districts sometimes it went very well some type of dead and in Spartanburg because my student ... was there at the time the students decided on what they would like to have happened but as you later experienced in your county the school board wasn't going to buy and what to do with the school\nThey would like to have happened but as you later experienced and your county the school board wasn't going to buy and what to do with the school\nAfter their Sumpter high school Lincoln became a junior high what what\nWe what we had to do because of the restrictions of facilities we had to do to build didn't eleventh and twelfth grade would be on the Edmund ... campus\nAnd the ninth and tenth grades would be only the Lincoln campus they would all be stumped the high school and the words into plans at that time a new school building in the future it would come up in a couple of years but we would we will mandated to integrate and that was the way we plan to do it will not deal with the best we had\nSo the plan is a mouse to the community what his reaction in terms of is this the beginning of white flight from the ... schools\nOh no the the white flight started before that as soon as people in the early sixties knew that they were going to have to go to school with black kids\nLittle profit academies began to show up all over all over and they they exploded than in the late sixties early seventies but they had been done before that time\nBut you still had a large white student population at Sumpter huh oh yeah oh yeah yeah and yeah that ... that merged year was actually a golden year one of your former students called a Camelot well\nNow that was during the year of the the process of immigration see you've got to come back to the graduation exercises that year that or was there which exploded everything that we had attempted to do in a peaceful way\nSee a ... I Believe there's a lot of people did that you needed to rehearse for graduation\nSo on the day before graduation he took all\nThere's a lot of people did that you needed to rehearse for graduation\nSo on the day before graduation he took all the students all the senior class had set up the stadium just like it would be on graduation night\nAnd uh we went through you know go through and shaking hands with this person that person and all of a sudden he comes back to the microphone\nAnd says sit down just a minute\nI Need to tell you that I Am a representative of the state of South Carolina and for you to get a high school diploma you more shake hands with the superintendent\nAnd some of you people in rehearsal and have not shaken hands with me and he sent Fred wells who was this system soup and turn it back to the office while all over the rest of us sitting out in the hot sun to get the code of laws of South Carolina\nAnd they go and they come back and they stood over there to the side and they leaf through the book\nAnd they spent Fifteen minutes trying to find this little segment\nAnd finally came back said we can't find it right now but it is mandated that you most shake hands with the superintendent\nAnd your kids who have not shaken hands with we need to go with Dr death to his office and signed a statement that you will shake hands with me tomorrow night for you to be able to get your diploma\nNow here there's an interesting point one of the kids who did not shake hands with Michael area\nAnd Michael here it might be the hero of this whole thing he stood his ground at the first meeting as I mentioned before way of ... I had called reach them on and Ethel Burnett myself together to sit down and plan for the year\nHe told us that it was one student who was a problem Waco now heads the superintendent\nSit down and plan for the year he told us it would one student who was a problem Waco now heads the superintendent\nWho is the superintendent him through four thousand kids than one kid is just drove me and that kid is Michael area\nWell observe Michael here during the year an Michael here was high strong he was very intelligent he was he took up for himself and this was a little different from what older white men were expecting from black kids he did nothing that was bad he just was independent\nI I think Sally can can jump in here and talk about what older white folks expected black children to ... how they expected them to behave in at this time\nWell they certainly expected black children ... and you know black children were not on the same level as white children and they were certainly expecting to be somewhat a reverential would that\nThat would be the right work are are certainly deference to rent the actors that and the place ads ... in the\nPlace was the ... bottom light man right they they expected blacks to stay in the place and the place was defined by the white man that's that's\nTruly it okay so we've we've got this young black kid who was a pretty good basketball player yes he was he was chosen as a U.S Senate basketball player that year that year oh\nRead so it said you probably need to meet the agriculture teacher who had been in that district for thirty five years and you people who are not in public education need to know during that time and I were talking about the fifties sixties seventies\nAgriculture to just particularly small community has had an inordinate amount of power because they had all those resourceful federal money coming in to help the farmers in the march of two fold farm machinery they really behind\nThe scenes were very very powerful a lot of people who became superintendents during those these tricked into more rural districts were former agriculture teachers so ... says you probably\nTen minutes during those days checked into more rural districts or former Arab culture teaches\nSo Reed says you probably need to ... meet for Johnson who's been with us and he knew if Phillip Johnson had an inordinate amount of power of what went on a quiet and behind the scenes not out front not on any bullets or anything like that\nDuring that first year I brought all the ... the administrative staff of that district to Columbia\nTo meet with them and kind of see how we will go on to integrate schools in New York you know just kind of get together and let's see how we want to do this and you've got three high schools you're dealing with yeah we had hickory grove which was way out in the western part of your county very rural\nAnd then we had a Jeffs in which was the black school and your costs school so we had and I don't want it to integrate but we had to consolidate you know his consolidation when you close the schools completely and bring 'em into another school so we're working with consolidation and integration\nAt that meeting we had to kind of plan for the thing to a floor Johnson says yo dog we've probably been don't need to push that right now\nAnd it should have been a red flag owning your own\nDoing something to be successful in grade school and you don't need to do that right now\nAnd we found that to be the problem and it was a problem up there with the old white school board\nWhite man on the school board but no females they wouldn't know blacks or there was no spokesman for the other side so we had to work through we had that he could grow group have a great group to work with us that's the consolidated school they will read it to come together\nHad to work through we had that he could grow group have a great group to work with us that's the consolidated school they will ... come together\nWhat we decided to do in your book was since we didn't get kids to do it we had every one of the most greatest throughout the district the named one teacher in their in their own staff\nWho had been there a long time who got along great with the community who to kids liked named that one person in your school and we brought them together\nTo to help us with integrating schools\nThey said we go off and decide on the colors and mascots and things would you all support us\nAnd everybody in the group said they would accept\nThe principal at your school white man who has a buddy of slower Johnson agriculture teacher he said I don't know what you're going to come back we're so I'm not going to commit to supply and here we were sitting in a group of professional people\nDon't help us make a decision we send them to hit ... county ... got them away from got um a wave away from and we brought in some people from from the University of South Carolina to beat the moderate has\nNone of us went with them we only people who went from your were those teachers who are ... by their principal\nOr with people from the university they came back with a great resolution\nNow we're dealing with Hitler grove Jefferson and you'll they said let's do away with the names of each of those schools in color your comprehensive high school we will be the coolest that was neat to hit the road just an all you all and we'll have the colors of black and silver\nOr Oakland Raiders calling us [noise]\nSome all you all and we'll have the colors of black and silver\nOr Oakland Raiders calling us\nWhich did away with all the calls at ... grew grow all the colors that Lincoln at Jefferson all the call and say you'll ... and they all your Green Dragons here we come with the Green Dragons during the Paolo it was in New York and it was all white\nAnd the Green Dragons we're not going to do away with Green Dragons [noise]\nSo ... in in one lane helped me decide to leave their you know what the board decided when they when those teachers came back with that decision is and we don't know what we're going to we'll start it and they spent months going back and forth yeah we'll do it no we won't yeah we'll do it\nBut they couldn't get away from the Green Dragons that that power in the in the community\nSo they said what we'll do\nSince your cause great football\nDuring football season will be the green and white dragons\nDuring basketball season who will be blue and white bulldogs that was the old ... officer and baseball and during the baseball season we'll have to greet a red and white which were the cardinals of it grew grow\nThey were sending those kids to school and that is that the truth is sort of first year that will be green and white the middle of the year there will be blue and white and the end of the year there'd be red and white I said\nHeck no hey I'm not going to live through this so I'm getting now interesting part of this to let you know how important football is under state of South Carolina some years later they were looking for a new football coach to come to New York\nAnd he was coming in as the athletic director and football coach and he's meeting with the board and he tells them\nAnd he was coming in as the athletic director and football coach\nAnd he's meeting with the board and he tells them I'm not coming into this type of setting you going to have to settle on one thing what did they do at that time just to six years later after these professional educate us had gone off and made this recommendation\nThey went back and now the ... and the yellow and black you all conference at some hospital\nJust tells you a little bit about Powell football in agriculture teaches [laughter] and and wide school boards [laughter]\nI just wanted to know how many agricultural teachers are still left in the schools because the trades have disappeared yes and the thirty years since then it's it's a big difference even in the rural districts\nThat's an interesting point they wanted him to wait out at that time\nAnd just for the last grass Powell they own way up\nYeah okay well I've got a job for ... yeah\nI Would like Sally to read a document that was uncovered and the Newbury college archives and it was a letter that Pat Conroy wrote to you it literally was not discovered until twenty sixteen and I know because the arc of is\nTracy power with one of my former students and he got a very excited about finding this letter and Sally\nIf you would read I I think it's appropriate for somebody to ... do you read it yourself because you're the recipient\nYour doc the kid you want shopped around the St Paul locker room for ten minutes has managed to live down his nefarious past or maker beginnings he is now cruising on the GNC having\nSt Paul locker room for ten minutes has managed to live down his nefarious past or maker beginnings he is now cruising on a GMC having just slept create on route to Beirut, Lebanon I've been doing a lot of thinking on this cruise and it seems whenever I think of you\nLooms as an important figure presiding over and in some unfathomable way guiding interacting whatever decision I make [noise]\nSo it has been for five years so it is now for three years now I have wondered about my position and the great scheme of things this year it became almost agony the thought of gradual deterioration of age of death of everything significant demand during his tenure on earth\nI have met three interesting people on the journey they are intelligent older and they are still asking the same questions I Am now asking myself\nI don't know if I ever will be content with what I'm doing but I Wonder now if anything but the human oxen of the world ever are\nEverything I have done since leaving the effort has been a reflection of the summer I spent with few digging those damned ditches and paying those damn bookcases I have never understood the dynamics of hero worship maybe it was the discovery of the father I never had as a youth and finally found in you\nA father that was not only stern but was tender a father a book the storm and the sun all these things come now before me doc all these things in a mixture of joy and sorrow\nThe realization of days last memories vanished delicious moment carried and discarded by divergent wins\nIt is important for you to notice affect you had had and I believe you know it but in the short in this horrible brevity of like I Want to get everything said\nTo know this effect you have had and I believe you know it but in the shortness and horrible brevity of like I Want to get everything said everything someday I Will exert the same influence over someone and I want him to
