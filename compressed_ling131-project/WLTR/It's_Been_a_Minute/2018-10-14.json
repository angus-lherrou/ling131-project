parents don't want to in my head said don't do just dumped the hearts and crap do it anyway\nTo it and so I said send it Patty please just said that 'cause my heart one that one and she sent it\nAnd I waited on pins and needles probably for the first week and kept on just badgering poor Patty well they just said yeah yeah I said we can send another one okay she send another one finally\nMy email had had a mail from Kelly [noise] and I responded and a\nKid I must have I must have wrote the words so carefully like I was writing a song or something 'cause I just\nI just wanted to be\nThe best I could be [noise] for some reason I just wanted to\nBe the best I could be in that email and um\nBut I never felt I had ever been before it was just to drive in my heart and uh she called me up we talked went to dinner and we were inseparable we're just inseparable after that and she had already been fighting for her life for for three years at that point\nBut she looked amazing you would never know she was so classy so beautiful and and uh we were together for another year and a half I mean we were just inseparable and that I've finally lost her um and uh\nBut about three or four months before I lost her my favorite time we used to spend together was when we would [noise]\nBut about three four months before I lost her my favorite time we used to spend together was when we would go talk each other to sleep you know ... one night she says a\nFunny I Need to ask you a favor us what's that ... would you make me a promise ... what's that\nWell if something were to ever happen to me made me just one problem is that you would not go back into isolation for I just got a feeling it wouldn't make this all for not and I'm telling you those words make this off or not was the biggest arc of\nA a perspective of someone looking at her entire life and try to farm purpose that should she not make it there's got to be a purpose [noise]\nSo I made the problem is that I Would I Would keep that promise and so the music that finally got written and recorded which started about four four or five years ago I started writing about three years ago or so we started recording it off and on you know just randomly\nIs keeping that promise and I'm Talking to you right now is part of keeping the problem is [noise]\nWell I'm so sorry for your loss and and thank you for for sharing that story I thought that that element dedicated to take Kelly and um and that is that Kelly that's really powerful\nOn ... you know she she gave me so much she gave me\nA guy like me really knows someone lost them how would I really know what do you mean how would I honestly tell ya know well when you're sitting in front of a beautiful woman who's got better things to do than waste your time and looks at you\nWell when you're sitting in front of a beautiful woman who's got better things to do go to waste your time and looks at you and says she loves you\n\nAnd you have to feel that because it's pretty evident that she has better things to do that\nTo waste her as much time I have to feel it I have to leave it and I must say that was the first time ever that I felt locked\nSteve Perry\nRight up to listen to a love song from his new album traces that I think speaks to the way Steve is fulfilling the promise that he made to Kelly this one called no more crime\nGo home\nIt to them in\n\n...\nYou do not\nNo more crying off the Perry's new solo album traces coming up I Will talk to Steve about his relationship to his own voice and yes we will talk about\nThere's a there's a call out that you deliver on your new album ... says I guess to um to that idea of of generations and continuing and carrying on this like rock and roll legacy from each other I think that he both at the song um we're still here\nAnd that had left he told me a little bit about that the story that you're telling on on this on ...\nRandy Jackson was working on a project with a writer named Brian west and and he had a writing room at the tenth floor of a building on Hollywood and vine and so we're coming up with a sketch ideas of love to work with us guys from term so we came up with this guy tried to me and Brian\nAnd ah [noise]\nWe took a break went to dinner and as we're going to dinner\nI see all these kids man I mean Fifteen maybe sixteen Seventeen\nI had been gone for a while I not written music for a long time and I realize gosh you know through these kids were still here doing the same thing to do it nothing changes it's still the same amount of kind of morphed into the idea of being on stage and\nTo do it nothing changes it's still the same kind of morphed into the idea of\nBeing on stage and singing we're still here together and it's just kind of grows and talks about both sides of that\nUm under the lights we reclaim this town no one can take his doubt no doubt tonight you know yeah city boys in city girls running wild ... it's just it's what we all do it's the rites of passage\nAnd I just thought there was something of clues to\nBeing part of\nIt all through that again\n... let's hear this on as well we're still here [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAnd we're still here by the Perry is my guest here on the world cafe is new album is called traces we talked earlier about this sort of need that that that you had noticed that you felt as yourself a\nIn yourself as an artist in the early days for for\nApproval I guess in for the love of fans not only to get you there emotionally but it sounds like also to for for a sense of validation which is something that I Would imagine\nGoes along with artistry for for almost everybody at this point I'm In your life and career what are you hoping to get out of the relationship that you have with your fans giving them new music\n[noise] such a beautiful question because our our treat their support and kindness and love for my portion of the music to Rio\nI treat their support and kindness and and love for my portion of the music that we all made together and and the music that I'm making now on traces with was so much reverence meaning\nI only wish them too emotionally connect to what I'm saying the fans profoundly changed my life ah\nThey started loving me when I couldn't love myself you know I I I was a performer a I don't think anybody performs because they don't need to be loved to now [noise] um and so we perform for approval you know you're basically saying\nPlease take me you know [laughter]\nI Want you to please dig may cause I'm I've got something I Want to saying I Want to say and I and I just want you to connect with it you know [noise] but music I mean it [noise] you know if you think about music just for a second\nThis is a marvelous thing music right now in your own mind if you think about one of your favorite song Italia British just tell me what's your favorite song that you remember when you were younger what are your favorite song she told me the title I'm\nOh I'm going to say on Paris Nineteen Nineteen okay yeah now I Want you to sit quiet for one second okay and I want you to play that song in your mind just for a second and then you tell me when you've heard a little bit of it\nThat it did you hear that you can hear right mhm\nHow do you do that tell you how do you do that I have I don't think science really knows how we stream music on her mind and we can stream it over the Internet we can stream it through satellites\nDo that I have I don't think science really knows how we stream music on her mind and we can stream it over the Internet can stream it through satellites but I can sit here\nAnd I can hear my favorite Sam Cooke song anytime I Want to without batteries [laughter] you know I I mean so there's something magical about music and and where it lands and us and how it stays at us\nAnd and we we we own it somehow it becomes part of us and\nI treat dealt with extreme reverence I really do I think it's a magical thing\nOh so do I think you for that ... that's such a beautiful moment there you have created\nI'm Steve I have to we we just have a couple more minutes together and I have to ask you was before\nWe go on in term in I guess in terms of what you've just said being able to evoke a song in one's mind there isn't there is nobody who's listening to music over the last couple of decades or even been to a bar or a wedding\nOr seen the Sopranos or seen the film monster or watch glee that can't conjure up don't stop believe in in in their minds\nAnd and I just have to ask you I guess what what space that holds in in your heart that you are the voice of of the moment in pop culture that that has had this radical resurgence of few decades later and probably will last forever\n[noise] wow\nHow does that make me feel is a tough one um it's probably", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "14"}
