[noise] that's my name I didn't choose it my parents gave it to me um what about you\nDoes your name ... who you feel like you are and if not would you change your name\nAnd what would that mean like yesterday has asked herself all of those questions\nA couple of times she was born and we use that let you ca and branch\nIn her early twenties after a bad break up she moved to London where a fascinating experience inspired her to choose a new name for herself\nChristine and the queens [noise] I don't want to ruin the story of how that happened exactly you will hear her tell it in just a minute Christian and the queen debut album came out in French in twenty fourteen and then it was released an English was edgy exciting and not only did the music make a big impression that the person the artist me to begin\nIt was released in English was edgy it was exciting and not only did the music make a big impression but the person the artist made a big impression she landed on the cover of time magazine as one of ten leaders of the next generation and on BBC list of one hundred most influential women of twenty sixteen\nChristine into queens follow up album is called Chris and it represents another change another chosen identity if you will and just like her debut album was produced by the artist herself here we go\nSo you have such an interesting story and there's so much uh to to talk about together but I don't want anyone to miss understand or miss the fact first that you produced\nThis new album credits at as you did with ... a do it again no problem yeah it sounds so tremendous so I think it's really important to talk about that a little bit first um we're going to play the song five dollars can you just tell me a little bit about what you're recording process for this song was like\nSure and the and thank you for asking actually because it's a pleasure to talk about production for a second um well I remember writing five donors because out of intense listening sessions of Bruce Springsteen [laughter]\nWe don't know if it's a yeah I don't know if it's obvious actually but\nI was kind of like obsessed we've done how ... um sometimes Bruce Springsteen's mental does all the it's it's such a great way to do storytelling and to still be really multi can catchy I think there is a simplicity also in the middle of Bruce Bruce Springsteen the kind of appealing so I think I just try to address\nSpa business as a way to be bad ass I don't know if it means anything but\nAnd also like then again baselines I'm kind of obsessed with baseline so I remember like the baseline for five dollars thinking of that great truck of\nI'm a son and then\nAll the na na\nSo I remember like I Will debate signed for five dollars thinking of that great track of and a son and then saw none\nYeah so that's where my kid who am I can I remembered that production having a great round the sound of a baseline I kind of caught in spite but also yeah\nI Do hear that I Do hear what you described about Bruce Springsteen like how ... can be a tool for for strength and for build 'em and I also want to ask you before we hear the song and and everything that you've just just talked about about the lyric five\nCriticism natural way to reaffirm that power also like it and that and that will be free and I also had to slightly indicate that there was something changing because in four years between my ... and and the one that when I was writing with Chris\nI'm well first I got older I was a woman so I got\nIntroduced to more confidence I'm a different way of all sorts of experiments and living my desires and I think Chris as an album is way more about that about ... about living desire as a force of chaos in about a reveling in that chaos and and so\nIt was quite evident to me that I Would have to be called crispy which is basically the nickname and and the and the really simple expression of cuisine and the queen so it's like the memory of cuisine and the queens but in a different um it's a ration\nOne of the things that you explore really um or one of the ways that you play with that identity really comes through in the first song that we heard on the record on girlfriend\nUm where you talked about exploring ideas of masculinity and and and what it would be to take on a super macho identity um so what did you learn by by going there\nSo tapping into a more masculine macho culture I kind of got in touch with my femininity actually but differently because my my trickle trees also like the pride of the of the budget you know and and showing it off masculinity has always\nBeen also like um a relationship too theatrical you'd see two or nation to construction ... and and the same way I mean it is you know so I'm just trying to play for diffuse it from the inside also like I'm giving hints that it's kind of\nIt's just a game and and I get to play with ...\nTo play for you to use it from the inside also like I'm giving hints that it's kind of it's just a game and and I get to play we've we've read the way I Want it's also about\nOwning your narrative again I mean I'm I feel like I feel like actually I'm a I'm being more empowered as a woman on the record than the first one the first one that had been another interesting relationship to gender and trying to escape gender through becoming more like a an abstract\nEnergy I was wearing like suits to try to cancel the information of gender um and I was trying to escape the male gaze but\nThis time around with cruise some kind of a new I ... the male gaze is that you can't even by being a female former you in the male gaze whether you wanted to know so I'm just trying to disrupt a different city ... well uh let's listen let's listen to the song that we're talking about what's his girlfriend okay\n... yeah ...\n\n\nI think the ...\nThey scan Sean Penn\nWithin that I'm Still get that\nMainly getting in the\nTime as a Muslim some\nLittle ...\nGirl come thirty day on the\nThing is that you're gonna\nBeen goes some but you\n'em like bull I happened to my family\nYou're breathing in all of this thing\nMind we end up\nYou may have been much better oh\n...\nStill doing away with it and then\nIt's me you\nThat girlfriend featuring down funk by Christine the queen's off the new album called Chris more of our conversation is just around the corner will talk about why Chris identified a pen sexual and she'll be a really thoughtful explanation of what that means that's coming up on World Cafe\nHey we'll come back to conversations from the world cafe I'm Talia ... are diving back into our session with Christine and the queens whose new album came out last month it's called Chris\nJust a moment ago hopefully you heard the song girlfriend featuring damn funk from ... new album Chris had described it\nAs a way to explore her macho side and maybe to also point out the feminine aspect of being macho and I had another question about that song so here we go\nBuy a lot of accounts Chris the perspective that you sing about\nOn that song is is sort of one that's on the fringe like there are people who would say that that's on the fringe I'm ... and it seems like being interested in stories on the fringe and really to outsiders even the way that you um talked about being embraced by the the drag queens who first inspired the transformation that you had in your in your early twenties\nUm domestic thing do you feel like an an outsider\n[noise] yes my\nI assure you it's not a poster it's just something that\nYes I feel like I'm In no way am I Will never streets and I think treating like an outside noise if you have this really [noise] um elementary gut feeling of ...\nAnd even like in ... territory like I I used to do a ... during the first two I made I was actually like I'm at some point I was singing a song Weibo flower bouquet and I was like well I I took like two beautiful flowers and I would like to see if we are not as just beyond see\nAnd then I took like I don't know how to say like yeah you know in in ... curves right oh yeah just like in ... the flowers but then what do you like flowers themselves right like the green and lush greenery yeah yeah regular bring ...\nYou know in the ... like hurts right oh yeah just like in ... the flowers but they don't really like flowers themselves right like the green and lush greenery yeah a a regular bring green green studying yeah yeah yeah\nAnd that was like this is actually me and it was just a way to demonstrate that how I felt full so as a ... like I Will say also that I'm I'm pop music Swedish cousin like I'm I'm I'm at the table but I'm just to be a cousin [laughter] so I'm like can you pass me the salt but still you know\nSometimes you can feel like an outsider we're without really being one it's ... minutes maybe just ... you remembering being an outside the ones you know and there was also actually on the album on my new album\nA song called what to say oh that's exactly what they want us to talk about yeah OK well and then he good go yeah sorry yeah free but you kind of address is this idea of the permanence of the wound\nAnd the the idea that ... always one you know even if at some point you're getting power than you belong for some reason we are you ... you find a way to mend your narrative [noise]\nThe wound of feeling um one's tightly cast it out cast out and and nobody and rejected I think it ... it will forever linger kind of never ... actually wakes up and told me I Do love the experience of the wound waking up regularly\nDa\n\nFrom the new album Chris that is doesn't matter Christine and the queens I Want to thank Chris so much for being are really enjoyed that conversation thanks as well to our senior
