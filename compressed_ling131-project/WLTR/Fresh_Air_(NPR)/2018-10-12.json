interview and I ran downstairs to get a cup of coffee and ran into the guest so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of invited her with my my maybe we should say uh where are you\nI don't know what I'm trying to get my name's yeah [noise]\nThe easy question I'm Catherine Rampell economics in Washington\nCivically Catherine writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect place to show this thing that in theory [noise] All right\nSo you're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nAnd I think I see [noise]\nHow much the same thing with kids on the board\nAlright misleading [noise]\nSo maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it with Catherine sees here is one price on the board and then this extra hidden thing that she has to\nAnd I can see now I have\nThat much but he was on the board\nA little misleading\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it with Catherine sees here is one price on the board and then this extra one thing that she has to pay for it\nAnd it's not just taxes sometimes it's Steve in service charges that seemed to appear out of thin air uh check out and drive us\nAll crazy booking rental cars buying concert tickets for like have you booked a hotel room recently sometimes there's an Internet the symptoms of the parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that is not a resort its but\nAnyways Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompanies should be competing based on price and quality and not ... uh and the fact that companies do compete on a ... does not create a better economy does not create or got better

salesman I have a very good friend who's a used car salesman so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nIs also probably our most controversial tweak\nYes major league baseball knows that it's games are a little too long and so they've been trying their own tweaks to speed up the game little things like\nLimiting the number of warm up pitch is making the commercial breaks between innings shorter and that's all fine but if they really wanted to speed the game up they would be a little more serious about listening to tweak proposed by this man\nEr my name is David ... professor politics or New York university you like baseball I'm a fan a but not a rabid fan [noise]\nNo not one who's willing to blindly follow all rules of baseball I suppose\nYou know I propose some reforms\nSteve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the catch up rules yeah like guy you want to catch up with mustard on that guy is not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up Steve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch up rule\nIn baseball and works as follows a that if you're the team my head\nFan or but not a rapid fan [noise]\nNo not one who is willing to blindly follow all rules of baseball I suppose\nYou know I propose some reforms\nSteve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the catch up rule yeah light guy you want to catch up on my stood on that guy is not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up\nSteve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch up rule\nIn baseball and works as follows a\nThat if you're the team ahead in ing and your bat then you get only two outs rather than three out in that inning\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances Steve\nAnd a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand we went back\nTo Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyze a each pitch\nFor over a hundred thousand games and asked if the ketchup ... been in place how things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter with these games are bed the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost an hour from the game and a half an hour was the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well a critically I Would say\n[laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win\nWould be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost half an hour from a game and a half an hour was the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there had been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's\nAlso got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd give them only Eighteen seconds at the end of the game when Mike\nHow you are a true iconoclast route [laughter] we'll see what happens\nWe don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much and don't go to any

yogurt has had more ups and downs and really more downs then just about any other ... and it's a pretty unlikely tail to begin with\nTwo eco hippie farmers with no real desire to build a company wind up building a company they start small milking their own cows making their own yogurt selling locally to nuns and then eventually spreading themselves way too thin\nAnd sliding into deep debt you know over the years don't you killed his headache bowls slew of near death experiences\nBut it never quite died and in fact it grew and grew into one of the most popular yogurt brand in the United states and one thing about starting fields cofounder Gary ... is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company\nHe knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire his dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days there were probably fifty shoe manufactures and New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so so how many people did your dad's company employs several thousand I think at their peak they were the twenty eight hundred\nFields cofounder of Gary ... is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company he knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire is dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it was a in those days they were probably fifty shoe manufacturers and New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so so how many people did your dad's company employ several thousand I think at their peak they were twenty eight hundred\nWow these are true company towns of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in the region in the country were were built on things that we made\nIn the dark side of that is that when they simply because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed you know all these communities did as well\nAnd what happened to your family [noise]\nUh well it was really a three three for uh the family's business uh went bankrupt ah my parents got divorced\nAnd my uh\nSort of childhood role model a died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a it was a wake up\nHere ... yeah I um my father a got a began drinking ...\nHelping us to build a successful business and and instead of asking for a grant I'm asking you for a long [noise]\nHelping us to build a successful business and and instead of asking for a grant I'm asking you for a long\nAnd I wound up borrowing a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars [noise]\nAnd then I went out to our lenders of the hundred and twenty five K.\nAnd I said look I'm Will you take stock and this company and we did our first private placement [noise]\nYou know through a dart at the Weill figured out the value of the business will what value but at the time\n[laughter] well we\nThought we were going to value it at a million dollars but then in Nineteen eighty four our sales were up to around two hundred and fifty thousand a year and this is just in in New Hampshire or all over New England\nWell by eighty four we were starting to push the boundaries\nWere selling to about twenty stores and eventually we started selling to a an independent grocers seven stores and um this will give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one Sunday night we were having dinner at\nThe Caymans after milking and the phone rings and a ... a nephew of the\nOwner of the militias market basket chained ... calls and says Samuel or why are you selling them by competitive than not to me that he had thirty four stores at the time is up and said well to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cows he said well get some\nCows and he slammed the phone down and we took that\nAn independent grocer who had seven stores and uh this\nWill give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one

and we took that is very good business advice so we\nWent out and grew are heard even further and then so we now realize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed to lease a small refrigerator truck and started delivering actually to the market basket where warehouse\nHow much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing now about\nThree hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt and a case like twenty four cups six ... six packs of court and so by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed in the sort of half a million dollar range but you were probably spending more money than you are bringing in right\nOh my God you have no idea yeah we were burning I mean I capital not weekly cash flows not daily casualty I kept hourly cash plus I knew on a

almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nIn those days a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part of hope and they had one store in Cambridge and prospect street and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket this is now I'm Talking July of eighty\nFour and um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we could crack bread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont who ... in their Tea Party with their wet go you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in the hamster [laughter] ... what you guys do\nSo in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had\nMy old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus I'm prospects in Cambridge and asked for my yogurt that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Mary Carol Skinner the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof\nWere getting all kinds of requests for yoga ... when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first delivered that afternoon [noise] um about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circus and awfully went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles it's last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get it on people's miles and then the\nMary Carol Skinner the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof were getting all kinds of requests for yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first delivered that afternoon I'm about a month later we were her number one

thousand miles it's last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get it on people's miles and then they're going to ask\nFor it and and this is running around the time you meet\nMeg he would become your wife right\nYeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no ... northeast organic farming association conference and I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and the right after I finished my speech this very adorable\nOr organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there I waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state\nSo she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase and so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want what they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm is because they know that\nK with uh if I needed some money with lending me some well of course I needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter] I started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later ... well I think we can increase it so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got to cross the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm it's because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know\nSome Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money huh yeah yeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful oh yeah you know what happened in this farmhouse\nI always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAnd by this point it was a half a million dollar business and I never had\nCash in the bank that night before payroll never just
