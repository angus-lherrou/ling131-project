I'm a journalism professor I think a lot about a worry a lot about fake news and much generally I'm really concerned about trust on the Internet\nAnd ... ... came to us and said uh before there was fake news before there was the possibility of like fake video and fake audio the world was dealing with a different fake problem\nYes fake online reviews people have been posting this on as an online fake reviews for years\nYeah and and this is becoming such a huge problem because like you know I go on\nThis honest on line fake maybe it was four years yeah and and this is becoming such a huge\nProblem because like you know I go on line to buy a hover board and I don't know if this report has five stars because it is awesome and I'm going to cruise around town looking cool or if it has five stars because someone is making up those reviews and in fact when I take it home it's going to set my house on fire\n... is here with a glimmer of hope for us yeah\nAnd the dilemma of it's coming

things\nSo just you know I'll be like in the grocery store and they'll have like an avocado and the onion and a a bottle of\nThat's high stakes you're dropping out of the Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand six told me it was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen\nAnd it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds Monday Tommy was hanging out with a friend but he says hey you want the rest of this pretty workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift more longer and harder um\nYou know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways\nEr and harder um you know at least those are the claims\nJust to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways\n... friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he's asked to tell me\nAll right so this one has a hundred and Seventy seven reviews for stars like that which is great on the surface\nAnd then you take the URL copy it and then you pasted into review meta okay and then I hit my report and events that report right and it's though\nComputing bleep bleep bleep bleep whatever it's going to take a wild reading like a hundred and Seventy seven reviews would take me like five hours at any rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noone in on the line to walk us through a few of the things his website flag\nReviews would take me like five hours at any rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noone in on the line to walk us through a few of the things his website flag about these iPhone cable reviews\nOkay so for this product we see that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average\nThese views of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average views they weigh more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with\nWords that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we build a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example the court\nIs very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise] um yeah\nAnd and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the cord and to use again ah I don't know what it means seven people feel that way [laughter] well\nSeven people also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is an ... [laughter]\nYeah so Tommy software vent about a dozen different tests than I Am phone cable reviews and his reports it out and it just aggravating uh\nSoftware random about a dozen different tests than I Am phone cable reviews and his reports it out and adjusted invading\nA so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy side only trust at six percent of the reviews and that trust way they view say actually these cables that crap\nTommy says generally speaking cables like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm like what yeah yeah I phoned cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills to stop\nWe of course reached out to Amazon about this and they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they sent us an extensive statement about it\nHave you met itself admits that they do not have the\nSafety if you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even said with high confidence whether a review was fake according to what\nAmazon saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFor Amazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of views on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake viewers\nIn other words Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust that be\nAmazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSuch complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products right\nLike it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review it someone buys a product that's good for the site\nBut that that might come a time\nWhere there was just too many fake Phoebe sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up\nYes on the Internet shopping and we'll

place where people could hang out for a long time maybe even have a PTA meeting or social gathering and really linger over that bagel or a couple of soup\nAnd this is the famous third place concept that both Howard Schultz and Ron shake wanted to tap into in that ... became one of the fastest growing restaurant chains in the world in fact if you invested the seven thousand dollars in Paris stock in Nineteen Ninety nine\nYou'd be sitting on more than half a million dollars by two thousand Seventeen now the thing is if you met Ron shake say in high school this is not the pad and you'd have

and the story of how he eventually build an Arab red is just how many times along the way he sees new opportunities or as to improvise and adapt again and again and again\nRon comes to a point where he has to make a big pivot and transformed his business and in Nineteen eighty\nFive three years after Iran acquires a small fringe bakery in Boston called a ... a business that's really struggling\nHe manages to turn things around with his partner Lou came [noise]\nBut it's still a small business in fact Ron himself works at the sales counter during the day [noise]\nBut doing that actually helps them figure out almost by accident his next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five I Would be in a restaurant and working and I'd have a customer walk up to ... city\nKennedy in Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five I Would be in a restaurant and working and I'd have a customer walk up to me guy saying quote I have that bad I said sure and they say slice it I'd have them do both and they pull out a back from the local\nSupermarket from a local stop and shop\nAnd they put roasted turkey and maybe\nAnd you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA to say wow\nThe real thing here is that the ... is not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the first French bakery cafe\nIn the Copley Place mall in Boston so you decided that you were going to make this a new experience new open pen experience where people could come and\nEat lunch and buy bread\nYeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right in almost instantly is broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened the Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we opened the doors\nAnd what were you certainly there [noise] um we were serving sandwiches\nAnd some soups made on our bread in costs on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on on a real French baguette it would be a\nRoasted turkey and brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing and I don't think we had the language for back then but with the big recap I was\nWas an altar of between down and dirty fast food yeah and fine dining yeah and for people who were working in white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings\nThis was the first example of what we later came to ...\nPeople who were working white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings this was the first example of what we later came to call vast casual\nThis was going to do something that was better but in a quick service mode\nSo so once you serve stones\nIdea of creating cafes and bakeries it was after the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin a pretty rapid expansion\nWell guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a decree cafe we saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot [laughter] you know every major office building one of the French the cricket and we found we developed big competitors\n[noise] alright says something something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is a long panic choirs is a small chain of St Louis based\nSandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy a dislike small chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn it into a ...\n[noise] no I you know I I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to me several gentleman who owned a company called sales brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing ... almost as much as we did with an old bone pet but doing so in suburban St Louis\nAnd it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis bread company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in the suburban marketplace while oh bump him was our urban stress\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars [noise]\nRight so you choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to [noise]\nLouis brick company is Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nOr so you acquire St Louis bread company and you will not going to\nGive it the name of them had it was going to be St Louis red company or did you initially and did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing\nBut we rename than concept an air bread in all markets others in St Louis but we renamed it ... bread\nBecause as we went to new markets people often thought St Louis was more associated with Clydesdale horses now than it was with breath right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight near you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where we could you expand beyond those original Nineteen yeah by Nineteen Ninety eight\nWe roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was having one of those moments that all CEOs have of self reflection\nAnd frankly I was kind of bummed I was looking at an Arab read as one of four divisions in this\nMulti divisional restaurant kind of on than I had a bump in a lump and international I
