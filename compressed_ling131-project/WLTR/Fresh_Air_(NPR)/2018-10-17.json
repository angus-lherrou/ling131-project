affordable\nHigh quality health care and we're South Carolina is at the top of the list now to live work raise a family and build a business\nWhen I served in lead American Soldiers in combat I cared more about their future and their very lives than my own and we need a governor who cares more about our future then the next primary election\nOut of this as for your prayers for my family\nAs for your support\nAnd I know is governor our best days are ahead of us thank you thank you both [noise]\n\nLet me let me start questioning here I'm Weibo your enthusiasm but it can erode time away from your candidate our role is to Alicia substantive answers\nMore than political cliches that will help to people to South Carolina decide which view as the better choice for the next four years with that in mind it's been several months since we had our last round of debates and they have not been ... months hurricanes Florence Michael have left there mark on South Carolina in some areas severe and deadly marks\nYou were both appropriately involved you as a governor you as a member of the of the ... the national guard and these are certainly not the last hurricanes\nAnd deadly marks you were both appropriately involved you as governor you as a member of the of the of the national guard and these are certainly not the last hurricanes or floods we will see so\nTell me if you will what did you learn and as governor what would your priorities be to prepare for it and cope with future situation she Smith we'll start with you\nCharles wood forests continue to think about those that were directly affected by the storms in the recovery still goes on\nAnd as governor I'll be there with those that are fighting to recover not do is Henry did when he vetoed desperately needed federal Ethan had the upon the Republican the Democrats come together to override his knee to that desperately needed felt politically\nI Will be there as governor before the storm and after the storm I've been there as a national guardsmen for two decades facing the natural disasters that have faced are say one cog in a very big will a part of a great team making sure that South Carolina's prepared but we have to do a better job principally\nAnd making sure we invest in our infrastructure and so unlike Henry\nI'm going to sign the bills are going to improve our infrastructure I'm going to move our state forward and make the investments are going to prepare us for the storms of the future and I'll be there to make sure that we have the resources to recover and that we work with local communities to make sure the infrastructure is there so they can get back on their the\nMaster\nWell we're gonna have more stones or whatever have more flooding and we have to plan for the future\nOr in recent years it's become clear will have to do that that's why earlier this week after consideration for a number of months in talking to a number of experts in there and we are usually executive order creating for the first time\nIt commission on flooding and it will address flooding along our coastal flooding in rivers\nAnd we will bring the ... best minds the best ideas from ...\nAnd that will address flooding along our coastal flooding in rivers\nAnd we're going to bring the ... best minds the best ideas from infrastructure construction to preventive measures we can take to such things as sea walls and everything in between to see to it than our people in their profit is safe and secure\nBut back to the ... the most recent one we got floated from all over the country we had the best team in the United states according to people who come here and work with us in putting pieces back together in preparing for these these floods and these disasters and we have the full support of the White House in the administration and getting the help we need\nTo help people and I'm sure oh sure you were going to get it\nOut I'm I'm Glad you mentioned infrastructure because it's a concern seems even as we're struggling to get our roads and bridges back in shape\nAnd nature may be winning the battle at times let me ask you about starting with you this time governor what is the increasing severity of these storms are said to you about global warming and why do we even permit or even ... rebuilding and such flood blow in areas\nWhere we wish you start first of all we we have a state law [noise] and our Sunday a\nPart of that are just recently to see that the setback lines in such a long enough cos are given a ... or given the right time to have him sit in the right place they've been sending the wrong place we have to we started to retreat from the beach and we have to be\nVery careful that we're not building in those areas and that's one reason we need a plan that's the reason that I've started\nThis group that will understand all the options what's been done and other parts of the world is one of those other parts in the United states but as far as infrastructure go we we have we have great needs in South Carolina and we have great new age for example in five twenty six five twenty six\nAs far as infrastructure go we we have we have great needs in South Carolina\nAnd we have great news for example in five twenty six five twenty six has a highway and it must be built in order to facilitate the exit and back to waste into those places are the same thing in our Seventy three I've taken steps recently to say that both of those ... are getting done I Know how to do it I've had a record or do we get it done\nSmith from ... to think of Charles this was this was another one of those occasions\nWhere you know Henry you have to care more about doing a job than keeping the job and when it came time to sign the bill that was passed by a vast majority of Republicans and Democrats in the house\nAnd in the Senate to pay a better future for us to improve our roads and improve our bridges and prepare us for future storms that are directly related to climate change\nWe got it done we weren't together Republican the Democrats and it was used or Henry who who vetoed the bill and then begged us to override it before the ink had time to draw that is not the profile in courage that we need in South Carolina\nWe need to make sure we got a governor of working for us and serving the people of South Carolina\nAnd that's what I'll do I'll care more about their future than mine political future and we need that kind of leadership in South Carolina I Know this\nWe're going to see the future of writers storms and they are coming and experience it up had been a part of the south Carolina team and working are all hazards plant has made me prepared to make the right decisions and the future and when a to Institute a of accusations\nThank you and Andy Shane has the next round of questioning starting with a representative Smith\nThe post and courier asked each of you last week about how you would change the tax code here in South Carolina\nPart of our budget which is twenty six billion and counting federal money that comes in is about ten billion or nine billion some where we're going to get a billion dollars to pay and what does what does the streams that come with that do to private business and industry\nHere's the answer that are removed a regulation that allows nurse practitioners to go anywhere on to the states\nAre any number of them under the supervision of a physician anywhere in the state\nTaking the nurse practitioners out to the rural people into the rural areas to the drug stores to the to the grocery store and all the clinics and those kind of things that kind of expansion into a medicine that is an angel it's free enterprise it it doesn't cost any tax money thank you\nThat is a free enterprise it it doesn't cost any tax money thank you\nMe follow up governor everything I Want to make sure the numbers are right my understanding was that that the cost\nTo South Carolina had Medicaid expansion been accepted would have been in the neighborhood of six hundred million dollars over a span of I Believe in seven years that's not right and that the returns would be a loving point two billion dollars so that's not right what what other what are the number\n... it it goes it goes up for a number of years and then it then it leveled off but in addition to the goal\nIs not your dollar as are not on your back there is not always a nine to [noise]\nRemain a one dollar from South Carolina for nine dollars from Washington is that ... that is correct so is is there a risk to cheat or did you see of being too dependent on the federal government\nI see us having to pay that part of it is Monday of which we don't have much money will have to take from schools my will have to take some roads ... take from law enforcement that's that's a lot of money for us to be paying for system\nThat is not going to work in under Obamacare the insurance premiums are any more and more but before we started in addition to that they put in\nA stranglehold on businesses owned Sharon's companies on everybody else we don't need that ... there's a better way in the better way is with free enterprise and for the mention unleash the nurses are released the nurse practitioners get used tele medicine get the doctors\nYou don't bring the ... make the person go to the hospital you take the hospital you take the health care to them is individual as they should and that will work it will cost the state of mind [noise]\nIs is a risk of becoming to defend no not not what my\nIs is the risk of becoming to defend no not not with my plan and the way to sort of South Carolina Henry you're wrong on the facts and your own for South Carolina the fact is this when we\nWhen we accept the Medicaid sons\nI Know when the first three years there'll be zero revenue a center house members of my colleagues I won't have to ask you for any within the first three years and what we're going to do is prepare for the future and most of the seven to ten percent by the time we get ten years from now it is the most fiscally responsible thing to do it delivers on an entire\nHealthcare economy forty thousand jobs\nAnd you know what we are not getting healthier under your pursuit right now in to the ... the state you would have we simply right now have right now\nWe have input mortality morbidity rights to equate that developing countries\nHenry I'm going to do something about it when I'm elected governor I'm going to serve the people and make sure we improve health care outcomes and when we do that you know we say tax dollars and we have a more prosperous state because we were responsible use that ... that resource for the people of South Carolina thank your industry\nQuestion we'll start with representative Smith\nIn recent years South Carolina has had a spate of gun violence we had the Charleston church massacre we had a first grader who was shot and killed on the playground and the upstate and most most recently here in Florence we had seven police officers were shot in a gunfight\nWhat needs to change to curb the gun violence that we're seeing in the nation most importantly here in South Carolina but obviously it's a nationwide nationwide issue or force\nWe remember officer care away all of the six that were wounded that terrible day and the risks they take every day in standing for us that there's something around the corner in the car they risk their lives every day and they deserve our support in there\nAnd the risks they take every day in standing for us that there's something around the corner in the car they risk their lives every day and they deserve our support and their families and I will be there for them or as just as I was there for my soldiers in Afghanistan\nBut we can do more I Know we can do more to keep guns out of the hands of those it shouldn't have them in opposition is in full agreement and its support with law enforcement in military professionals the fact is Henry supports allowing individual cicada carry a are fifteens openly down the streets in Florence\nHe thinks is we ought to have this constitutional carry which I think is is consistent with the communities that we want to have I been in places where everybody's onto the team\nAnd I promise you you don't feel safer also going to work to close the Charleston loophole work a lot to make sure we we ... we make sure we make improvements there and I know that there's bipartisan support for that and as governor I look for the Senate bill\nBrother Charles loophole is actually not a loop hole but it was a failure of technology\nRight now they're they're all sorts of qualifications one must meet in order to\nBe clear to buy a gun to begin with and the apple in their strong the problem is\nAs tragically happened in Charleston is the system did not work fast enough there's a three day period if the system does not say yes or no within three days then the answer is yes we have the technology to see that we have ample information into the system that can produce an answer\nImmediately that will keep those as it would have this young man from from being able to purchase a fire on in the first place\nBut you have to always get back to the second amendment the second amendment is in the constitution for reasons\nThe recent case up in D.C the Heller case I Believe just a few years ago said the costs that extends to to you in in your home it extends to people not just militia\nCase I Believe just a few years ago said the costs that extends to to you in in your home it extends to people not just militia when you start intruding on the on the second amendment that is when we get into deep trouble as happened in other countries we don't want it to happen here we have to be smart but we don't want to be cared\nAbout let me be clear how do we how do we curb how what what could help\nAnd what this is\nWhat I just described would be one thing but the answer to these kinds of things as an alert citizenry and good law enforcement we've got the best law enforcement in South Carolina of any place in the whole country if we train them if we if we educate them\nIf we give them the the machinery give them the tools that they need to do their job they can make the place a lot safer than it is now\nEverybody ought to be the neighbors keep to an extent in ... when you see something say something that a lot of things you just can't solve with you I don't know the law that a lot of things that\nThe average citizen all of us must do to help keep place safe and help keep the children [noise]\nWhat do we need to do to curb this what what is what laws do we need an aquifer ... right now I didn't\nMention you know supporting which I have other Charleston loophole and we've made some significant progress and I agree with the governor we need to be there for law enforcement I Believe we have the very best in the world and they deserve the best in terms of training and resources also want to do more to to improve the security in our schools\nAnd I know and I believe we can have a school resource officer in every school five twenty twenty and we're already doing it we're working with Republicans and Democrats in the house and Senate and we're getting it done\nAnd it will happen also want to make sure that there was a hotline for every student that they can reach out if they see something they can say something without fear of a peer pressure and I'll put those things in place as governor\n... let me ask for a quick follow up a hundred and thirty ... guns were found\nSomething they can say something without fear of a peer pressure and I'll put those things in place as governor well let me ask very quick follow up\nA hundred and thirty ... guns were found in the home of the shooter Lawrence a hundred and thirty ... is that appropriate is that should not be allowed to have that many guns in there on\nAs long as he is a law abiding citizen and and has a shore I mean I don't think there's any ability to restrict that under current laws or under the constitution but uh I mean obviously what happened here a is a horrific tragedy and and I don't know if there was indications ahead of time that would allow the prevention of that but it points out\nThe type of risk that are on law enforcement take every day\nJust simply delivering a subpoena or a search warrant they're at risk for such an event every day\nAnd a lot of a ... hunters and our state around the country probably have that many firearms in the house and they never have\nOh I haven't I haven't heard of soul and and never will ask why we need to be careful now that was a tragic situation\nOf course but yes we are in my state of the state address I asked for a certified train on law enforcement officer in every school in every district in every county in South Carolina and the legislature I asked for five million dollars I gave me two million dollars\nI'm Kate Bush into we be sure that we have them everywhere that is one thing that I have done to make that true in South Carolina to\nKeep our children's safe and I'm gonna keep doing it to keep those children's sake [noise]\nGentlemen let's let's stay in the schools for a little bit longer here\nUm education you both for referring to the resource officers there is an apparent budget surplus for this fiscal year in the neighborhood of a hundred and Seventy seven million dollars is the number that sticks and in my mind teachers are asking for a substantial part of that\nOther state employees I suspect would like some of it too\nTeachers are asking for a substantial part of that\nOther state employees I suspect it was like some of it to do they deserve it you're probably in trouble if you say you know bought his show what portion by what criteria do you address the need for more funding for teachers starting with your representative Smith\nWell it it's just a fact we have a teacher crisis in South Carolina and the number one job of the governors of nature all our children have access to high quality education and that's why [noise]\nThrough its growth and economic prosperity to give more than five or six or seven percent of the budget the colleges we needed to go back go\nI just I mean it was fun to the ... you know I Am just very grateful and glad so this institution at France's Marion university that virtually every number or the general assembly\nSo you know I Am just very grateful and glad so this institution at France's Marion university the virtually every number or the general assembly Republican and Democrat disagreed with you and decided to fund the censuses\nWalking kind of young guys are both of you mentioned of course trying to get the legislature to give more money to support schools for those who don't know um after the recession the the amount of percentage that are public colleges received in money from the legislature dropped it really hasn't been restored to those pre recession levels\nThe Senate Finance chairman a sitting here on the front row you're the governor obvious but you're you're the governor in twenty Nineteen what do you say ... how do you convince him to have the legislature give more money to public colleges hey you've got more money [laughter]\nBut it hasn't worked so far [laughter] [noise]\nWe do that is we demonstrate that by lowering taxes by a lemonade and inefficiencies by fixing the road by doing all the things that we need good law enforcement we have businesses that are moving in businesses here are expanding\nPeople are working there they're they're paying more tax money into the system but even though it's a lower rate\nThen we will have plenty of money to do these kinds of things and that's the day I'm looking forward to now we're gonna have to work to get there but I'll tell you and they are lining up the companies from all over the world contrary to what Mr Smith lining up to come to South Carolina is getting here real fast and it's a great situation to be represent\nUs or if you've been in the legislature for two decades you have you know obviously had the opportunity to try to convince I'm a you know and your colleagues to to fund more for colleges as governor how would you get them to do that well and I do have it\nObviously had the opportunity to try to convince 'em out you know your colleagues to to fund more for colleges as governor how would you get them to do that well\nAnd I do have experience in bringing Republicans or Democrats together and actually passing legislation\nAnd have the experience to do that but also never been in charge and running things I've always had to cobble together support to do that and that's been importing experience for me to have and will be great experience for me to have as governor I certainly worked with my colleagues at a here tonight Mr Chairman and many others\nOn making sure how we how we fix these things and focus on the things that are most important and we're already doing that together or we worked on this uh tuition freeze initiative which I Know it's going to make a difference and we're going to focus on performance space funding for schools\nTo make sure that we set our kids up for success that they don't get out of college with a massive amount of debt and no economic opportunities because Henry the deal is this [noise]\nYou got to live on workforce education and you're not doing it now the fact is the number one decision for industries that come here is do we have an available workforce that is prepared for the job\nAnd we know and you know that's the greatest challenge and you've all for nothing to change that what I'm going to do is provide the alignment of our education system is going to make sure that our kids know in the classroom from their educational opportunities what the economic opportunities are when they get out and we're not going to wait till college or tech school we're going to start and K. through twelve\nAnd deliver that kind of project based warning there's going to make a difference and move South Carolina forward\nFor you to lay we already do in the wheels were also us secretary of commerce and said South Carolina has the best workforce development system in the United states we already to collaborate and among the four year schools are technical colleges even to the point of getting a baccalaureate degree from a technical college\nThat's a doctor Dr Miller up in Greenville take did their our technical colleges are wonderful\nPart of getting a baccalaureate degree from a technical college\nThat's a doctor Dr Miller up in Greece will take did that our technical colleges are wonderful where are these all these programs of collaboration with the high schools in the four year schools and on down there we're already doing that money's been provided to request at my request been provided to do that\nSo we're doing that but what we need to do is do more of it and we need we need the whole population to understand that there's a new world of opportunity through these technical colleges and worked for the young people can go and they do the things they want to do\nThey work with their hands and the brains and if they want to go on line and get a four year degree I get to know the degree that they can do that here better than anywhere\nWhere in better shape than the rest of the country on this my job is to say I've been doing the businesses that come in no that ended they collaborate with these schools in order to accomplish\nThank you gentlemen I Want to change the subject [noise]\nIn a newly released grand jury report investigating corruption in state government\nPoses a your names come up\nI don't know if there's anything you want to tell us a night but let me now are the questions\nYou boats dealt with the Clintons father Richardson Rick\nAs consultants lobbyists did they mislead you were you naive did you turn a blind eye was business as usual tell us more about that relationship\nStarting with humans and third in in reading that there are times when you sound\nDefensive about recording\nNot at all I I'll tell you Charles that this is my name is mentioned three times quite in passing one I'm quite proud of there was an F. C. N. G.\nOfficial who acts quite childish and insulting the in in the record and he says calls me a name I guess because I work so hard to protect write papers in our state he's not happy with me and I'm not going to be his job and her and uh in the future of the other\nBecause I've worked so hard to protect rate payers in our state he's not happy with me and I'm not going to be his job in her in a in the future of the other time wasn't incidental mentioned about a appearing are coming to in to a party or some sort of gathering of which I never received inviting and never attended a but the fact is is\nYou know represent far represent a quaint and I've worked on a number of issues including their band ability for a violation active which\nHenry V to but the fact is when we weren't together we've done some good things together at the same time I'm not responsible for their conduct but I've enjoyed the friendship and the relationship and the working relationship that we have had if you were governor what would what would your priority be in addressing corruption\nWhile I think is critically important an ethics ought to be on the agenda every year the fact is we can always make our institutions stronger more transparent and more accountable and I think clear after this we need to look at things like improving the definition of what it means to lobby\nWe did to make sure we need to get at dark money in our politics so we know who's trying to influence our vote and voters\nAnd we need to make sure that that those that are trying to influence local government that they have the same requirements because we know how much money they're spending they need to follow in some of the similar insane ethics rules and lobbying rules that apply to state government\nGovernor McMaster same question to you and and your name coming up as well at any point in this relationship where you misled or you're naive did you turn a blind eye to be treated as businesses you\nKnow I was never a misled asked me if I asked to do anything on toward by any of those those people they will consultant for me and my political campaigns and and that was it an hour's mentioned one time he was having attended a press conference with\nFormer Democrat attorney general transmit locking Palmer Republican attorney general Charlie ... and that was that where I was in in that report that was all also you're a member Charles cause you there when you had these early\nIn Palmer Republican attorney general Charlie ... and that was\nWhere I was in in that report that was all\nAlso you're a member Charles cause you there when we had these earlier debates size of candidates them for running against me were saying all sorts of things about how can we all tangled up in and of course none of that was true\nOr not in there and even two of the assistant prosecutors came out and said so they are and I think it was around all that does nothing about me and and that wasn't going to be\nBut you know if they send us governor what would your priorities started that Governor Governor Haley appointed me too\nAnd Travis matlock attorney former attorney general transmitted lock they hid the ethics reform commission which we did in two thousand eleventh two thousand twelve and we came up with a list record you own the commission's is your room we came up with a lot of good ideas some of which costs wheels\nBut we we have Institute in some of those now is you know the ethics commission itself can investigate it can't prosecute it ought to be able to prosecute we wanted them to do that and I'd like to see that done but also\nI've asked repeatedly ... we changed all also that lobbyists who people who the lobby municipalities and also lobbying county council half the law they have to register just like everybody else so we'll know who they are and who who's paying whom and why they're there\nThe other the other thing is the freedom of Information Act is a powerful vehicle for the truth and openness and accountability you had to apply to the legislature to her house and the Senate and I propose that I proposed it in my\nState of the state address I've requested it we're working towards it and that was also in our report back then switches viewed as the gold standard of ethics were fold all of those things I've been working on and we're going to get those ...\nMe ask you votes quickly one other thing about that report that came out to the grand jury report harshest criticism seems to be leveled at current\nGet those ... let me ask you both quickly one other thing about that report that came out of the grand jury report harsh criticism\nSeems to be leveled at current attorney general Allen Wilson who's running for reelection and your mind is the attorney general have more to answer a or or is his functioning as attorney general in any way imperiled start with you governor\nI don't know the facts of all of that so I think if anyone has any questions I can certainly ... understandings that investigation is over\nIt sounds to me like a ... there were many questions asked and answered I Know a lot of documents were were turned over the number of big number were listed in there\nI think if anyone has any questions is his campaign time now that now's the time to answer to ask him and get an answer if you also\nRepresentative Smith I Would agree
