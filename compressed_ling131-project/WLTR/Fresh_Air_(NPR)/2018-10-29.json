I think we all ... to know a little bit more about each of them about ... ...\nSo let me start with the question to both here I think we all in this study is like to know a little bit more about each of you run an admitted to go by quickly could you expand for example on how you were chosen why you think you were chosen\nHow governor master and representative Smith money has approached too I'm rolling of several things together here but I Know that in in your case uh Missouri but\nYou really didn't appear to have known government the McMaster all the long before he was elected you to run with them in your case you worked with dreams moved from the legislature you might be to ... the pros and cons to both of those so we'll start with you for your for free market Missouri\nOkay thank you Charles well I've known James Smith for ten years he uh he helped me in two thousand eight when I when I ran for South Carolina Senate\nI was unsuccessful in that race that he uh he sent people to help me get organized and uh and learn how to run a campaign I didn't know him at that point but he believed in may and believed in my abilities I have twenty years' experience and municipal a government I\nTurn to for the city of Lancaster in the town attorney for the town of car shop so I have a lot of experience in local government I have six years experience working in the south Carolina house of representatives James and I have worked together across the aisle to bridge the divide between Republicans and Democrats\nTo get substantive bills passed all the way from bills dealing with child abuse to bills dealing with solar in renewable energies and he himself has hasn't been able to pass over sixty pieces of major legislation all while being in the minority party we share that in common that we can bridge that gap\nAnd work across the aisle with Republicans in order to get things\nDuring the same question to you how did you get to be part of the ... and and the relationships with groups of Mr ...\nIn order to get things done like you're an ... century the same question to you how did you get to be part of the ticket and and the relationship with with Mr McMaster\nWell the governor and I met um\nTwo years ago almost two years ago now and we instantly had had a connection\nUm I was we were we were um\nWe were drawn together um during the Donald Trump um campaign\nWe had very light values\nAnd the governor and I shared ... or send them about how it should go how we should be pro business we should make it it\nAttractive for businesses to want to come to South Carolina economic development is what helps drive an economy we know that we know the enemy of education is poverty\nAnd the only way to stop poverty is through economic development we share the same ideals and I was honored when the governor called me I wasn't sure why he was making the phone call to me at the time\nBut I was very honored when he did ask me to be his running mate\nStored the second question we're through Missouri a cut up a debate last week we asked both of the gubernatorial candidates are exactly what their running mates would be doing as lieutenant governor in a position that has no more for this you will stop the the marker\nA because it has changed for Muslims who tonner governor used to do governor molesters should a childhood dream business experience a he said she's with her ... I'm a lawyer we think that's a pretty good combination but could you tell me then\nHow you're going to put this how are you going to create this job craft as\nWell I'm excited to be an extension of the governor's office I Want to work with the legislature or many of them I've got to know really well during the primary and the primary run off and now during the general election I'm excited to work with them to\nMany of them I've got to know really well during the primary in the primary run off and now during the general election\nI'm excited to work with them to break down the silos that seem to happen in Colombia to make sure that programs are running efficiently that we're spending the hard earned money that the taxpayers of South Carolina or sending to Columbia that we're spending is the best way possible\nThat's where I think my accounting background and my business experience you know my husband and I started our company from a start up company and it was through efficiencies that we're able to grow to the size we are today I Want to take that to Columbia and be a fresh set of eyes and a fresh perspective on what's been happening down there\nTo see how I can lend a hand helping the governor was what we feel is important economic development we know that will solve a lot of problems here in our state\nLike you're a ... a representative Smith flooded your legislator to experience so so did you could a stark without a day or on the job training to move legislation through the house and Senate likelihood is still going to be a Republican House and Republicans soda and you'd be democratic returned to governors or how do you do that\nActually that's quite easy if you look at the the way that the house and Senate overrode Henry McMaster vetoed many of which we\nSpoke on and encourage the chamber to override you'll see that our ... our relationships with fellow members of the general assembly are much better than Henry McMaster as relationship with the general assembly\nI Will I Will work uh across the aisle just as James and I have both done through out our ah our legislative careers and and we have built coalitions\nYou know there was that there have been points when when they came up and I asked leadership you know do you need me to override that veto one day I had a a an event with my daughter and they said oh no we're going to override that veto and this was leadership this list\nYou know do you need me to override that veto one day I had a a an event with my daughter and they said oh no we're going to override that veto and this was leadership this with people in his own party and and they are we're working together in the house and Senate now to um\nThing to uh I'm I'm curious question first from Missouri and then for you to know each other at all barely hardly\nWe met one day in Georgetown we did that one day in Georgetown and and and just kind of in passing here on the trail a little bit how do you feel\nThe two tickets gender balanced you think this was a coincidence the more broadly what's your view of diversity\n[noise] well I I think the ...\nGender balanced you think this is a ... a more broadly what your view diversity\n[noise] well I I think diversity is wonderful because diversity is how we can craft the best ideas that we've come together 'cause like I said earlier everybody comes at things with different perspective\nYou know when I met community in Georgetown I said to her um the fact that I'm a woman is very apparent and it's not something that we we really talked about much on our campaign and really we try to\nTo stay away from because we wanted to concentrate on issues and qualifications and what we can bring to the ticket and not so much just started under\nSome course do you think you Charles\nIn terms of gender balance and and women in politics you know we don't have a lot of women in a political office in South Carolina I was the uh the first female city attorney for the city of Lancaster I was the first woman to be the town attorney for the town of ... and I was the first woman to represent my district and the house of representatives\nSo much the trailblazing women who came before me but I Hope that my daughter and Pamela his daughter are able to grow up\nAnd come into being in a a in a state where being the first female anything is no longer a thing I Want women in government and women in business to be so mundane that we don't even talk about it anymore we need diversity this is one way of getting diversity there\nMany many other avenues for it but\nI'm looking forward to having more women in politics\nAnd has the next show to questions starting with the question was neural let's talk about a top issue for many south Carolinians al ... a South Carolina ranks among the Fifteen states with the highest percentage of uninsured people under the age of sixty four according to the park\nAl ... a South Carolina ranks among the Fifteen states at the highest percentage of uninsured people under the age of sixty four according to the cars are Family Foundation\nAnd one out of five or ... in our state has no health insurance and\nIf we're not going to expand Medicaid how to improve health care industry\nAny we are going to expand Medicaid and I am so excited about that\nBecause on day one after James Smith is sworn in he is going to accept the federal health care fines\nAnd he is going to provide health care coverage for three hundred thousand south Carolinians who don't have it today it will create forty four thousand new jobs and and inject two billion dollars a year into our economy and I couldn't be more excited about that but he looked like you're about to enter\nA plea because the legislature may not funded and it made it may be basically deal what do you do ... what else what else what else do you have you and your bed\nThe legislature will not have\nTo find it for the first several years and\nOur citizens will be so accustomed to having healthcare coverage\nThat the pressure will be so great to find that even when funding is necessary it will be at one to nine match will only have to provide ten percent of the funding in twenty twenty but for right now we can do it with absolutely no cost to taxpayers\nAnd once we create an entire healthcare economy with forty four thousand jobs and are saving people's lives\nThen it's going to be a popular endeavor\nOkay so that that right there is something that would scare every accountant that sitting right here in the state of South Carolina is the bill is coming and will figure out how to pay for it when it gets here\nRight here in the state of South Carolina is the bill is coming and will figure out how to pay for it when it gets here\nSince from two thousand two thousand Eighteen\nMedicaid has increase in the budget or the legislature approximately one point two billion dollars\nAnd there's a box of mentally six things the legislature focus is on the main main chunks of money that they spot and and it's the size and it's the high tech and its roads and it's higher education is education and its Medicaid\nSo when you're saying we'll find the funds even if it's nine to one you still have to find that money to fund it and if you're not going to take it away from one of the five programs that are already in place where are you going to get the money and it's something that James Mandy haven't wanted to say they're going to have to raise your tax dollars\nAre getting improve health outcomes Harvard Bruce getting more people insured if we're not going to spin well\nTaking medicine to rural areas I think that's really what we're talking about is how do we get\nHow do we get doctors we need to get more nurse practitioners out there\nWe need to make sure that we use telemedicine\nI mean health outcomes giving somebody an insurance card doesn't automatically make them healthy person\nSo you're saying giving them insurance is going to all of a sudden make south Carolinians healthy\nThere was that way you you may dishes our money\nThis is already money that we have paid to the federal government and they're asking us if we want it back and we are saying no thank you federal government you can keep our money that's like refusing your own income tax resigned and nobody does that\nBecause that would be stupid but South Carolina has done some really stupid things and refusing our own money that could ensure arts\nBecause that would be stupid but South Carolina has done some really stupid things and refusing our own money that could ensure our citizens and take care of people who are now dying who will not die when we accept our own money back and cover them with health care\nLike er into your next question is has ever\nDo would have to do and I don't know we both ... well no yeah because that that is only half\nHalf of this equation is the fact that the federal government is going to give us money the other half of that equation is we're going to have to come up with money to give back to them and it's a bill that they will send us that we will have to pay\nAnd what we're not saying as where are we going to get that money because if we're going to take that money away from education or higher education or infrastructure or DSS\nWere not to take it away from them or we're going to have to raise people's taxes and we already have the highest tax rates in the southeast across\nSouth Carolina ranks among the bottom ten and poverty rate and house average household income according to the U.S Census Bureau how do you plan to health care eradicate to help the poor and the legislature\nI think the best way we can advocate for the poor is to have economic development thriving in our state\nBy bringing good jobs in the south Carolina Good paying jobs\nThat help support that helps with a lot of problems you know the governor has\nHas has said this many times during his debate and on the road\nYou know he sat down with a superintendent or one of the schools and what he hates called the court or shame and asked her what would happen\nCame to your city\nShe took off for glasses through and she said it would change everything for us\nGood quality jobs or what we need to help the poor\nShe took off for glasses through and she said it would change everything for us\nGood quality jobs or what we need to help the poor\nThat is helping them\nHelping them up making feel good about themselves letting them giving them the advantage to spend their money the way they want to will come into the private sector I mean what would what have you seen that would affect us all well we have to lower taxes that's for sure we have to get business excited about here I think Tim Scott's Iowa way plan\nIs wonderful because we're giving\nBusinesses and his son has to go into the air you may not go into on their own and when they do that\nHelps everybody in that area was\nThank you Andy you know I hear this about how we need to recruit businesses to our area but it leaves out one very important aspect of a of how we recruit those businesses to our area and that is having a well educated workforce\nPrepared for the jobs that are here today and the jobs that are coming tomorrow and I have not heard one thing from Henry McMaster\nAbout how he is going to invest in public education to make sure that our students in our families are prepared for today's jobs and the jobs of tomorrow\nYeah James and I went to the U.S out to an economic developers conference and we learned there that incentives in tax breaks our number four on the list of what they're looking for when they're looking for a place to locate\nNumber one on the list is a workforce ready to work\nAnd having the skills and the ability and the education to do that from the start and we in South Carolina\nFamilies and our workforce in doing that and it's harder to recruit business when you don't have an educated workforce\nFinally throughout all out on behalf of the governor I'm I have stood with um\nBusiness when you don't have an educated workforce thank you I\nI liked her a bottle out on behalf of the governor I um I have stood with um him and heard him talk many types of businesses come here because of the people the people the people of South Carolina\nAnd what they like about South Carolina is the ... the relationship is they have with not only our colleges but our technical colleges we have some of the greatest technical colleges in the country and our governor has champion that across the state\nHe's trying to bring awareness to the normal parents the normal grandparents who thought going to touch nickel school was somehow a stepping down because we've always wanted to push our children into a four year college his champion that our technical Programme\nThat makes for a better outcome is there anything else we would ... oh and in for school districts that aren't aren't performing because there are small or they should be consolidated I think talking to Mali Spearman that something that she was looking at the school districts are not doing well bringing them together\nUsing their resources that they would use you know for two separate school boards\nThings like that overhead expenses and try to push that down to the student level\nWell you know\nA court decision determined that South Carolina's a standard for education was minimally adequate we have thought that\nJames and I have thought that that determination over and over you know but every single year the state adopts a law\nWill fund our schools at what is determined to be less than the statutory required men in them so that by definition is less than minimally adequate\nThat is failing our students and failing our teachers\nI agree that we need to lift regulations on teachers having a menace straighter\nWho handle the administration of a classroom so that the teachers can teach and the children can learn and do innovative programs like teen teaching and and looping and and the kinds of things where where younger teachers learn from older teachers and more experienced teachers because we've got to give back\nThe love of teaching to teachers so that we can retain them\nWhat if what if you look at how do you get the Republican controlled legislature to do what it does you said having gone\nWe have a relationship with in in the Republican controlled legislature in fact when a when session ended this time several in leadership came to us and said when you when bring us a plan for public education because we are ready to work on it\nThat's not something that I've heard from Henry McMaster I have not seen a single plan for public\nBring us a plan for public education because we are ready to work on it that's not something that I've heard from Henry McMaster I have not seen a single plan for public education from him and I looked\nIndia to a question about guns as related to the violence was and I want to\nStay a little more focused on the environment what in your review and we'll start with Ruth humor through what constitutes who speech and what role do you have ... in the political arena today thank Charles\nJames has has introduced hate crimes legislation that would increase penalties for those who commit crimes based on hate and and\nAnd this is the kind of thing that that would be um that would be dealt with under that but attacking it on the front\nThe issue of hate speech\nIs something that is is somewhat subjective that I think everybody knows that when they see it it's the kind of speech that the humanizes another person based on their race based on their ethnicity or based on their gender or based on their sexual orientation it\nWhen we permit people especially people in leadership we have a special obligation as people in leadership to not allow hate speech to not tolerated and certainly to not engage in it as I have heard from so many in leadership lately\nThat they will actually engage in hate speech that the humanizes other people and when you these humanize a person it's easy to see how violent scanner wrapped from mentally unstable people hearing that speech\nThank you very much was some question I agree I I agree we have to set that we have to set the example\nI don't agree with\nA lot of the direction that James immunity would like\nThat we have to set the example\nI don't agree with\nA lot of the direction that James a mandate would've liked to state the state and you know we have very different opinions and very different views on that but there are no way do I look at Mr ... my enemy\nWe're just two people that have different ideas about how to run a state\nAnd I think we have to be vigilant we we all know what hate speech is we all know when we read something and it makes us cringe on the inside that tape stage that's what I was talking about earlier that's when we have to see it we have to bring it to people's attention and we have to call it out\nOf it in your view was is President Trump responsible for any of those climate\nIn terms of the tenor of discussion in the political and engagement [noise]\nI Believe there is there's enough of that on both sides that we could probably talk about but I don't think we should ever blame somebody you know I sat in church on Sunday\nAnd I heard from the pope at that you you can't transfer the sins of one person to another person and that's not what we should be doing people have to take accountability for their own actions and those are the actions of that person and I know that when people do bad things that will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law here in the U.S\nMust really have a slightly different question for your for Democratic Party has has ribbon it was the Republican Party seems to be a and and you know there there are odds ... between different wins of your report and how to use Cody resolved but hardly gift of bitterness out of either of these parties\nActually I uh\nYou said that it is I agree with the Charles and I don't necessarily agree with you because with and\nUh when I go to meetings I pull up and I think Kelly exist bumper stickers\nI agree with you Charles and I don't necessarily agree with you because with and\nUh when I go to meetings I pull up and I think Kelly exist bumper stickers on cars and I see that you know and I hear from people who who want to welcome in\nPeople of all races and people of all religions and people of all I'm all ethnicities and beliefs and\nThat is something that I'm quite proud of and\nYou know I strongly believe that leaders have an obligation to call out anytime\nThat they hear such divisive into humanizing words coming from anyone with in their party or with in their their sphere of influence because we all have an obligation to recognize that the people who are our opponents are not our enemies and they are not evil they are just people we happened\nTo disagree with you during those search engine the Democratic burden\nAre factions if we just played that till the last election we happened to disagree with but not factions that used a humanizing speech toward others and as soon as the next set of questions and we'll start with Missouri [noise]\nDo the McMaster has said there were women in South Carolina or that we obviously slapping talks about how we have more jobs more economic development\nRepresentative Smith says we're not and he said that if a government master worry football coach who would be fired for the low ranking that we have an education healthcare and other issues owner versus a little bit [noise] so what is going well in state of South Carolina nor is\nIs going well and the state of South Carolina you know South Carolina is one of the most beautiful states probably the most beautiful state and the nation\nAnd you know and we fight every day to make sure that we remain one of the most beautiful states in the nation we fight against offshore drilling and we fight against those who would who would just\nSure that we remain one of the most beautiful states in the nation we fight against offshore drilling and we fight against those who would who would destroy our environment because all we have to do if we lose that battle one time\nThings are destroyed we have to continue to fight that battle and and it is one of the places that that people really really want to come to I mean obviously ms edit came from Ohio\nAnd and there are many people who are coming here because it is a beautiful beautiful state were growing at a terrific rate and and we have the challenges that come with that growth\nBut it's a a there are a lot of things that we could stand to improve and I totally disagree with on governor McMaster you heard my math earlier twenty three thousand jobs with a hundred thousand people coming in and not subtracting out the job we've lost and the thing governor is not winning\nSlogans reverse and you're done with the idea of a government master says we're winning well maybe there's some things were not winning at what are some of those things\nI've always been a glass as half full kind of person\nAnd let me tell you why when you're the governor and lieutenant governor and state you need to be the best cheerleader that you can be and you need to be the best leader you can be\nAnd how does it look when governor of the state stands up\nTries to rip apart everything that's going well in your state when I sit down with people people seem to be very happy in the state of South Carolina they have jobs unemployment has the lowest it's been\nSo why talk about what things are going wrong I say let's focus on what's going to\nIncrease the economic development will help with all the other challenges we have in our state\nSo let's focus on that let's keep people excited let's keep business excited about coming to South Carolina because that's what's going to continue to put us on them out\nTo the only thing we need the Sixers are attitude slow\nDecided let's keep business excited about coming to South Carolina because that's what's going to continue to put us on them out to the only thing we need a sixes are attitude\nWell I mean that's one good way of putting an anti I think we should all look at things and and and be positive about him you know I Can't eat an attitude I can be taught by an attitude\n[laughter] I mean let's be honest\nAbout the poor before I mean obviously one out of you know one out of ourselves killing you don't have health insurance and others who doesn't gonna ... you\nKnow but a good paying job is definitely going to help them and that's what we're striving for\nSo I think what I just heard was that we just need to say it's good and it will be good or people will think it's good but\nWhen we talk about when they talk about adding twenty three thousand jobs but not subtracting out the jobs that we've lost her recognizing that we've grown at the rate of a hundred thousand since he came into office that\nIs just sticking your head in the sand and pretending things are okay when they are really not the bureau of Labor Statistics has shown that our labor participation rate in South Carolina is the third worst in the nation that", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018",
