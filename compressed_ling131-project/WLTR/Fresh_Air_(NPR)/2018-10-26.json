Halloween episode of Planet Money I Would absolutely make that in collaboration with the amazing team that makes twenty thousand hurt [noise]\nReal food but it's portable inconvenient but case indulgent like shouldn't be eating it like junk food I mean I don't know that day at that moment\nIt was like this surge of energy I God I could feel this excitement over an idea it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around every day with ideas for whatever reason and bad day in that time and all those little experiences that built up and I I just felt a\nWhat'd you do did you like run home and and and in certain like writing things down or drawing pictures or did you just kind of model referral for a while\nSo I ran down the mountain I got a new book and I started writing\nDown ideas and then when we got back to Denver but how can I take ... nuts and spices and turn them into something really exciting and I would get ideas from pies and cookies and cakes and I think okay how do\nI take and cherry pie and make it just in my quiz and art and basically a raw raw and processed food and make it taste like cherry pie or apple pie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining that's going to do a lot of cooking and you're in your kitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and you're just gonna get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like you can continue like Dicky ball of a match\nAnd then you would like take it out with your hands in [noise]\nSticky like getting dipping being like ... all of a match and then you would like to take it out with your hands and like I went out with a rolling pin and then\nUm I got to cut her and I would like to cut her and I would cut it out and just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean ... batch after batch after ... ... ...\nAnd did you have any of your own I mean do you have any cash digital sort of asking parts to help you out in a year while you were not you know we're getting a salary how did you pay your bills um within\nAbout a week I realized oh I had I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought I'm going to start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know yeah\nSo a whole foods opened their first store in Denver\nAt exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and they in in the neighborhood I grew up in actually and I thought huh I'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work and their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself this is really going to be the big deal like this people are gonna want want by these\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression so I first you know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say\nI Would buy those and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was how in the world\nAsking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or she's going to work for a whole foods maybe I'll just do that\nAnd just just to clarify again how are you just like sort of funding the spin like binding greens and stuff and and this was when you're using your own money\nYou know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card\nAnd were you nervous or anxious little I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all kinds of green information in a month we'd go by and I would find out about\nA piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things and I would be so motivated and somebody want to buy bars and I make them a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags in a little Chinese takeout box\nAnd and I would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow\nAnd then another month to go by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and then I Would just get really I'm motivated and nothing happened and this went on for the three year period between my idea phase and when actually launched so\nI I'm trying to figure out how you uh maintained your uh your optimism and confident about all this because I mean you're thirty two you're divorced\nI imagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of this plan and I don't well it was part of you [noise] I mean did you ever get the feeling that people look you in ... I think I had a Laura she's got this kind of weird ... project a lot of people thought that\n[noise] I mean did you ever get the feeling that people look you and think oh yeah that's Laura she's got this kind of weird side project a lot of people thought that I mean\nI Would see people I went to high school with and they would come into whole foods and you know they ... they're they're already climbing the ladder big jobs in finance and all kinds of things and they say oh\nOh I didn't know you worked here and and people would see me and even if I had those moments with people were ... I Would notice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life and you have to go for it and embrace it and make it happen\n[noise] when\nWe come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen project into a business [noise] stay with us I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR and [noise]\n[noise]\nThe review is your tickets on music your passport but our journey of the imagination through many legends and ... and ... from ...
