international string competition [noise]\nYou've heard plenty of stole burger medalists on from the top over the years because as we search the country for talented young string players were drawn to this competition and the incredibly gifted badger violinist violist chose and bassist who show up every year in Kalamazoo the home of the stole Burke\nI sat down for a brief conversation with Margaret Hamilton the executive director of the competition after the semi final round to help set the scene\nMargaret tell me briefly the history of the stove or competition and why it's free string players it's really an honor of much below violinist and teacher yes\nYou are so right it's an author of Julius stole Burke who was a long time resident of Kalamazoo music faculty member here at western Michigan University School of music directed the Kalamazoo juniors symphony for decades and died unexpectedly or too soon in Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd it was his family and friends and community members who literally gathered around Esther stole birds kitchen table saying how do we commemorate the life of this man [noise] so they came up with the notion of a competition and\nThey hoped at that point in time that it might last for five years but Julius had extraordinary ties to the greater string community at of course has worked with strings students he was the violin professor at\nWas legendary here so we're just so lucky that that legend lived on much beyond five years\nIt's just an amazing thing so described the process to me you know how many kids apply every year\nThis year we

twelve semi finalists that we heard today how is\nThat even possible I mean you know just you know the proof is in the ... of course the ... that I heard today we're more artist than competitors I think uh so what does that process like or do you have a hair splitting moments you know getting them down from two hundred or is it fairly obvious I mean the the level must be astronomical at\nThis I think the level is astronomical and I'm always grateful that I Am not the person making those decisions are screeners who do remain anonymous they are well versed in the literature and the profession uh in what the field is like\nA there are multiple screeners at each level they listen very carefully they proceed with great integrity but as you can imagine there are some really tough calls made at the end\nAnd what it would win can a kid's apply until how old can they be\nUh our rules call for them to be age Nineteen or under as of January first of the competition here\nSo the kids you work with are very much eligible to appear on from the top as a matter of fact this year there's a large overlap yes\nThere is a huge overlap and I think that's what brought us together and we've noticed that overlap over the years that alumni of from the top also end up being ...\nThere is a huge overlap and I think that's what brought us together and we've noticed that overlap over the years that

bar\nAnd you're and you're you're a blue grass roots yet and folk music roots and how the boat technique in bluegrass tends to be sort of loose and more fluid and don't you think that helps ... yeah I\nThink I'm One of the things\nThat I I think helps with by is the idea of\nHaving a pulse having a beat ... it's so central and folk music is just that the rhythm and the beat and that's something that I feel like can it did its central Limbaugh but it's something that's often underestimated and just keeping that read them and the polls ah\nI think it really helps a lot about how to help the peace come alive\nYeah I think Vivaldi probably his his contemporary was probably even a little bit better with that ... thing really yeah\nA kinetic sense of how that works and I just I just found
