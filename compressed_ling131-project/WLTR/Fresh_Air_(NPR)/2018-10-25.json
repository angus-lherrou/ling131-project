start sending it hurt a lot of politics and not as many as ...\nThank you gentlemen one critique we read we received after last week's debate or is that fewer start that he had heard a lot of politics and not as many specific says they liked her so I encourage you again through a focus on this specific temperature polemic voters who are watching and Italian as our first round of questions\nWell you're both known as lawyers obviously from Columbia actually live not far from each other in downtown Columbia but you also own a other businesses governor you come on twenty rental properties or in Columbia\nRepresentative Smith you operate a disabled veterans owned business that I'm a offers ballet services that veteran affairs hospitals first I Want to ask as small business owners what regulations and taxes need to change to make it easier to get more of an edge to small businesses in South Carolina\nMr Smith first response\nQuestion have a whole lot one I Want to see us adjust our on overall tax burden on businesses I post something on an ax radiate a long time ago and led the fight to make sure\nThat we reduce the taxes on businesses in our state I I Know as governor I'm going to build a type of consensus we need to be more competitive when it comes to taxes in South Carolina I've always supported pro growth tax initiative a particularly those things like they banned a village revitalization act\nAnd the text all male or bottles ... all of which have been a real shot in the arm for businesses and redevelopment and you see it all across our state and that's actually initiative it Henry vetoed and opposed and we had to override his veto but it's an important pro growth tax initiative is made a difference in the future of our state\nUh I also know that uh I Want to make sure that we become more competitive when it comes to our energy South Carolina particularly Columbia just lost a big manufacturer because of our high energy prices and I know as governor I had the ability to make us more competitive\nWere Henry who is certainly been other utilities candidate I think is going to certainly continue to that\nGovernor out the ability to make us more competitive were Henry who has certainly been other utilities candidate I think it's going to certainly continue to defending the status quo\nI don't know what Mr Smith means by the utilities candidate I'm the one that brought everything to lie about the shenanigans going on not only it is the energy or scanner but also the ... the one that brought all that\nTo light and I'm the one that said the painful should not have to pay sent for reactors that are not going to be built they ought to get the money back for what to put in and not spend any more and I think the judge is right on the edge of agree with me on there\nWith the way to get more business is to reduce taxes is reducing this unemployment tax fifty two million years twenty five men and reduce it last year\nFifty two million this year out they keep on reducing our lack of eventually get rid of the corporate income tax I'd like to get rid of the regulations that choke the mechanics and those who work in contract does it work on property keep 'em up the bill they have to ride all over town\nAll over the counter you get the permits just to do simple work there are many things we can do but the main thing to create more businesses is to lower taxes\nReduced regulations that's what I'm for my food is not\nThis week new beach received a bit of criticism for your businesses in news reports\nGovernor McMaster some of your properties or run down including boarding house that we found had mold and roaches in a stove and two properties have received dozens of city code violations representative Smith\nYou've been accused of passing on your business in but then with your business to non qualified subcontractors and your declined Avi A. inspection this year that will prevent you from getting further VA contracts\nShouldn't voters judge you on how you run your business is a government Nasser\nWe're we're full arguments here there's my wife Peggy she she runs the J and properties\nYour businesses um government Nasser\nWell we're we're full arguments here there's my wife Peggy she she runs PJ and properties wherever property management manager but uh where where it for a walk in saying that but not in that particular room in the house\nIs you know students or act like students college students were live on a college campus they break a lot of things we fix them as fast as we can\nUh they ... they ruin houses a little bit different or we we rent to people there it's on a weekly basis that's all they can afford and uh they they a lot of these people would be on the street if we didn't have a place for them there\nIs a it's a it's a nice business we enjoy doing it we're renovating all the time those particular photograph came from things that are on to run a vacation right now what do you think that the\nVoters should judge you want based on on what these news reports I just had\nShot think they I think they should look at everything but I think they should look at the fact that we have a hundred percent occupancy students are waiting in line to to move into the ... and the manager managed to well they're nice properties\nRepresentative Smith Fleming march eighth two thousand and eight out of the vehicle I commanded an ID it blew that truck Scott ... along with several other members that were a part of that truck suffered a permanent injuries\nBecause of that I was able to qualify as a service disabled that aren't on business and each one of those allegations\nWere allegations that we oppose a field in one so the fact is I'm happy for the people of South Carolina the judge me on the business side there's those\nIn the end we won and successfully put back all of those allegations on the other hand I have to go through the inspection well we knew at the end it required that I'd be fulltime engaged in the business and the fact is running a fulltime statewide campaign\nAnd serving as governor you can't do both so it was a voluntarily intent to to let that go and begin winding up that business I'm proud of what what\nAnd ... and you can't do both so it was a voluntarily intent to to let that go and begin winding up that business I'm proud of what we've been able to do on the other hand I don't know if you would even live in the buildings of which you rent\nCountry of veterans in South Carolina Thank\nSix months ago seven inmates died and another Seventeen were injured during a riot at lick league correctional institution one issue advocate for prisoners has raised in the wake of the riot is whether South Carolina is doing enough to give him inmates the tools to improve their lives\nShould South Carolina prisons put more emphasis on rehabilitation or put more emphasis on making prisons more secure in light of what happened six months ago\nOr just for governor math so that\nIs yes we are doing that were making ... what we're doing we're doing both okay\nPure in light of what happened six months ago\nOr just for governor enough so that the answer is yes we are doing that we're making great what we're doing we're doing both okay unfortunately the cell phones have taken over his you know and we've been cases where people have been convicted of running their organizations delivering dope and all sorts of stuff from within the person\nBryan sterling my direct in prisons as as salt and I have salt and be able to jammed those signals from the cell phones we have not get smuggled in oh we have not been allowed to do that but we're continuing to try the mean time\nWe're experimenting with a managed access system the jam some signals that the league correctional institution\nBut also what we've done under his leadership is to provide for workforce development inside the prison as well as medical\nOr a tell tale of medicine and tell a psychiatry also taken those prisoners on their way out and teaching them to scale getting them to learn so they will be able to come out and get a job and is\nBooming economy that we have right now\nIs representative Smith\nHenry cell phones don't murder prisoners like it just doesn't\nWhat what happened there was an extraordinary tragedy that everybody in South Carolina or should be very concerned about the fact that those southern died in such a bled to death because there was nobody there to be able to help them\nAnd Henry if if we want to make sure that we get prisoners back to work one of the ways we have work to do that\nWith our chambers of commerce all of which have supported inexperience meant expungement so the more\nAh offenses nonviolent offense as can be expunged from people's records because the best way to prevent somebody from reinventing is for them to have a job and one of the ways that this ... preventing them from having a job as a as a record and so we all support that Republicans and Democrats in the house the Senate supported this but you'd be you'd be\nFrom having a job is is a record and so we all support that Republicans and Democrats in the house the Senate supported this but you'd be\nYou'd be worrying about your future in your next election not the people of South Carolina and that was governor I'm going to be there for the citizens of our state I'm going to make sure that when we expand the explains that can be available we're going to put more people back to work in South Carolina\nAnd improve the lives of so many that are that are Henry you're standing in a way of bone [noise]\nYou're you're wrong about that that uh that riot was organized by cell phones inside the prison with the president's talking to each other it as a menace all across the country South Carolina's not only state facing there's and we got to get rid of those cell phones their ability to\nTo work um thank you very much thank you gentlemen I've got an\nQuestions related to business here in the upstate the auto manufacturing industries anticipating a downturn or because of President Trump's tariffs and his talents war with China and Europe are certainly we all know we're in your country or in in this part of South Carolina and\nThe question I Will ask you governor is having you've raised this question with the president of response did you get put on the order his task representative Smith first you know you would be a democratic governor with a Republican president a Republican legislature and and a Republican Congress predominantly\nSo what kind of leverage\nFor questions of that sort would you have\nI think a great deal of leverage and I've shown that in twenty two years of service in the general assembly by building bipartisan coalition so dress and focus on some of the biggest challenges facing our state but the fact is is\nTwenty two years of service in the general assembly by building bipartisan coalition so dress and focus on some of the biggest challenges facing our state but the fact is is those job killing terrorists are hurting our state matter of fact South Carolina is one of the third worst farm states when it comes to these terrorists\nBMW alone will lose over three hundred and fifty million dollars this year and over five hundred and fifty million dollars each year to come\nAnd the fact is all we hear from Henry is happy patients\nWill the people of South Carolina the hard working people of South Carolina deserve a better response and the kind of response I'll give us to marshal the support of of the chambers of Congress across our state just so they asked him ready to do but has not happened\nIn Marshall the support of our congressional delegation which I have known and and have experience doing doing in the past when it came to protecting or a coastline\nAnd then you've got to lead governor you've got to knock on the door and knock down the door of the White House to make sure that you protect the hard working people of South Carolina and it wasn't until we held a press conference on element electronics did you finally decided to take action thank you\nRunning for um question and here's your chance to explain how you're knocking down the door but I I have you raised in his ... year with the president and and what's your concern about the impact in South Carolina I'm very concerned about it that far away\nIn constant touch that far James when when when Mr Smith was having a press conference about the terrorist is going to be placed on element which is the only\nTo be manufacturing the United states hours talking to the president to those in the Congress and in the White House to get the terrorists not to have the tariffs place and it was not places you know that's the case or jumping the gun before you know exactly what's gonna happen with these tariffs were under strenuous negotiation\nA place that it was not PlayStation no and that's the case and jumping the gun before you know exactly what's going to happen with these tariffs were under strenuous negotiation period with other countries I support what President Trump is doing and things are changing and we will we need to get stronger\nBut I had told them up to everyone in the administration we've had multiple conversations about this terrorist I told him that and they know my position on and we do not want to have any tariffs it will hurt the people of South Carolina\nAnd our businesses I talked to all of these big businesses that are here although BMW all arrest up\nAnd we we're we're working hard to see to it we're not hurt but in fact allowed to thrive as I knew we can do in South Carolina getting any satisfaction we got satisfaction on element that came very quickly we we did not get satisfaction on Samsung calls him\nIntroducing brain pile into the conversation Samsung ended up getting and I testified against that I testified against others as well\nWhich Samsung was able to enter into smartly research and development agreements with us see in clumps and as a result they're producing the washing machines faster and faster and we'll get out on to that time in many ways to work to to see that the people of South Carolina thrive ask\nI'm going to ask me for a short answer to this question because we're running a little\nAh behind Pacers here we are but similarly last week you met with the president about the uh the ... project of savannah river the modified or the mixed oxide fuel plant which as I understand it as a centrally a dead project are you able to revive and Yes sir how\nWell we have another meeting with President we met with secretary Perry we've met with\nGoodness we met with with everybody and the White House counts\nWell we're gonna have another meeting with the president remember secretary Perry we've met with\nGoodness we met with with everybody in the White House counsel we met we must have had twenty people in the room or just last week and go soft spoken to him about that before I I think that once the facts can be presented to the president\nThe full effect and it's difficult to do\nOr when when you you you don't have the the complete for when you get in a country information from the what is the Obama department of energy there still people there that had this anti nuclear attitude so we're we're working hard I think when we're able to finally finish this fight it will be approved and it'll go ahead\nThank you represented Smith that's that's another project under way over budget way overdue\nIt still absolutely well it you can look at the the sort of a Trump experience with with Henry in South Carolina it's been a big help to Henry's help to survive a primary uh but that friendship is done very little for South Carolina\nOr in fact when you look at the the terrorists were seeing half of the jobs that we thought we would get from volvos are now Henry they're going to China and those lines are going to China because\nYou've been unable to impress upon on behalf of the people are state with the president how wrong this is for the people of of South Carolina the mock programming you think of the billions that was spent uh they are and and the bottom line is is\nIt is a product of which there is no customer\nIt is there was no way for this to end good\nAnd so what we need to do is look about how we save those jobs here in South Carolina how we've turned the resources and the important work that is being done uh they are to to further employ the people of our state and particularly the Asian community which is so important uh to what happens is already in a sentence how do you do that\nWhile I think you have to look at the alternatives because right now what what him he's talking about do is kicking the can and not dealing with the issue or as governor\nWhile I think you have to look at the alternatives 'cause right now what what he's talking about do is kicking the can and not dealing with the issue as governor I'll deal with the issue\nAnd Andy Shane has the next several ... above ...\nThere's a fifty billion dollar market for the mock few if we once we get that plant running fifty billion dollars which is way more way more multiple times more than it will cost\nTo finish it in the facts on our side effects we just need to present them very clearly and that last meeting was not the chance to do that but I promise you I can get in with the president and with secretary Perry and others and bring my team which includes in South Carolina delegation\nSouth Carolina has among the worst health care outcomes but we pay the most forth a that has to change in as governor it it will change a in a matter of fact when we talked about the effort to train more nurses in South Carolina Henry on your watch also our tuition writes\nA for instance there's tons of higher education are now among the highest in the southeast making it harder and harder for our citizens to access to higher education\nAs governor I'm going to fix it I'm going to expand healthcare and our say cup of hundreds of thousands of don't have access to to do it today we're going to support preventative care that's going to drive all the tax the cost of our taxes down for that and I'm going to improve the health of our citizens and then\nI'd never not wants in this entire campaign a proposed a single tax increase now that the only tax increases that I've ever passing my twenty two years in the south on a house had been those sponsored by Republicans that Susan increased\nThere's there's a traditional or or a practice that has been used to relieve nurse shortage for years and that's hiring foreigners we've got schools in this state that are hiring foreign teachers are we're in a part of the states as I mentioned earlier\nWhere German has spoken to some degree or hear it out in the street here we are a state that his reliant on people who are not necessarily\nBorn Americans so I'm concerned\nAbout where you see us with regard to\nImmigration in a state that depends on immigration should we be all worried about this caravan that's getting a lot of attention or should we be much more inclined towards immigration than meets the needs of South Carolina should start with a representative Smith\nAnd towards immigration meets the needs of South Carolina should start with a representative Smith\nHenry this was another one of those areas again there you go again\nYou proposed to eliminate\nSanctuary cities in South Carolina which there are zero [noise]\nHenry I'm when as governor I'm going to focus on real problems not imaginary ones [noise]\nThe reality is if we have two long seeing the politics of division playing on people's fears and hate and prejudice in order to get elected\nDoes a disservice to the people of our state\nAnd I won't have any part of\nThe fact is I Know\nThere are hardworking people out there they're DACA recipients who we need is a part of our workforce\nAnd then er you know most all of the chambers of commerce in our state want to see is allowed and have access to to our institutions of higher education allow them to act have access to the licensing 'cause they're an important part of our community ... matter of fact many of these have never known a their country of origin\nYou know you got to care more Henry\nAbout the people of our state than just keeping this jobs and playing politics with their lives [noise]\nHow do we make immigration more foreign colonel ask Mr Smith is wrong again I never said we will do lemonade sanctuary cities I say we don't ever want to have any\nAnd the only way we can both be should have not to have it is to put teeth and that law because they've been suggestions around the country of not only section where cities sanctuary states so that's what I Want to do is is not have any I don't want to get into that kind of been\nAround the country are not only section where citizens sanctuary states so that's what I Want to do is is not have any I don't want to get into that kind of business because we know in places where there have sanctuary cities crime goes up they have one problem after another and we do not want to have any sanctuary cities in South Carolina now the other thing\nThe way the way to have more\nThe way to have have more\nIs we need to be sure that in our universe is we teach in south Carolinians we have too many students were of a lot in it not so many and some schools but we sometimes forget overloaded\nWith students that come in here to go to our universities and then go back to where they where they came from and take their skills and they're learning to other places I think it USC which is a great school but we're heading towards having too many out of state students those universities of\nOff all the faithful to South Carolina and we want to have we want to have people that will come to South Carolina all there will\nBe south in South Carolina and will stay in South Carolina and use their education here not go elsewhere\nYou call that I'm not sure what that happens at all to do with immigration I don't know I didn't hear anything about the the port in the pool was our institutions of higher education needs to be such that they keep our best talent in the states\nAnd we attract talent from other states and she'll motor spectacular places to live and work and we keep that talent here 'cause we're gonna connecting with economic opportunities when we do and we get that and that's the kind of leadership on them provide as governor and\n[noise]\nThat's our next round with a question to Mr Smith\nAbout Fifteen miles from where the winning one point five billion dollar lottery tickets all the um [noise] I wouldn't be here sorry [laughter]\nIt was all the um [noise] I wouldn't be here sorry [laughter]\nSouth Carolina could get as much as sixty one point five million dollars if as expected the winner take the lump sum payment what do you think the legislature ought to do with the windfall representative Smith\nWhile this is an area that uh you know it'll certainly be a windfall but what we have to do is one time money and then as you always have to be fiscally responsible when it comes to one time money by making sure that you don't committed to her current age\nWe certainly have a lot of one time needs in South Carolina or whether it be some infrastructure needs or some of our schools have deferred maintenance costs are but I Would work closely as I have done for the past twenty two years with the leadership in the house in the Senate on both sides of the aisle to set priorities that the support\nI Can't say what those would be right now the top of my head I I Know there are a lot of them but I'd worked the important thing is is\nA governor in South Carolina simply can't do that because they chose choose to do it you have to take and work with the members of the general assembly to do that and I've seen the history of being able to do to do that and that's what I Would do\nThere's nothing on the on the top of your list on I'll make it a speaker and the president ...\nWhat would it be I I think there are a lot of a desperate need certainly in our schools in the nineties I Would look at brick and mortar projects to be a priority awesome infrastructure needs to help move our state for it\nAs quickly as possible governor McMaster same question and I'll put you in the same position you you you can\nI Would dictate a number of things one uh one is it a ... hour would not be in a hurry to immediately spend an extra money that comes in and this is we always want more money coming in and want to be growing every\nEvery year and that's that's why we have surpluses over the recent years and that is a result of a good business environment which will be ruined by higher taxes and regulations and coddling unions\nSix years and that is a result of that good business environment which would be ruined by higher taxes and regulations and coddling unions and those kind of thing but the one thing that stands out as a pension reform\nWe have in our pitch and this is a contract with me that all workers that are on that pension and that's not just the state workers but many in the ...\nAs well and is is that oh we have a twenty billion dollar oh unfunded liability or the control of general ekstrom\nI Believe says there's more than ... maybe twice that that would be a good place to consider\nWhich something on the top of the list now those people that are suffering from the hurricane and from the floods in the ... all the way from draw down to con way down to soccer is the books port and all in that area it would be is slow to get that federal money in is slow to get those things done we're moving\nFaster and faster but it would be very beneficial if we could find some way with great accountability and precision to see that that money would go to help\nThem and those pensions will be at the top of your list or ... or the entrance to the doctor a lot of money\nThat would be I'd cut in half I think if I were the dictator out you know you have to have priorities we have a lot of needs in South Carolina from rose to teacher salaries to all sorts of things we have to take take as well as low info\nOn government master out that the next question starts which you should we because of the success that we've seen from the from the lottery should we allow other types of gambling in South Carolina sports betting is illegal nationally\nWhat about casinos what's your notes on that\nI don't think so I and I remember this debate started years ago\nAnd Cal Campbell who is that did a great job as governor of South Carolina uh made the point that we don't want to be dependent on gambling there's plenty of room and he was exactly right for good solid businesses that are going to last that are not going to be\nThe dependent on gambling there's plenty of room and he was exactly right for good solid businesses that are going to last that are not going to be a continuing influenced by a women's or anything to be unpredictable to build it on good solid business\nAnd he and other leaders or successful in bringing BMW under South Carolina and that has been the beginning of a a run of successes and then as I said if you've heard me before and the last\nJust two years we broken all records were twenty three billion dollars in New investment twenty three thousand new jobs eight billion dollars in you and that is the way to have a steady clean predictable source of income\nComing in in through taxes for the people of a state representative Smith should\nBe allow other kinds of gamble while I think by virtue of court decision we know online particularly sports gambling is coming in is already here or an hour to orange and I think what needs to be done is make sure it's highly regulated\nOr so that we make sure that we protect the citizens are say who are already exposed to that and it's a we it'd be highly regulated because it's going to be there when I was there today and I'm sure there's Robin ...
