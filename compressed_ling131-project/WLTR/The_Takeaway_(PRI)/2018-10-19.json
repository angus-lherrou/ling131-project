Felix Mendelssohn and his ... number one actually is just as ... had an e flat major above twenty\nAnd you know people often talk about Mozart integrate child prodigy which he absolutely was and several other composers but really a mini have also said that when you look at Mendelssohn and you look at the absolute equality of his words he may have been one of the\nUm best child prodigy in terms of the sheer talent that he had at such a young age and many people have commented on his works whether this ... or ... or to A Midsummer Night's Dream\nAnd said you know this is an distinguishable from something in adult might have written it's truly that level of quality that top notch so\nIt's an inspirational work and again I ask you to consider donating and making these

not only treating yourself to more programming that you depend on here programming that\nMight form the backdrop to your daily routine or maybe one of the highlight of it but you're also supporting this programming for other people in the Palmetto State perhaps for some young musicians who a tune in to get a little inspiration for their own\nUm competition with their own budding careers so you can you can think about that and and be moved to know that you may just be shaping the future career of someone like Felix Mendelssohn or someone like that to return to now\nActually composure fairly connected to Mendelssohn not just because they were German composers but middle son famously\nBrought about this event known as the Bach Revival in Eighteen twenty nine with performance of the St Matthew's passion now\nSome people would really looked at that say well you know this flame that was the music of Johann Sebastian Bach or just Sebastian Bach when he was often called at that time it never really died out\nIt was still going this whole time there were um people like the salon hostess ... lady intact middle son's grandmother ancestor of some sort\nWho cultivated in curated box music in her personal music library and some of the musicians you would have over at her salons would perform these works so there was a block tradition\nKind of underground before medals and came along but then failings medals and really brought it to the surface with that performance at the St Matthew's passion so\nCertainly I think um we Mendelssohn a dead of some sort they're for bringing our attention to Bach just like we're\nMatthew passions so certainly I think um we of mental scent of a dead of some sort they're for bringing our attention to Bach just like we're pretty much indebted to you for bringing the attention of south Carolinians to classical music to this huge and varied\nA collection of works that spans centuries countries backgrounds you name it what genre of music is really does doesn't even do to call it a genre I think it's just so broad says thank you for your support\nAnd for helping to make this music possible\nAgain if you'd like to donate and give

minor\nAnd with the three other cats will sweets it's definitely by at his more like music ... not quite by the serious a few writing I'm deeply sacred minded composer in these sweeps this is him taking it easy a bit more\nHe uh didn't quite explore this genre as much as some of his contemporaries that that may give an indication of where some of his interests were but of course when he did he really knocked out of the part no surprise there\nAnd this particular sweet or the VW the ten sixty seven may have had its first performance at this coffeehouse known as the cafe summer I'm On a little little place where box perhaps after dealing with the stresses of writing a can tata every week for the St Thomas church and then\nDealing with some of the behavior problems we can surmise might have occurred time and again at a school that was attached to that church where he might have taught Latin\nThat this cafe provided a little get away for him a chance to socialize to try out a few few different words outside of his his\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Martin Perlman leading the Boston Baroque therefore Johann Sebastian box will Castro sweet and number two and be minor finishing with that famous ... movement essentially\nThat not joking around a lot of chests here and I think a short little piece very fun when that should completely eliminate any idea that minor in music has to be sad I mean that peace is just pure fun pure jest as the title would go\nBut I'm coming to you now not in the spirit of just split in seriousness because well we're in our life pledge drive mood now
