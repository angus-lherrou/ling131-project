Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep the historian Hampton Sides has been exploring the origins of the u._s. conflict with North Korea he's written a history of Americans in a brutal battle\nAnd when Americans try to unify north and South Korea\nThey still don't have to radio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise]\nNorth Korea that started the war invading the U.S back south the United states and its allies struck back with this landing commanded by one of the arrows most famous general\nDouglas MacArthur his landing works as this old movie newsreel proclaimed\nThe war and read the turning point I was a fire started and certainly move all the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan that MacArthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans that threat and a huge Chinese army will soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but didn't intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug what\nWas the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealized that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nNone of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou give an incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on\nYou know this is Hector calf Retta who received the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night you may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never kill demand for I'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nTwenty thousand factories are Josephine reservoir slog than there are ways to fix the bitter miles to the evacuation point devote enough to snow mountain passes they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot\nThey had a different perspective on this story we just heard you focus on one particular Korea and leave by silk who was\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escape to the south moved just soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reached soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered you had to hide out in a house in Seoul he hid\nUntil American forces entered the city blasting to ruins as they took it back\nThought the capital city of Seoul [noise]\nMedium we volunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter in a guard in the very city that he had grown up in in North Korea ham Han\n... experiences as an American interpreter in the north\n[noise] he was assigned to guard a bridge in his hometown a bridge they called the bridge of long life and he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment\nOr was on the other side of the bridge of long life and that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south lead\nBy ... survived the war and immigrated to the United states he is now Dr Lee by sort of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book\nBecause this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law what is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump but everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a work could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there is such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship\nHampton Sides is the author of on desperate ground the Marines at the reservoir\nAnd the Korean War graves battle thanks very much rate to be with you\nThis is NPR News says is not important nine do to be you are coming up the death toll from

Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the ... case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons or any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not with FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but\nThat doesn't mean we should investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this oh fender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI ...

politicians are I think it's bad enough that senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing a thing [noise] what is the manner in which you could have defended himself\nThat would have left him on tainted\nThink it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passionate about it\nBut he's behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era where not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from ...\nJudge would be shocked um so I think uh you know there was a way for him to make his case\nAnd in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if a Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats what do you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody make him\nA ... no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would filed motions to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument or if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I that I Do know that I Would make that argument that far but ... like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and over again I'm right\nThere I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at she'll be American Constitution society thanks so much and\nKeep a new State Department visa policy declared that

B. U. R. fall fundraiser tomorrow between now and then\nWe've had a great morning so far but between now and then we still need to raise four hundred eighty thousand dollars it's been a great morning because people are taking advantage of the match that's on the table generous listeners saying that they will match every pledge today for a little while\nSo that uh there is so that uh if it because they want to encourage you to give your money as well so that everybody is behind the news on WB you are\nProtecting the independence of WB you are protecting independent journalism on WB you are so take advantage of that yourself have your ten or Fifteen or twenty dollar a month to pledge from W. B. U. R. doubled\nFor every month of the next year or have that hundred or two or that thousand or two dollar pledge that we hope you'll give in the next couple of minutes be doubled doesn't matter what the amount is only matters that you become a contributing listener the pledge line\nIs one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or you can give at W. B. U. R. dot or\nYou know it might seem like it would be easier if we just got a few or a few dozen or a few hundred\nDeep pockets to fund WB you are but that would be the shareholder model and that would mean that we would ultimately have to serve their interests so this is a different model this is the independent journalism listener supported radio model not for profit model\nThousands of people contribute each year to W. B. U. art amounts of ten dollars a month twenty dollars a month sometimes a thousand or a few thousand but it is mostly smaller donations and that is how you create and protect independent journalism\nNo better time to do your part toward that goal then right now during the first last in only dollar for dollar match for the entire fall fundraiser and here's the thing other listeners have already been doing their part this morning they have taken about half of the matching money off the table\nYes she does and and on the stand insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective\nUm that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot of things that that he said the dashcam video can't see like McDonald's face and his and he describes his ...\nYou know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke and then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonald turning toward him with and waving and nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar or for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a\nReasonable officer would have done in that moment\nAnd so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he's needed to convince the jury of his that he was reasonably and fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be and fear for his wife likes that look on his face or\nThe turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nAnd I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court Roger ... through the first two weeks of trial or do you think the end I was going to take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um well you really have to testify out top or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to bring it home from the jury we also heard from a lot of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWill have to cross examination go well\nUm when bombs or Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he described the shooting when he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nVan Dyke to not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nIt as an initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually describe in great detail alleged movements by requirement Donald the wave of the knife raising the knife and and it described officer Van Dyke backpedaling from McDonalds none of those things are on the dash cam video\nPatrick Smith of member station WBFO easy in Chicago is covering this trial and his reporting
