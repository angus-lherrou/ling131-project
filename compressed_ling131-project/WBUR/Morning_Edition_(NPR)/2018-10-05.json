four the patronize three and two on the season\nWith us this morning without much sleep is ESPN dot coms Mike ... talked about the game good morning Mike and thanks for coming in\nGood morning thanks for having me so I have to say I watched a good chunk of the first half of the game last night Thursday games are pretty challenging since both the colds are and the patriots play just a few days earlier last Sunday but the patriots seem very well prepared\nYeah as a patriots fan you saw the part of the game that you wanted to see ah they were excellent and the first half opening up at twenty four to three lead at half time and then they slipped a little bit in the third quarter but if they can play like they did in the first half they're going to be just fine the rest of the season\nLet me ask about Julian Edelman first came back for the season the patriots top wide receiver you served a four game suspension for use of a performance enhancing substance of fans in teammates said pretty much eagerly awaited his return and he was happy to see all of them here's what he said last night\nAnd play football and ... I think it was like four or five days or something like that so it was good to be out there in front of the crowd there rock and they're often seen all of them was was amazing so it was just great to be back\nSo from your point of view was he good he was very good and he created a lot of energy for both the patriots and the fans\nAh one of the great visuals have last night was when the patriots were announced to come onto the field before the game Julian Edelman let them out of the tunnel and he just sprinted Bob from one end zone\nTo the other and sort of leaped up in the air and pumped his fifth and the crowd really roared and then he ... the first half of the game they really wanted to get them involved fairly\nAlright how about TV twelve a quarterback Tom Brady he threw his five hundred career touchdown pass last night he looked pretty good too\nDid a historic night just to third player in NFL history to throw for five hundred touchdown passes\nUm and and so that was impressive and also set another record by doing it to ... throwing a touchdown to Seventy one different players no one has ever thrown it to that many players at least one touchdown pass Seventy one different players touchdown passes to them wow that's pretty\nYou're gonna wish me and he also talks about how that means he's played a long time [laughter] let me\nUh ask this question or as we pointed out the ... look really good in the first half they only gave up three points to the field goal by a Adam ... on the cold side but in the second half it was a little bit of a different story what happened then should concern us\nWell what happened was that the patriots didn't have the ball security Tom Brady through a couple of nights passes one too wide receiver Chris Hogan and ... and Chris Hogan couldn't catch it sort of popped up in the air and the colds intercepted it and then later in the third quarter a similar situation a path to Rob Gronkowski\nOr that the big tighten normally would would bring in but instead it's sort of bad it up in the air and the Colts intercepted that one as well\nAnd it was a good reminder to the patriots that when they don't secure the ball they get a little bit sloppy or the other team gets turned over those can be a great equalizer and keep the other team in the game on it is a concern because the patriots can't play like that against better teams if they expect to win All right next a next time they\nPlay which would be about a week and a half they play the chiefs are in their next game ... out of the chief slogan and what's the long lay off a lot of the patriots to do\nWell Bill Belichick gave the players three straight days off players were very happy about that so they get to rest up he'll up some of their injured players and the Kansas City chiefs Bob and one of the best teams in the NFL they're one of two undefeated teams heading into this weekend\nGreat offensive team they the scored more points than anyone in the

the court doesn't dwell too long and the many highlights of the red Sox season throughout the summer of course says he made one message clear\n... there's a bigger picture than just one day during the

a\nIn a relaxed environment they don't know it but they know that sometimes you know it's better to talk baseball why we're playing cards you know or or talking about their families and where they are a lot of individuals when you're over there and their environment\nBut it takes more than great communication skills to get the best record in baseball there is also corps ability to balance is

page to and that contributes to the kind of chemistry necessary to be as consistent as the red Sox have been they didn't have a losing streak longer than three games during the regular season and that happened only four times\nThe players they like to be GM's delight to be managers they liked the owners of the team that they they know what's going on and if they feel that there's no we're not in

I think it was like four or five days or something like that so it was good to be out there in front of the crowd there in Iraq and they're awesome you know seeing all then was was amazing so great to be back\nSo from your point of view was he good he was very ...\nGee for both the patriots and the fans\nAh one of the great visuals of last night was when the patriots were announced that come onto the field before the game Julian Edelman lead them out of the tunnel and he just sprinted Bob from one end zone\nTo the other and sort of leaped up in the air and pumped his fifth and the crowd really roared and then he ... the first half of the game they really wanted to get them involved nearly\nAll right how about TV twelve a quarterback Tom Brady he threw his five hundred career touchdown pass last night he looked pretty good too\nHe did a historic night just to third player in NFL history to throw for five hundred touchdown passes um and and so that was impressive and also set another record by doing it to ... throwing a touchdown to Seventy one different players no one has ever thrown it to that many players at least one touchdown\nPass Seventy one different players touchdown passes to them well that's pretty ah that that's pretty significant complement he also talks about how that means he's played a long time [laughter]\nLet me uh asked this question or as we pointed out the ... really good in the first half they only gave up three points to the field goal by a ... on the cold side but in the second half it was a little bit of a different story what happened then should concern us\nWell what happened was that the patriots didn't have the ball security Tom Brady through a couple of nights passes one too wide receiver Chris Hogan and ... and Chris Hogan couldn't catch it it sort of popped up in the air and the colds intercepted it and then later in the third quarter a similar situation a pass to Rob Gronkowski\nOr that the big tighten normally would would bring in but instead it's sort of bad it up in the air and the Colts intercepted that one as well\nAnd it was a good reminder to the patriots that when they don't secure the ball they get a little bit sloppy or the other team gets turnovers those can be a great equalizer and keep the other team in the game and it is a concern because the patriots can't play like that against better teams if they expect to win\nAll right next a next time they play which would be about a week and a half they play the chiefs are in their next game I ... out of the chief slogan and what's the long lay off a lot of the patriots to do well Bill Belichick\nGave the players three straight days off players were very happy about that so they get to rest up he'll up some of their injured players and the Kansas City chiefs Bob or one of the best teams in the NFL they're one of two undefeated teams heading into this weekend\nGreat offensive team they've they've scored more points than anyone in the NFL so that really has a chance to be a marquee matchup a week from Sunday so it's their biggest challenge yet in season no question about it\nMy Greece covers the New England patriots for ESPN dot com and provides regular analysis for WVU our news in a week and a half looking forward to it thanks so much [noise]\nIn the home of Boston's largest radio news rum Ninety two point seven ... eighty nine point one WB wage Brewster and streaming W.
