he cast the votes for or against judge Kavanaugh in purely partisan terms here's what he said so\nSome great things happening but a vote for judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless and outrages tactics of the Democratic party mean obstruction mean resist ... for the last Eighteen months\nSo there is some confusion however about what exactly is going to be investigated the Senate Judiciary committee said the investigation would be limited to quote current credible allegations so what does that mean\nIs the investigation going to look into the accuracy of Kavanaugh's testimony that's unclear Donald Trump has denied that he's put any limitations on the FBI he said the investigators have free reign but this is not a criminal probe it's merely an additional background checks

the patch need to keep the momentum going\nWe haven't played well last week saying you know we talk a lot about the things we need to do better and we need to carry more from week to week so this

Reese good morning Mike good morning by of everything is right again in New England [laughter]\nIt was almost like Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde we've had the evil Mr hyde for a couple of weeks and yesterday we got the smart or a doctor Jekyll patch really turned it around there were struggling on off into defense last week but shined on both sides of the ball yesterday why was that well\nThey did and and one of the players Devon ... he told the story after the game that Tom Brady was in the locker room and said it feels great to be two in two and and you never think the patriots would want to be too into but after they played so poorly\nThe last two weeks just to get back to that sort of level ground they felt really good about and and I would say if you want to highlight one thing they started faster so they were able to play the game more on their terms\nAll right let's talk about uh the defense right now are they allowed just one touched down very late in the game they didn't allow the dolphins within forty five yards of the end zone until the fourth quarter how they\nThat well one of the big things that they did was they played better on early down so they stopped the run and they got back to fundamentals and when Miami had to get a first down they had a long way to go buy them in their first\nEat plays I think they needed ... yards or more to get a first down and when you put a team in that situation it really allows you to dictate the terms\nOf the play and they were able to pressure them and really over match them in the game defensive stand out for the parents will there were a few but I Would say Kyle's van noir linebacker and and there was one play in the second quarter that\nReally sort of reflected that and it was a bad snap by the Miami Dolphins and the ball was on the ground in the Miami Dolphins quarterback ... really looked like he had the ball in Cairo, Illinois just never relented he came right in jumped on him and really took\nAgain the patriots just wanted a little bit more\nAll right back off and uh the patch made plays both throwing the ball and running the ball tell us about the improved running game and the performance of their rookie running backs Sony Michel\nSony Michel finished with one hundred twelve yards on twenty five carries with one touched down and really the story here is that you can't produce like that if you don't have good blocking upfront and it's not just the running back\nIt's those big offensive linemen and they got back to playing or the the way they know where they can play they blocked a lot better so he was a a stand up with thirty three offensive snaps and then you had the old standby James White\nWho had two touchdowns one rushing one passing it running back as well and uh you know he played forty snaps and he's one of their best players that NATO\nAll right Tom Brady a pass for two hundred Seventy four yards but still ... some on the receiving a with receivers he\nDid he's still looking to get comfortable you know it doesn't seem like it's a Tom Brady you know from start to finish that were used to seeing but it certainly was good enough he finished twenty three of thirty five for two hundred Seventy four yards with three touchdowns\nIn two interceptions I'm One of the big storylines was him getting comfortable with the new target\nJosh Gordon who played Eighteenth apps and he's going to really help the patriots he looked OK yesterday he he really did he gave them a lot of energy to catches for thirty two yards and and he just gave him another option you know that's one thing that has stood up to the first three games of the season prior to this one\nThey just seem limited they need more options to throw too on our fence and he sits right next to Tom Brady in the locker room and he said after the game that he really appreciates the support and love the radius given him as he tries to get his career and really his life back on track\nWe're funded by you

along with us here Mara Liasson what did you hear there\nWell what I heard was that a senator Coons laid down the criteria for what would satisfy him and my thought was that doesn't really matter if it satisfies any Democrats\nThe only thing that matters is is the process this week long investigations satisfies Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake who are the three moderate Republicans who wanted this\nPause something the president and\nA leader Mitch McConnell and Kavanaugh himself didn't want but the mass is that the Republicans can afford to only lose one vote and you have senator Collins saying it's very quote reassuring to the public that we're doing this investigation he's\nUm she said it shows Republicans want to make sure we have all the facts to make an informed decision

high gear so or the social media operations full of mind games and fall Suddes things that marred the twenty sixteen election campaign NPR's Tim Mak has been asking\nHow people can protect themselves the online social media world in many ways is an illusion\nThe Senate intelligence committee recently heard from an expert who testified there is twenty five to thirty times more fake information from automated accounts on the extreme left in the extreme right then there is genuine real life conversation\nAnd with the mid term elections just around the corner experts are bracing for a spike in foreign disinformation we're going to have an October surprise that spread brewing who during the Obama administration worked at the national Security Council on how to respond to Russia's efforts to spread false information during the invasion of Ukraine\nIs not a question in my mind of whether it's going to happen it is a crushing only of when and how large\nThe government and America's intelligence agencies have traditionally been more capable in tracking cyberattacks and espionage\nBut the Russian online influence operations during the twenty sixteen elections were done All right there in the open something that caught American spies and law enforcement off guard here's Victoria Nuland a top State Department official during the Russian interference campaign and twenty sixteen testifying before Congress\nThere was a tendency in the U.S intelligence community to look only at classified information so we were as a government not as aware of what was happening in the private sector\nNow Americans won't be caught off guard like they were then but we still need to Wade through the sludge of our online news environments and be smarter about the information we read and I'd just here's April ... who's the head of intelligence law at the national Security Agency that's been\nSocial science research demonstrating that if I tell you some really outrageous proposition something that's clearly an chair I tell you you know it came this guy is green today the first time I say you can't say that you take us it's the dumbest thing I've ever half\nThe next time I say you're going to be more inclined to believe that and by the third or fourth or fifth time it starts sounding almost possible\nA big problem is the nature of the Internet which allows foreign actors to pretend to be Americans reading real information here's Kevin Mandiant the c._e._o. of cybersecurity firm FireEye\nIs an unbelievably complex challenge for a free society especially with the anonymity of the Internet to really police you know the ideas that you're reading the ideology or reading and who the true source of those ideas are\nRafi Krikorian joined the Democratic National Committee and twenty Seventeen to be the lead on cybersecurity and has given some serious thought about how to combat misinformation\nWhen I Would tell my father to do is to actively just look for a living with a view should understand what the opposition to win the might be in like a used data in putting your own head to try sort through what's going on\nUltimately the biggest recommendation from experts in online disinformation campaigns is to diversify your new sources and remain skeptical the germ that we use is digital resilient that's ...\nWho leads the Atlantic council's digital forensics research lab of a degree of critical thinking where if you see something that's overly a motive or\nYou know it doesn't seem quite right check another source just do some basic kind of legwork on your own to
