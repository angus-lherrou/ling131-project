City California let's continue our series on how China is trying to influence the world this is being felt across the globe today in many ways\nBut what China's leaders really want is to shape how the world perceives their country they're devoted massive resources to this and the center of these efforts to shape perceptions is China Supreme leader himself Xi Jinping NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Beijing on cheese message and his media [noise]\nThe China Daily as the country's biggest English language newspaper by circulation\nI met with some of their young journalists recently at a cafe outside their headquarters they has to be identified only by their English first names as they weren't authorized to speak to foreign media one of them Gary said that no matter what's going on president Xi Jinping is always at the top of the news in fact\nHe says that's a rule that the government's mobile news app which China Daily runs ... using residency and paying always comes first he says and Premier League ... we always come second that's not to say that they make news every day\nBut even if they don't their new stays in the top two positions another journalist named Miranda says

from what I see there's a lot more important than his family life compared to previous leaders but\nBehind the feel good coverage she's use of the media has helped him to consolidate his own political

afford it but new show you know media scholar of communication University of China in Beijing\nArgues that China needs to focus on a main character to tell a story effectively and she is that character\nOn the job to hunt down I'm going to leave but she we call her leader promoter in chief of the nation's public image himself takes this very seriously\nChina began taking its image building very seriously before Xi Jinping became president new traces this back to the two thousand and eight Beijing Olympics he says that many Chinese felt that foreign media criticism of their pollution and human rights record spoil their moment in the world spotlight\n... down at the we felt or ability transmitter views was inadequate we're unable to speak up\nSince then China has poured billions of

... argues that China's story ended so example of high speed economic growth is found more receptive audiences in many developing countries\nWe should think about the broader picture that many other countries would still probably continue to see China as strong global actor and potential partner and investor and all of those things\nBut independent analyst Wu Tang says that China is having a hard time coming up with ideas that appealed to western audience says that's partly because ... says the Communist Party is publicly rejected universal values which argues don't fit China\nMobile's Google News of ways and means we'll see all the November\nChina's leader publicly opposes everything from civil society to freedom and democracy that gives them very little room to express themselves\nIf

China now its report on China and influenced the world\nThis model doesn't make it explicit but it's clear from China's media policies that their intent is not just the shape of the world in a way

have the money it takes to pay for the news and the months ahead\nWe still need to raise three hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars\nIt sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but already in the last half hour or so we've raised almost ten thousand dollars so we can do it\nIf you choose to get involved right now if you choose to get behind the news that you listen to all the time here on WB you are if you choose to place rock pledge right now and have your money go further thanks to the last match of this fundraiser last match and it is\nNot going to last very long because we are

WB you are not just this month but for a whole year that's how it works when you give a monthly contribution it's matched for a whole year\nIf you give a one time gift to say a hundred or five hundred or a thousand or five thousand that is also worth fifty percent more\nBut we are going to run out of the match you money very quickly this morning so to jump on this while you still can all you have to do is take two or three minutes at the most right now and call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven\nThree hundred and fourteen thousand dollars left to raise now you can also pledged W.

R. dot org or you know there are a lot of organizations out there there are a lot of\nEnterprises that are really wonderful things were really proud of\nAn emotional so I guess if you did commit an act of sexual misconduct assault or otherwise we was in high school or college do you believe that would be disqualifying should be disqualified\nI think that would depend on um what I mean I\nGuess essentially if the if it really depends there's so many degrees and I think now we're in a day where\nYou know times are a little bit different than they were back then and what those accusations work but um I think you have to look at the entire life of somebody not something they did as a teenager um you know back in those days there was certainly a drinking a beer that's when you're doing these kinds of things and and stuff that\nUm [noise] you have to ... an incident in high school it's kind of um\nTo believe that at this level of of our federal government that that's what we're looking at to try and disqualify somebody from disposition let me ask you as a result of the public debate over this we're seeing more ...\nTill assault just yesterday former CBS News anchor Connie Chung wrote an op ed about her own salt fifty years ago when she was a college student there have been numerous of these testimonials coming out [noise] what do you make of them as someone who defends Brett Kavanaugh who was at the center of all this\nWell I I think that\nSomeone one woman's experience or or because there are other experiences and certainly women have um had these assault experiences and we know that they go unreported and a lot of cases and things like that but that does it on its own on its face doesn't make Brett Kavanaugh or any man\nGuilty of doing what they say they don't I mean in our country we have due process and you are supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and this situation has been the complete opposite of that where he was presumed innocent based on a single accusation starting with it being anonymous\nThen it would be accusation had to face in the name to it\nThan there were four witnesses hall who could not corroborate that story\nBut have you ever had any friends who had this happen to them just people in your life who have suffered a sexual assault I'm sure that I Do yeah and how many men do you know who's ever been falsely accused\nI don't they haven't told me that who they're accuser who they're accusing so I Know it's a very small percentage but that does it's about I think ten percent of the cases I think that the data shows it just doesn't mean\nThat Brett Kavanaugh is guilty because Ninety percent of the men who are accused are guilty ... there are men who are accused of things and they're not guilty and we can look at UVA can look at um a visit to Duke lacrosse\nYou know there are instances and frankly this one is a very public one um the timing of this was incredibly suspect um there's a lot of holes in the stories of I'm Dr Ford there's Ramirez is barely credible to New York times as you know do everything operate any of it\nKnowing women who have endured this you know that there are eight is common to have holes in one's memory that you can't recount necessarily The Elders\nHoles are one thing but lies or other things I mean\nI'm you know fear of flying not true the second door on the house um again that the data they the history shows that was that you like indoor has been on for years before the therapy session that apparently was about\nThis incident there are a lot of things like I said in the testimony that Rachel Mitchell did not follow up on that ah you know now are coming out after the fact\nIn the fact that we know holes in her story we we do not know it is true that we don't have conclusive evidence either way may never we never but I just wonder including is there any part of you that wonders what if I'm wrong what if he did do\nNo there actually isn't um and it's just not enough in our country to make an accusation against somebody anybody for any job any position um or just for their life\nWithout having some cooperation um you know maybe the lesson is that women if these things happen to you need to either report them confide in somebody\nUm something like that so that you know you have a strong case but uh that's not the case here um and and all three of these instances one who was much more salacious and the next there is no cooperation\nWe have to leave it there but we appreciate your sharing your thoughts ... missing a big old car ...
