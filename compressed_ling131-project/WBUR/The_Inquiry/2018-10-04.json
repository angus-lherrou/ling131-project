I I Know there was consistent work the entire time what that didn't have much room for school\nWhen the family needed more money she take more time of school so she could uno and when the family moved to follow the crops she'd move with them [noise]\nOne you should change school full time so she did bonding her exams but Churchill she thought this was ... it wasn't until the filmmaking made a documentary about her she realized she was different from other kids\nAnd to see a room filled with about Fifteen hundred people\nOr story is mind bottling it was crazy that I was being nowhere and has to something that I didn't even know was a problem\nAnd that and that's when I realized that it was a problem in that way I was living was there not the way everyone loved\nThat was the first time she has the tongue child labor and she realized it describes a that was seven years ago now she has made it to university which she's an activist on child labor campaigning in support of the ban\nI definitely feel like children shouldn't be able to work until the age is at least the sixteen I think this is dangerous for the safety of these children in their education and I know there's a lot of people like me out there\nAre some people say well surely is rice if you'll if someone goes to school and just a couple of hours in the evenings or perhaps a couple of hours that we can to help get them income would not be All right [noise]\nUh [noise] the ... never any debatable I Know these families want their children and worked to bring some income and but they're just hindering their education and I think that these families also need to find a different way to get around their situation\nDo you think you would have been able to go to school if you and your siblings hadn't works\nOh absolutely my two younger sisters still live at home\nThey've never felt like they had to go out in the field to work enough because you know my family moved on to a different\nType of job that provided more for us\nSo it sounds like you're saying it's almost as though you need to protect these children from bad choices they might make for the best reasons\nRight I feel like these children shouldn't feel obligated does that make sense [noise]\nWhen Leno was little she felt she have to work she felt responsible even at the age of seven\nSo she says most should be done to list that responsibility of the shoulders of children like a [noise]\nAn onto the parents to find another way to ban helps do that that's her argument\nThat the some of the poorest families in the world that is no other way [noise]\n\nHobby for book we can and cannot do\nMeet India\nWe have been able to actually create religious which have been tried label free by addressing all of the issues in the video conferencing ... to ... to create communities really love to do labor of children simply goes a week that's can be to rotten\nThem should be working on child labor issues in India for the ... the years and she's now director of advocacy and fundraising it's concerned for wasn't children that's\nA charity the bucks and Bangalore charity that says the ban on child labor isn't working\nThere is a lot of fishing in countries like mine to insist that easily child labor any more and more sick to sort of leading export to the idea is to say that these broad except clean they're not touched by hands of child labor\nBecause if that scene is connected with child labor they wouldn't get any money for them they wouldn't be able to sell them\nExactly we don't even acknowledge their presence\nSo when the authorities come across child labor as she says that instead of helping them they will live to dissipate in\nAnd you're choosing a phone working the state's response is come in white ... put them in and take them over ... ... homes within locked up that you know the way from their families and the state caused the family and doesn't the charge would never ever be seen like this again\nAnd when they're released most of the children go back to work because the problems that drove them to work in the first place I haven't been solved and this is what could be threatened his organization comes in they meet child labor is an advantages and a thin that parents why they want\nSome talks about the whole meal they get to the factory some said they didn't get the support they need it at school others said they had to look up to the younger siblings so fetch water all of them had different reasons but they had one thing in common\nThey would not willing to transfer the burden on to the family for instance if they were fishing waters that they would not give it to seeing that your mother fish water and you'd be in school because they were seeing my mother has a lot to do ...\nThey have to find solutions that wouldn't put more pressure on their parents and so it could be threatened us charity tend to what's known as the hunt chance India's local councils\nAnd a lot of the work of my organization has been to walk with these local governments which she lives in sitting with them and the solutions in one case can be a scholarship for the child who has no money\nIt could be more funding for ... Ken so children don't have to the cost of the younger siblings\nAnd then other kids of each year for another child\nElectricity for house once we don't have it and that is how\nWe were able to create try to label the communities in a country like India\nAnd by labor free she doesn't mean these are communities when no children look what she means is that the what they're doing now along the interface with school like\nType ... and she says some what can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks so school uniform about making sure they can choose the right kind of work and to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with to be talked to children and actually come up with a document called work we can and cannot do for instance\nMilking the cows most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids said if you're making what according to the coast which are very ... implement do and which are very happy kicking these and nobody should be doing it because it's hard for look it's dangerous\nInstead of lists drawn up by international organizations or central governments\nThey find out what the children want some might be exhausted by hours of household chores besides to spend two islets working for a local shop others might choose factory what if a milking temperamental Jersey cow it's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nThat can you really expect children to meet the right decision for themselves\nI'm yet to find a child who really wants to be exploited\nThat a child to perhaps continues to walk because they feel the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give the child that choice in fact this kind of work actually increases our responsibility when they're working with children die that you don't let them take that one decision and then forget them you're still in touch with them you're part of their life\n[noise] dinner washing the children's council throughout bind a little it's time consuming and expensive\nBut it's having results so is it time to rethink the ban on child labor [noise] the Iowa and the organization behind the global band says no children under a certain age should never what\nWe heard about the unintended consequences children pushed into more dangerous was called ... by the authorities it's debatable continue\nBut when you take a step back it's clear that the argument isn't just about policy\nIt's about something real fundamental some particularly in the\nWest a child under a certain age who works is by definition being exploited others say a child should have the right to walk\nAnd that's what makes it so hard to know what's right [noise]\nDancer doesn't lying on a definition of child labor it's about how we view talented\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThe inquiry was presented by me having to marry men and produced by best to take a sentence and if you want to listen to more episodes download our podcast such the b._b._c. thing climbing\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
