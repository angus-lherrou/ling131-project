manslaughter because of what they said on the phone or text it\nThose questions were at the heart of the controversial conviction of Michelle Carter she was found guilty last year and sentenced to Fifteen months in jail for text some phone calls encouraging or Eighteen year old boy friend Conrad Roy to commit suicide and he did\nThe case to the case is back before the Supreme judicial court where Michelle Carter is appealing her conviction\nWVU our senior correspondent Deborah Becker was at the Supreme judicial court this morning and she joins us now thanks for coming in ... thanks for having me I think so remind us of the details in this case what exactly was Michelle Carter convicted of last summer\nWell see this convicted as involuntary manslaughter and the judge found that she encouraged her boyfriend friend Conrad Roy who struggled with depression to get into his truck loved the truck was filling up with carbon monoxide\nThis happened in twenty four team Roy died in this track as you said and and Carter was not there she lives about fifty miles away at her home at the time that the prosecution presented tax during her trial where she encouraged already to kill himself and threatened that she that's going to make him get help if he did not\nAt the SAC hearing today Anthony it was that as the packed courtroom as you can imagine because this is a controversial decision about a dozen friends and family members have Royce were there for the hearing but they they didn't comments afterward\nRight and I understand that Carter herself was not in court today but her lawyers were right\nThe merely argued before the justices today a he said that this case raises a lot of questions including about the definition of involuntary manslaughter especially for juvenile defendants Carter was Seventeen\nAt the time that this happened you know says that it raises questions about freedom of speech and whether someone can be held responsible for their words and another person suicide especially in a state like Massachusetts that does not have a law against assisted suicide or against someone helping someone else take their own life\nHere's what attorney mark said after the hearing today\nI think that for literally just wrestling with a number of problems ... trial constitutional from stretched were\nThey get this is a very complicated issue which is why almost every other state in the country other than Massachusetts has a lot to deal with us from as a lot to deal with the suicide sent\nMe the attorneys argue of essentially that this is a very complicated case and they say essentially the lower court judge was wrong to rule that Michelle Carter created a situation where Carter Roy would Conrad Roy would try to kill themselves and then neglect her duty to try to save him\nDidn't start with that why not start with that I've got no right to call you these things but even with everything that happened you are my daughter our

of\nLike you I don't go you know I have a a horrendous aversion as well to people who do horrible things to women not to mention killing them and little kids the F so you know helped me out I mean talk about this sort of moral complexity that sort of surround factor\nYeah well you know he's he's a ... when when the novel begins we we started slowly learned that he's dying of prostate cancer

Massachusetts in a small yard or he volunteers are at the um the council on aging and drives you know elderly women usually two doctors appointments in the grocery store et cetera\nAnd he listens to books on tape mainly history [noise] um what I discovered in you know you and I have talked about the creative writing process before but for for me it's it's it's really all about\nFinding what's there and and it it's it's a weird kind of thing because this is a work of the imagination yet there is a feeling that when when it's going well that you're not making this stuff up that you really just kind of uncovering it and so when I began to find was\nA he had sort of casting he'd been out of prison for twenty five years and that he'd he'd sort of put himself in his own solitary that he uh he doesn't date women he he sticks to himself is a very solitary existence and what I kept feeling from him was was this complex combination of contrition\nUm but he still has a hot temper yeah he still has a short fuse and he knows this about himself and um I got\nThis reactor yeah yeah that's right I forgot [laughter] that's right out of\nWhite hot reactor that sometimes turns on and get some and in the case of killing his wife gets them into all kinds of trouble\nYeah as a kid he was a comic book reader in and um he began in in the letters you know that he begins to right Susan is a way to sort of describe the crazy kid he's views himself as having been he\nTalks about himself in the third person he describes himself that he could have been a a character in one of his own comic books and you could call him the reactor [noise]\nAnd um that that rang true to me so I kept going with it and I'm discovered more things about him but I Do I Do want to tell you though that I I share share your ambivalence I [noise]\nBut it's so hard you know I I think it's impossible to write character driven fiction um dishonest if if if you're judging your own characters I think you've got to allow anyone in any way that they are um\nEven if you don't like it you know police Pascal I Love this line anything written to please the author is worthless and\nSo it didn't please me but it didn't displeased me because I felt that I was uncovering something honest about the men even though I detest what he did but\nLike kept discovering was ... I could not to test it more than he did\nInteresting you know you seem you are haunted by [noise] certain lives I mean how wrongly certain lives can go I'm thinking of your last novel the garden of last days you featured a nine eleven attack or and yet you know sort of flush them out\nUh nine eleven attack or he wasn't a whole person so and gone so long you tell the story of Daniel why do you suppose you're drawn to these scary\nYou know I I don't know I I but you're absolutely right to put it that way I Do seem to be [noise]\nHaunted by how wrongly certain lives can go in and um I don't know I mean I you know a lot of us grow up around dysfunction and bad news and I certainly had my share as well I don't know if that has shaped how am as an adult I Do know that\nUm I Do know that and this is bumper sticker Christianity but I Do believe it's important to hate the sin and not the center [laughter] and and um even those of us who do the most heinous things\nAh they were somebody's baby and I'm not saying excuse them and I'm not saying you embrace them and I'm not saying you let them out of jail even\nUm but you know I Love this line from Tom Waits you know the great singer songwriter from one of his songs heart attack and vine\nThere is no devil there's just God when he's drunk [laughter] that's a great it's a great line as blasphemy to many people as there is I mean that line to get Tom Waits you know imprisoned or worse than ground just across the world right now but it's it's it's a line that I find myself a subscribing to [laughter] I\nDon't know why I'm reminded I was reminded of this I Love your memoir townie and I remember I think you're talking to you about\nYour dad at the end of county and you said something that stuck with me for years because I sort of read that in and and then when I got to the end of the novel I was sort of saying man\nInjuries to have you know she was like he was tough on the family and and I asked you you know how you sort of found capacity to be so loving to him at the end of his life and you said\nI truly believe that people do the best they know how to do and I sort of went back and extracted that quote right and it just made quite an impression on me and is that the way you also look at Daniel I think\nSo I think so because I now I remember in that conversation we had\n... which I I Do believe that all of us get out of bed across the planet or get off the ground wherever we sleep trying to have the best day we know how to have ... which is not necessarily the best day we can have yeah and that's where growth comes in right you know a\nYes reading from Daniel's point of view or certainly has led into that question you know one of my favorite lines from Flint Oreo con or one of her essay she says a writer's beliefs are not what she sees but the late by which she sees [laughter]\nSo I look back at you know all that I've written over the years um I've learned I've learned a lot about when I Believe in that one ... keeps coming up yeah\nI'm a good one I mean it's a good one to keep in mind I think like I think it leaves room for all of us to grow and we all screw up that hopefully we don't screw up is horribly is being around people like him\nRight but they screw up given their demons given their upbringing given their background they're sort of I mean not that you're again as you say you're not excusing someone who murders their wife but it's it's like worth getting into their shoes and trying to understand\nWhat and let me tell you why I think it's worth it because I I don't believe the I'll just speak for myself you know I've been writing all my life and and if I've learned nothing you know what I've been learning or I'd be what keeps coming to me lately\nIs a deeper I dig down into my own psyche and I write these these stories I don't think there is another I don't I don't believe in the other ... I think we are one with everybody and even those who do things that we did test\nEven those elected to an office who do things we did test him you know there's we're we're all we're all in this somehow and and I and I think it's it's it's good for our humanity individually to imagine walking in the shoes of any other kind of human being even those we did test\nI Want to come back and ask you to talk about something that you mentioned a moment ago when when when you are right this is about the writing process when you're writing when do you know that the creative force is with you I mean in other words I'm asking\nOn the one hand I imagine a writer pushing a vision of a story along deciding where it wants to go but there's a point when you suddenly feel sort of um that the story is guiding you you know that's what you just you're either my my guess is that must be an amazingly I'm an amazing relief\nIn it and it's and it's as deeply pleasurable a creatively and and for me it comes about when when two forces are in play and\nIn one is it has to be curiosity yeah you know you have to be authentically curious about the situation in the same way by the way you can't force yourself to fall in love with a particular person I'm up you've ever tried that I tried it once did and you either fall in love or you don't yeah uh the same way I don't think you can you can choose what you're curious about either so\nThat's number one you need to have that as creative fuel that seems to me and then the other thing is you've got to bring in at least three to ... for me three of the five senses and every\nOrient yourself into the truth of that human being like right now we're in a in a radio station we'd be having a totally different conversation if we were sitting outside on a deck with a sea breeze right even if we're talking about the same thing we would change just on that level\nSo I found over the years if I can get those two ingredients together um and then proceed with you know fear in face that something will come something always comes something always comes one of my favorite lines is from an ancient Chinese anonymous port we poets knock upon the silence for answering music\nA what I just heard is absolutely preposterous ... this is this is more of a cover up then invests\nThan an investigation market place yeah\nLet me ask you about last friday's extraordinary hearing with with Dr ... judge Kavanaugh did\nDemocrats in your view perhaps make a mistake I mean they spend a lot of that time demanding an FBI investigation\nAnd are people who might feel the other way could say well they got it people will debate whether or not the hearing was complete the investigation was complete enough but Republicans in particular wavering Republicans now have the cover that the FBI went back and took another look\nAnd I'm Wondering if you feel with hindsight the Democrats play this hand badly\n[noise] well the goal which we had was to get an FBI investigation\nIn reality what has happened is\nThat we've had a a a a shadow of the uh the uh pretend an investigation by the FBI under constraints that had been opposed by the Trump White house in terms of how far they can go so\nTo the extent to which they can put the name F. B. I. on this investigation\nThat's the totality of the credibility that that that you we can give to of this process because uh beyond that it's empty pages ... nothing behind it except to cover sheet saying FBI so its cynicism\nOr on stilts that's what the Republicans are engaging in\nA day are definitely trying to rush to judgment there in gate of engaging the systematic cover up the entire way we still haven't seen Ninety three percent of all of the documents that that Brett Kavanaugh how she handled inside of the White House Ninety three percent of all of his documents or and or\nIn the American people know\nThat what's at stake ultimately\nIs that Donald Trump said that he was going to appoint someone to the Supreme Court who would repeal wrote the weight would repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd protections for a pre existing conditions all that gets lost in this a charade which the Republicans have constructed a and called an FBI investigation\nCenter market we literally have ten seconds or Fifteen seconds left or so but it doesn't look like we somewhere I'm sitting in Boston that the Democrats are going to be able to stop this though is that a is that the way it looks to you at this point well\nThe the experts didn't have John McCain coming out to put his thumb down at one o'clock in the morning\nTo save the Affordable CARE Act so you haven't given we're going to continue to work everyday\nHeidi Heitkamp I'm from North Dakota just announced that she was going to vote no and\nMost experts to say in for the past two or three weeks that she would vote yes the cabinet so I don't think we know the answer yet far and that's why we're going to keep our energy level high and I and I hope that the American people do as well as our airport and for us to assume that we're going to lose so I think we can we still have a chance to win Massachusetts\nSenator Ed Markey thanks so much for joining us today we're very grateful no thank you much\nRegime [noise]\n\n\nFinally tonight we want to bring you another installment from WVU are in the Boston Globe's new investigative pod cast last seen it dives deep into the unsolved mysteries of the world's largest art heist at the Isabella Gardner Museum in Boston almost Thirty years ago\nLast night we brought you the first half of episodes three we heard from host Kelly horn and jak wrote illegal beginning there look at this idea was the high plane in Dorchester auto body shop in the belly of Boston's criminal underworld tonight we have the second half of episode three\nPicking up with retired FBI agent David Makovsky talking about a tip from FBI informant Anthony Romano\nOnly told me that a car Milam or Leno wanted to Rob blooms Fargo vote facility in the eastern\nSide of the Boston FBI county remind out with essentially accuser line informant his notes on the ... and goings in conversation he observed inside T I C helped ... work on his angle on them and they helped Cronin where kids on the Gardner [noise]\nObtained Anthony my mind as a confidential informant or parts of the ...\nBetween October Nineteen Ninety vendor Nineteen Ninety eight\nIn any other alongside ...\nFat which that's not the name is mother gave fat\nWhich he was born Richard Tchaikovsky picture a sharply dressed Bostonians missing all of his hair and some of his front teeth within inexplicable Brooklyn accent and a career as a scam artist as vast as the man himself as large which is not to say talk\nOne day fat which he called the Boston supervisor of the FBI squad that oversaw the gardener case that which he didn't introduce himself but he didn't have to\nYou actually said to the caller on the phone goes or you fat Ritchie 'cause we hadn't identified him so he goes there was a big budget goes well some people do call me that\n... says fat which he told him an agent Cronin that he could get the paintings from Carmelo Renee now and ah uses but [noise]\nYou know if I can get the five mil like getting the paintings from him\nThat's what I Want to lose your goes out there not here so we just looked at each other just as beautiful\nAnd that's how Richie ... achy a fat Ritchie became the second\nConfidential informant inside T.

B. U. R. Boston NPR News station\n[noise]\nNinety nine WB you are with special coverage from radio Boston Good afternoon I'm Anthony Brooks and we're following breaking news as the U.S Senate gets set to vote on the Supreme Court\nNomination of Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow this morning following the FBI's weeklong investigation into allegations of sex\nMajor hurdle in the Senate procedural vote of fifty one forty nine that moves the nomination to a final vote tomorrow and here's where we stand right now Arizona Senator Jeff flake says he will vote yes to confirm Kavanaugh he was one of the key\nRepublican swing votes in this nomination battle Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski the one of the other\nKey Republican swing vote says she will vote no so this could come down to Republican Susan Collins of Maine who's expected to announce her decision from the Senate floor any minute now and we will bring you that live a when that happens\nUntil then I'm joined by our friday week in review panelists tc oughta gearing professor and co director\nOf the center for social innovation at Boston College she's also a member of WB ... executive advisory board and a regular member of our weaken review panel to sound a Happy Friday thanks for coming in thanks for having me also\nWith us is Tom nickels he's a professor of national security affairs at the U.S Naval War college in Newport Rhode Island\nAnd the Harvard extension call a school he's here in his personal capacity not representing the U.S Naval War college Tom thanks so much for coming in nice to be back thanks so uh what a week and as we wait for Susan Collins to begin her comments on the Senate floor to ceiling I'll start with you\nThere is a huge amount of pressure on this Republican senators shoulders right now what are you thinking about\nYou know I'm having had some Public Leadership roles in my career previously\nWhen you ask to be put in these leadership positions you have said I Want the burden of responsibility of representing the American people and sometimes that\nBurden sit very very heavily on your shoulders and I and I my heart goes out to her for the difficulty of this decision and I also think this is a moment when we need so many people to remember that they asked to be the leaders in this position making these decisions that\nLittle bit of information about us Susan Collins of Maine she was among the senators who voted yes to move this toward a procedural vote which uh Tom might lead one to indicate to to suspect that she will\nVote yes tomorrow but it doesn't necessarily mean that so we're waiting to hear from her but what are you thinking about what what is Susan Collins a you know juggling in her mind ... before she makes us very difficult decision\nWell it's a I think the procedural vote as an important point to make I used to work in the U.S Senate I'm a long time ago and culture is a vote that says we can debate and go to a vote or an have and and uh actually talk about the vote itself so\nPeople who vote yes on on um as a constant can say look I let the process play out I didn't vote to Stein me a final vote\nAnd so that's a pretty common thing now it's pretty unusual for somebody to flip\nIn between the cloture vote and a final confirmation vote now she does that\nThat'll be interesting and really the thing about from college you couldn't scripted this I mean this kind of nominee with this sort of scandal in this kind of uproar with a female senator from a small divided kind of purplish what really kind of read versus blue New England state I mean if you submitted this was a TV script\nA they tell you to rework it 'cause it's a little to\nPat [laughter] yeah Everytime I picture here I see Iraq on one side and a hard place on the editor right in her started standing in between them\nWell a all morning a we have ah been listening to some of the testimony by members of the Senate I Want to play a clip from Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal who was speaking on the Senate for just a moment ago he's among the Democrats all the Democrats obviously voting are not actually we're waiting to hear from Joe Manchin as well but\nMost Democrats or will be voting no\nAnd a senator Blumenthal focused on the demeanor of judge Kavanaugh during that a difficulty hearing a week ago today where he came across as very sharp very angry very partisan so here's a little bit of what Richard Blumenthal said just a few moments ago\nCannot be denied is that\nPicture of judge panel\nCommittee which indicated profound a lack of temperament and prospering\nTom Nichols um what's your view on this how badly did judge Kavanaugh undermined his credibility among a number of people would that performance a week and\nUm I think it was disastrous and uh you know speaking personally I I'm a kind of moderate New England conservative of the old school when Kavanaugh was named first pipe popped up I said well\nThat's about what you'd expect I mean this could have been a ... a bushel Rubio point here are Scott Walker appointee um to me that outburst in front of the Senate was disqualifying in and of itself it he he went down the rat hole of conspiracies he pointed at the Democrat in a way to ... even Clarence Thomas Suzanne and I were talking about this earlier\nHe went angry but he didn't single out of the party I'm so that was the distinction\nYou're not just that he was angry but that he was red hot part of\nIt but he was part is in that he was a I think doing damage to the institutions of government by going for these conspiracy theories and I think you know some of my former cameras on the writer saying well you can't disqualify the guy because he lost his temper over being smeared in one herring and my answer is\nIs why we have hearings it's not a longevity promotion hearings don't matter and how the nominee conducts him or herself in hearing doesn't matter than just do away with hearings and just promote people based on a link up service we don't do it that way we have hearings for a reason and I think Kevin are completely flamed out in his ...\nWhat did you see last week to charter without a performance by Kevin\nI appreciate what times that and I'll add to it becomes qualifying was actually the term that came up for me as well and I'll go back to my original point we're talking about him saying I'd better than anyone else I deserve to hold the role that one of only nine people on the planet we'll hope to be a steward of other people's needs\nAnd who's John I'm going to interrupt because our understanding as we are going to senators and our ... our man until just live on the center for sergeant arms were store order and the gallery [noise]\nSo Susan Collins is on the Senate floor right now and she's about to announce her decision on the Kavanaugh nomination uh disarmament arms we understand is trying to restore order and you're hearing from protesters in the background there we're going to go ... lived at the center here we go expressions\nOf approval or disapproval are not permitted in southern galleries sooner forming\nMr President Mr President the five previous times that I've come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination adjusted to the United States Supreme court\nI have the gun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of\nThe occasion but today we have come to the conclusion\nOf the confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of a guide her level political campaigns than a solemn occasion\nThe president nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July none\nWithin moments of that announcement special interest groups raised to be the first to oppose and including one organization that didn't even bother to fail and the judges name\nOn its ... press release they simply road\nThat they opposed Donald Trump's nomination out acts\nTo the Supreme Court of the United states a number of senators joined the race to announce their opposition but they were being to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition before\nThing nominees identity was even know\nSince that time we had seen special interest groups with their follow words into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentation and outright falsehoods about judge Kavanaugh's judicial record\nOver the top rhetoric and distortions up his record and testimony at its first hearing produced short lived headlines which all those ... hours later and continue to live on and be spread\nOther sides met with have expressed concern said Justice Kennedy's retirement\nThreatens the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh described the overcook pals decision which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark\nHe also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece cage cakes shop opinion\nFor the court's majority stating that\nQuote the days of treating
