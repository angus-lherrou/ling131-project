majestic theater arts Emerson dot org\nAnd Avi FX advanced audio video in lighting services for meetings that matter events that inspired and exhibits that engage these effects dot com our passion shows [noise]\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker or their secret courts are operating in Massachusetts the Boston Globe says there are in the form of closed door hearings before a single court official where thousands of criminal charges can and do disappear\nThe paper analyzed data from what are known as show cause hearings which are held before court clerks and the paper says its analysis shows\nAn arbitrary part of our state's criminal justice system globe spotlight reporter Nicole Duncan joins us to talk about this Nicole welcome to radio Boston Hi thanks for having me on the line is Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney in Boston Thanks for being here Joe\nHi thanks for having me during our conversation also we're going to hear from a member of the governor's council parents Kennedy and we'll talk with him as well but first call I Want to start with you why are you calling me secret courts\nSo in Massachusetts and around the country generally criminal proceedings for adults are always public suffered in the minute a person is arranged arraigned on a charge in the courtroom you or I can go into the courtroom and we can look up the case\nBut in Massachusetts if you're accused of a crime and having been arrested you generally have a right to this hearing that data that's completely hidden from the public\nUm I Can't go into the hearing and it's a very different from every aspect of the open court that you know we see in court houses across the country but this on three arrest yeah Priya Reagan Korea rest sorry not pre arrest it's usually for people who haven't been arrested so it's pre arraignment\nOkay [noise] uh so so give us an example of of what you found here in terms of the criminal charges that are heard in these show cause hearings\nI understand your dies level of training for all clerk magistrates\nWell that's what it is it's it's a standardized level training the old ah various um training throughout the year for\nA they're either not educational environment yeah yeah and and the coolest thing it better than I Am fewer educational review educational requirements for clerk magistrate is deciding matters of law ... aside from that though I'm just wondering what\nAbout ... ... if you're talking about lawyer versus non lawyer I'll be glad to address that um I think that I've been like Joe I've been a criminal defense lawyer for many years have been a criminal defense lawyer for thirty five years um and I have dealt with\nMany many court magistrates that were attorneys and many that will not Mm and some of the best work magistrates though I've dealt with ...\nWhat do we do to make sure that the system is more uniform I guess is the is the thrust of this question here\nWhat respect I mean I used it in with respect to with Corning hearings\nUm that's something that could be discussed and certainly wouldn't be a a a bad idea I've attended many cord magistrates hearings where they are recorded I don't I don't see that as a security issue and by the way the statute allows for any party to either bringing a recording device or a ...\nA which I'm done I brought in St demographers into court match the hearings before when they were somewhat serious\n... not as a as a result of this report do you think the governor's council would consider making any changes or anything\nWell the governor's council doesn't have any jurisdiction over making changes with the way to him a system works within the court we approve a the court magistrates themselves when the governor nominates one we have to make sure that they're qualified in it when you look at who's going to be a court magistrate it's not just\nA legal background because I think that can be made off with a great deal of experience to for example there's just a quick note to straighten Wharton court system for many years they might be qualified but\nA big part of their job goes beyond that they have to be good managers managing the quirks offers some of whom have a you know fifty sixty Seventy employees from a smaller but uh it [noise] you have to be one manager as well and I think that's an important part of the jaw\nNicole wondering what's what's the reaction been to the story\nI think we've heard from a lot of people who were surprised that this even existed um I mean I actually [noise] hold all fifty states see if there was anything even remotely similar\nUm and many of the prosecutors and the court officials that I talked to said no I never heard of anything like that it's really surprising um on our and we've heard from other people who've gone through some of these hearings and we're glad that we were shedding light on it and\n[noise] and so in terms of any action that might be taken or any changes still too early to tell\nYeah I mean that is something that I think legislators can look into\nI mean this is in fact something that the trial court itself could actually um mix them action or make some changes on 'em because this isn't actually codified directly into law the idea of these um these hearings being secret\nUm came from an ass Jaycee a Supreme um Supreme Court decision a so it's not actually something that is codified into law\nWe did we should say we did get a statement from a trial court chief justice ... saying that the role of these hearings on clerk magistrates is consistent\nWith criminal justice reform efforts recently in Massachusetts load doesn't look like there would be a changes anytime soon I'm Sorry that we are out of time because I Know we could continue this conversation but I Want to say\nThank you to Nicole dumped on the Boston Globe spotlight reporter Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney\nAnd Terry Kennedy attorney and member
