backdrop to this protest is the appearance of Arizona Republican Senator Jeff flake who broke ranks with fellow Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee on friday and called for an FBI investigation of cabinet\nBoston mayor Marty Walsh joined the protestors today\nShould never met voted out advance off before the Senate this clearly a lot of betting on WB\nOur senior political reporter Anthony Brooks joins us from Boston city hall plaza now Anthony hello welcome back to the self\nPay good to be here don't\nSell Jeff Flake Republican senator just spoke about an hour ago I'm told that this Forbes under thirty summit what did he say\nWill his main message was that he pushed for this extra FBI investigation because he'd been trouble for some time that they weren't getting the answers that they needed about allegations of sexual misconduct by I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nBack when he was in high school flake said he wants to make sure that the FBI investigations up to standard as he put it\nAnd he talked about his decision making at the end of that extraordinary hearing a last friday here's a bit here's a bit of what he's\nHad been trouble for a while but I I felt that we weren't doing due diligence with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nIf there are questions that haven't been answered and the the FBI could've investigated I felt that it needed to know since the Judiciary Committee only has one person majority for Republicans eleven to him I'm and I'm not the eleventh republic\nThey're so does he use that leverage to ah convinced um some of his fellow Republicans and the White House and you have some Democrats going along with him that\nHe would advance I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination the full Senate if the FBI or took up this limited uh investigation what you're doing now he was also asked if he found Dr bloody for credible she's a professor who who brought the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nIf he found her credible then why uh advance her nomination to the floor and flake said basically that he also found a Kavanaugh's denials believable so that's why he wanted\nA move the FBI to do more and he was also asked if he was uncomfortable with Kavanaugh's anger and is in a sense of partisanship\nAnd he said he was uncomfortable with that but he also said if I had been accused of something that I didn't do I'd be angry too so that was a what he said pretty much in summer\nMore for those were books auto [laughter]\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker or their secret courts are operating in Massachusetts the Boston Globe says there are in the form of closed door hearings before a single court official where thousands of criminal charges can and do disappear\nThe paper analyzed data from what are known as show cause hearings which are held before court clerk than the paper says its analysis shows an arbitrary part of our state's criminal justice system\nGlobe spotlight reporter Nicole Duncan joins us to talk about this Nicole welcome to radio Boston Hi thanks for having me also on the line is Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney in Boston Thanks for being here Joe\nHi thanks for having me during our conversation also we're going to hear from a member of the governor's council parents Kennedy and we'll talk with him as well but first Nicole I Want to start with you why are you calling me secret courts\nSo in Massachusetts and around the country generally criminal proceedings for adults are always public suffer the minute a person is arranged arraigned on a charge in the courtroom you or I can go into the courtroom and we can look up the case\nBut in Massachusetts if you're accused of a crime and having been arrested you generally have a right to this hearing that data that's completely hidden from the public\nUm I Can't go into the hearing and it's a very different from every aspect of the open court that you know we see in court houses across the country but this on three arrest pre arraignment three arrest sorry not pre arrest it's usually for people who haven't been arrested such pre arraignment\nOkay uh so so give us an example of of what you found here in terms of the criminal charges that are heard in these show cause hearings\nSuch a huge range I mean in general misdemeanors are the ones that are going to go to this but in our story we actually found that\nNo one out of twelve of them were felonies so there are some serious charges that were going into these uh to these hearings for example I'm the beginning of our story it's an average aggravated assault claim and domestic violence\nCase there is a motor vehicle homicide case and so these are the kinds of cases I end up\nUm being\nWithin ... closed hearings without any accountability\nSo how would it be that these cases when you're talking about charges like motor vehicle homicide\nThat there wouldn't have been an arraignment already that they already wouldn't have been slated to go through traditional court as opposed to a show cause hearing lick will who makes that determination that these cases might be fit to go to a show cause hearing as opposed to a traditional judge [noise]\nAnd so in some cases the police department might set it up for hearing instead on instead of going straight to arraignment because they find that the person isn't a flight risk or a danger to other people for example I'm so that it so they're saying oh there might be\nUm some questions about it so they might send it to these kind of hearings and in general if you are accused of misdemeanor\nAnd you haven't been arrested you know some people will know that you have a right to this hearing so a lot of defense attorneys um they might see that their client is going to go straight to arraignment that they can say oh hold on one second we're actually going to have to stop for hearing\nWell let's ask our our defense attorney who we have on the line Joe Simon's so does that typically happen if you see that you have a client in the system here do you try to divert a case to a clerk magistrate\nAbsolutely or if it's a misdemeanor though was committed outside of the police officers presents then you have a right with from a short exceptions for example domestic violence but uh yeah sometimes that happens we're\nMaking arrest even bring somebody to court and then you realize that the person who actually has a structure tore right not to be arraigned for cork marriage streets hearing a lot of cases of\nJudges agreed to dismiss\nThat some of them never come back some of them do come back and get screened out and then some of them come back and and the court issues a complex\nStill cause hearings are problematic Joe\nI don't think so I think they serve a a good purpose so for one thing in Massachusetts [noise]\nAnybody can go into a courthouse and do a clerk's office and apply for criminal complaint against anybody else there's really no bar um in almost no oversight to that except that they have these ... registries hearings\nTo the court magistrates are of a function where they screen out cases that really have no business being in criminal court or many times there isn't probable cause the crime was committed and somebody simply seeking redress that you should be better served in civil court\nUm sometimes to police despite doing their best efforts in responding to calls you have to make split second decisions and don't always have the ability to analyze whether in order to really\nShould be a go into court whether there's enough probable cause\nRight but I think I Am you know I think the article and and you know the coal certainly correct me if I'm wrong but it brings up that there's an arbitrary system here what if you don't know about such a thing as show cause hearing what if what if you have not hired a private attorney who knows about such things and\nYou may not have the same opportunity to have your case or by clerk magistrate and you are going to go before a traditional judge where they're likely will be something uh in public or at least or possibly a criminal record\nAnd that's very different from what happens in these hearings does this result in a different system for people depending on who's in the know or who can afford a lawyer to fight it\nUnfortunately yes those definitely true and I can't tell you how many people don't call me until after they've tried to go to the court's hearings by themselves\nPeople call me and say oh I've got invitation to court I don't know if I Need to go or not I don't think a lot of people realize what they really are even people who were summonsed to go to these hearings because the the way some of them are awarded or well you can appear and if you want to have an attorney you can bring one\nUm [noise] I think people would be a\nShould be better advised of the the consequences\nAre the chances that they have [noise]\nYou know to protect the rights when you say invited to court I don't think anybody gets invited and willingly right still would have been invited to [laughter]\nConversation with the clerk at me off and then you see things on the record too I mean for them to their detriment everything's under oath so they might see something that you know for it and we could be um you know deemed some sort of a mission or cause I had mission against for their their life right\nBut but you're saying that these are on the record but Nicole what you found is there's no recording of these proceedings or the these are not public\nDefinitely not a requirement to be recorded um there within the guidelines of the district courts they say it's recommended but we call it a lot of courts and really it's kind of a toss up whether you get into a district court where it's actually recorded\nUm there certainly aren't public transcripts for anyone um I mean some people compared this to a grand jury proceedings but those are really different um there are those are\nThose are with the jury is of citizens who are making these decisions um and their transcripts or some time but they're usually recorded those times um and so it's a really different case and I think you\nReally hit the nail on the head and you're saying that there were these big disparities I mean we were looking at places\nThat just had completely different standards of justice you know you go to a court like Chelsea and only Eighteen percent of those cases\nHave charges issue but then you go to stir and eighty percent of those charges ... would would issue and when you look at racial disparities in some individual courts I mean you see some really troubling things we have a ... a statistic from Brookline courts\nSo about eighty percent of the white defendants who went to show cause hearing could leave without a charge but only forty five percent of minorities do\nAnd so you know I can see why people may say this this is a wave screening but without any kind of open hearing you know you don't have people who are able to study um why these disparities exist and how to change them they\nBut but is this a system though that as Joe says is a way to sort of weed out frivolous cases and perhaps it improve the efficiency to a certain degree of the criminal justice system\nI think there'll there'll be people who argue about that I don't think that\nThere's necessarily within our story we're saying this entire system should be abolished there is a really big difference between not having these hearings at all and having these hearings but having them open so that\nThere can be people coming into these hearings to give some oversight I think a lot of people would agree that oversight is good for everyone defendants uh people that people who are involved in this even for you know the magistrates like we can\n... um and we can have records about things that might have gone wrong before cases and well\nLet's bring in parents Kennedy who's a member of the governor's council and on this because the governor's council approved the appointment of of click magistrate so welcome to radio Boston is er Kennedy\nThank you Devon thank you for having me on\nThe what about him oh hugely\nOutside they had searching directors before him and he's the first guy to come outside of the company he joined the company in April as a member of the new board of directors they cut back from each team members to twelve\nAnd a ... and he's got a sterling career as a running them a model conglomerate very tightly focused company ... increased shareholder value many times over market value many times over\nBut you know he faces a huge task is an outside or Deb I spoke with Bill all that he's the managing director of the Martin dressed hundreds MIT entrepreneurship and\nHe's a professor of practice at MIT Sloan school business\nHow do you keep about ...\nAnd ... which is for internal person because it's hard to put your homework but if you get an extra little person they can look at it differently and change it but they're not part of the DNA so it's really hard for them to keep the good people there because if you don't have the people ... you're just not going to be able to get this thought\nYou know it's all about people as far as a lead is concerned in most people actually because they've got three hundred thousand employees scattered over a hundred and thirty countries around the globe this is a big ship to turn\n... so what is this all mean for the company or would you say how how would you explain it\n[noise] well it means you've got to be a different company this is a company that invented the industrial age and that has to reinvent itself and cannot do that well you know you can't cut your way to success it's just can't be done\nI mean if they have a massive right I'm right down that they announced today of twenty three billion dollars in its power unit\nIt's got a over thirty billion dollars in unfunded pension liabilities this is a company really at the edge so really struggling what'd you say\nYeah I mean it's worth a hundred billion dollars let's put that in perspective for a third of the world's energy is generated by\nA GED and forty percent of the world's energy software that manages that is ... is a big company but\nYou know its stock was removed from the down it was the dog and the down the listed first time in a hundred and twenty five years\nAnd so remind us that in terms of this moved to Boston two years ago uh [noise] what did you get for the city and state and how about the promises to this area\nOf the hundred and fifty bucks and promises a hundred and twenty five from the state saying I'm One of the hundred and fifty bucks a hundred and fifty million did I say that's ... ... [laughter] hundred and twenty five\nMillion dollars and twenty five million dollars from the state you know in tax incentives and all kinds of things and twenty five million from the city is contingent upon bringing jobs to city and eight hundred jobs they promised by twenty twenty five\nI'm GE he promised to chicken fifty million dollars to local institutions has been making payments and it's been funding a lot of different things organizations health care and into schools in Boston [noise] um but it's a\nIt's new corporate headquarters oh good question well so that was on hold they they decided they would never built two ... two buildings are warehouses they doing that there was a building of the new can of building toward a million dollars is on hold\nGoes to the twenty Twenty one day I think it can be completed on WB or Boston on a supporter of risk element thanks for being you bet that\n\nThe Isabella Stewart Gardner museum is known as one of Boston finest institutions but it's also the side of the world's largest art heist\nOn march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety to the stress is Boston police officers locked into the museum in the early morning hours after St Patrick's Day they walked out with their teen pieces of art somebody Rembrandt for me here and thank God\nAnd display of five million dollar reward from the museum not one piece has been returned\nTwenty eight years later it's still a mystery and now the subject of a podcast last scene is the production of WB you are in the Boston Globe and tonight on radio Boston We're bringing you the first half of episode to which you can find on apple pod cast or wherever you download the podcast\nAt the end of last week we brought you episode one in two parts and we heard about how the thieves got in and what exactly they still an episode to host Kelly or an ad jak wrote a leak Alex Florida this idea what is the Gardner heist was an inside job\n[noise] the gates abuser della

millisecond in time hung over you for all of your days to come imagine being known above all else\nCan never undo [noise] and now imagine that the going estimate for the cost of your mistake is upwards of five hundred million dollars recap\nWho was manning to watch desk in the Gardner Museum at one twenty four in the morning on march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety doesn't have to imagine any if that he's lived\nHere for a minute closely I hadn't heard that [noise] no I've told the story though you are about ... years time I'm not just advertising it normally hear sound like when I go to get a job [noise] I'm like oh I open the door on the\nTwenty five years ago and they got ... five hundred million dollars to hire me right\nAbbott has always maintained his innocence and he says he's always been forthcoming about his decision to open the door the night the robbery even in his earliest exchanges with the first to Boston FBI agent on the case\nAnd I said well what do you want to know I Will tell you and he said I immediately felt like I suppose is why didn't have anything to lose\n...\nHas never been arrested for anything related to the Gardner heist but he's also never escaped the suspicion of investigators who said that the men who robbed the museum had help from the inside\nThat they knew their way around it and knew the police weren't coming there implication is that al ... is the reason why\nThose investigators have never publicly named Abbott as a suspect they won't even name him as one of the security guards on duty that night but Rick Abbott must be a suspect why else would you have to keep answering investigators' questions and testified before a grand jury\nWhat forgot that didn't make a mistake when he let that feeds into gardening medium\nWhat buzzing them in with all part of a larger plan to Rob it\nWhat if ... was the inside guy on the largest art heist in history\n[noise]\nWhenever something is stolen from a museum the most likely culprit is an employee according to data reviewed by the FBI about eighty percent of museum robberies are inside jobs so given that stat and the fact that this security guards opened the door and let the thieves walk right into the gardener\nIt makes sense then investigators would look hard at Rick abba our colleague from the Boston Globe Steve Kirk ... has been looking hard it ever too he's been reporting on the highest for more than Twenty years for the globe\nHe's written a book about it master thieves it took Steve a while to find out that\nI was about the whole day up and brought a bow Vermont are trying to find work I couldn't find them couldn't find them but it had been told you may be staying at a shack up in the hills I went there\nAnd there are nine o'clock at night I find there is a topic project and there's a car or new driveway show I Walk up and knock on the door and a show master who was ... from the Boston Globe trying to reach ... will to guard the museum at\nThe door flies open and outcomes Rick\nIn two thousand Thirteen Steve and Rick habits sat down and an Indian restaurant over chickens in Duluth and beer\nFor some reason I seem to be the only person involved today\nFor only one who's not trying to figure it out and that mainly comes down to I'm Glad to be alive [noise]\nThe river feeling of shame as to what happened to this did you feel personally responsible for\nI mean I feel bad about\n\n[laughter] so who was ... on march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety\nYou had a long flowing curly here you know didn't dress when he came to the museum and as a as a night watchman regard [noise] uh I think the night of the ... he was wearing short of type ... you know in a cowboy hat\nAbbott's get up the night of the robbery does bear mentioned if only because Abbott himself knew how an security guard like he appeared to the cops who are really robbers\n'cause I knew of look at them long hair and write the guests steps in my head my Berklee

Kelvin us behavior in high school just heard about what the new trade deal to replace NAFTA is going to mean for American workers and the companies that they work for that's what we like to do we like to bring issues local issues national issues home\nAnd find out what they're going to mean to all of us\nSo that's what we try to do on a daily basis with radio Boston with all things considered MORNING EDITION all here and now all the programs that you listen to make the call now to support that kind of independent journalism one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to age seven or W. B. U. R. dot org thanks a lot\nA\nWelcome back to the radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker with deep divisions over the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh we spent some time today talking about how young people are processing this controversy and this cultural moment\nA Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday said forty eight percent of American voters most believe Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford forty one percent most believe Brett Kavanaugh and today President Trump said this\nA very scary time for young men in America would you be ... you may not be guilty\nDivide effect teenagers particularly when it comes to talking with them about sexual assault and consent\nJoining us in Studio is mega rebel she's founder and director of partners in sex education an organization that delivers comprehensive sex education to schools cross Massachusetts Hi thanks for coming in hello thanks so much for having me and listeners we want to hear from you have you talked with your children about these hearings\nAnd what do you tell them what do you tell teenagers about their Brett Kavanaugh\nHearings and the Senate Judiciary committee hearings and they're related controversy that's been going on since the hearing ended what does education around sex and consent looked like in your school\nYou can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also send us a tweet at radio lost him so ... what have you been hearing a from educators and young people amid all of this debate about the Brett Kavanaugh hearings\nSo our organization partners in sex education has always taught about consensus I that's an integral part of teaching about healthy relationships in communication and sort of getting the basis of how young people should learn to\nRelate to each other and certainly a consent questions have been coming up in classes um our educators are not trying to get into political um debate to the students but I have been hearing a even as recently as today from an educator that\nAh that they were talking about it um and a lot of the conversation tend to be polarized by gender which is unfortunate because I feel like we should be getting the same message is\nSo so give me an example of of what was happening in terms of their polarization\nAnd well I just that I think that young men are are not\nAre not always understanding I think the young men are often told and for instance by the president and I quote their tolls and they're the ones that are somehow victimized by us\nUm and I think even polarized it along gender lines as a mistake I think that we all need to think about how to do better in terms of how to communicate and how to respect other people's person HUD and how to\nUm respect uh have have sexual morality and carrying relationship and not just make it down to the the letter of the law in terms of consent\nSo is there something specific that you say is there sort of a\nGeneral rule of thumb that you tell young people about about understanding what consent looks like well that that's a great question because the\nWay young people often want to approach it is like I said off into the letter of the law and so there are things about the law that they need to know they need to know that the legal age of consent in Massachusetts sixteen they need to know that if ah somebody is under the influence of drugs or alcohol they cannot legally consent\nUm and so these are you know there's many other aspects so these are important\nBut I think that ah when you're talking about sometimes you're just talking about just what is criminally prosecute rubble and what is not and that should not be the standard that we hold and that should not be what we're teaching we should be teaching people how to be\nRespectful and so consent education needs to be broader than that and it needs to be not just about sex consent education is about everything and it can be taught from a very\nVery young age ... and how how do you do that at a young age well for\nInstance um when anyone we we talk about this with in elementary schools all the time in terms of somebody's physical space and somebody's boundaries and to somebody else want\n'em to be touched or not is that okay keeping your hands to yourself um whether ah children are um\nYou know allowed to say yes and notes of things that happened to them and I think ... at a very very young age that should happen in the home right so a a child says no to to to being tackled and what do we do often adults because it's fun to make children laugh will continue to tickle a child\nOr what have we taught them about their capacity to say no to that which happens to their bodies and so I think that if we respect that no and then we're teaching them that if that they're now will be respected and we're teaching them from the youngest age that they can also have that same kind of respect for other people now [noise]\nWhen I talk a little bit of out of the women as well as we mentioned boys a little bit but ah and and just in case somebody hasn't heard uh some of the testimony we're in a place of of the uh emotional a piece of what Christine Blasey Ford said last week during the Senate Judiciary committee here's a bit of that\nI Believe he was going to rape me I Try to yell for help when I did read put his hand over my nails stopped me from yelling [noise]\nThis is terrified me the most and it had the most lasting impact on my life it was hard for me to breathe and I thought that was accidentally going to kill me [noise]\nSo ah the mega rebel and when that\nIs televised and replayed over and over again how should parents and teachers\nDeal with that [noise] wow yeah that that is really emotional and [noise]\nI think that the problem there at first I Want to say that the problem there in that situation is not as as we often assume a miscommunication misunderstanding about whether or not she gave consent clearly\nShe did not right that is a basic um of ignoring of her\nPerson HUD and ... and her that\nWas like you know to make a point to other men was a man I'm kind of showing off in a way for another man and so that that is a whole different situation but those are also [noise]\nThe kinds of things that with a a social emotional learning curriculum that we can address in the classroom so what should um [noise] what should parents tell their young people\nI guess I'm telling ya livid and tell young women um and I guess the idea that you should be respected that you\nHave a right to say it's a yes or no with what happens to your body and in that I feel like if\nYoung women believe that they should be respected than they should be heard\nThan they would be more able to communicate but also more able to report when something goes wrong because they're actually very very low numbers of of young women and young men\nBecause let's not forget the young men are also assaulted are they really um\nUnfortunately high rate so they'd be less young women and young men who feel that it is their fault and who feel that they will not be believed and unfortunately these messages that are happening on the national stage are reinforcing the idea that it is their fault and it they should not be believed and we need to fight very hard to prevent\nThat ... uh take some of the callers now James is calling from Manchester by the sea James you're on the air\nOn how you doing okay how are you I'm not a good question I Know that you know I Believe\nThat everybody should be heard that there's value is you have to do that to the root causes them to use my son's high school or in high school\nGirls make 'em up and start talking to him and started showing interested in him he's car shark\nWays and drawing them nervous about what they might say the advances\nOr encourage you on that board Nicky I'm just wondering how do you talk to your children
