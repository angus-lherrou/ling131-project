of Flint, Michigan and communities around the world more mutt dot org [noise]\n\nThis is radio Boston I'm Anthony Brooks and we'll begin today with a potential cost of a ballot question that has Massachusetts voters closely divided question one would set limits on the numbers of patients assigned to nurses at hospitals\nAnd other health care facilities across the state advocates including some nurses community groups in a long list of elected officials\nSay the measure would improve patient care now comes a study from the independent Massachusetts health policy commission\nIt concludes that if question one were to pass hospitals would have to hire as many as three thousand additional nurses and the cost it could run as high as nine hundred fifty million dollars a year\nThat's almost a billion dollars if you're keeping score at home do your view are common health editor carry Goldberg has been looking at the study and was at the health policy commission today and she's with us now I care hey Anthony so let's dig into that nine hundred and fifty million dollar figure a bit more how did the commission come up with that number\nSo first of all the Nineteen fifty million at the high end of a range they're saying it could cost between six hundred and Seventy six and Ninety nine hundred and forty nine million\nThat's a big contrast to what the proponents of the ballot measure estimating\nWhich was more like between thirty five and forty seven million dollars right now that's a big contract yes and and it's quite hefty sum when you put it in the context of Massachusetts having some of the most expensive health care on earth already\nWhich by the way is why we had this health policy commission as a watchdog on health costs in the first place\nNow David our back he's the director for research and cost transit the commission\nEstimates that costs could amount to just over one percent\nAll right now one percent of them found like a lot\nIt doesn't but it's one or maybe a little closer to two percent of a lot of sixty one billion dollars or as our backs at an understated Lee I Would say that a substantial amount and it's up to three point five percent of total hospitals spending\nAll right so what does that consist of all that's been\nWritten so it's several elements so as you said hospitals would have to hire a couple of three thousand more registered nurses the pay for nurses would likely go up because that's basic economics right there would be more demand for them and if a similar law in California is any indication\nNurses income might go up by an average of maybe like four percent or so and it would cost money to have this news staffing ratio system in place in hospitals\nAnd then there would be some one time costs like it could cost millions to put in like a tool to help assess how sick patients are and therefore what the nurse ratio should be forgiven unit\nRight right it interesting that flake is bringing that up the use of course one of the the the key swing votes last friday he was the one who sort of shocked the world when he pushed for a delay to allow the FBI investigation\nSo what do we know about ah the FBI investigation so far first of all when do we know when it's expected to conclude one we might see something about it from it will we see something from it\nI've heard some charter among senators today that it could wrap up as early as today and\nUh the the report was first go to the White House and pretty soon it would be here on Capitol Hill with the according to\nSenate majority leader McConnell available for every senator to look at try to lead it won't be released to the public however we don't know exactly when that's going to end the FBI has not been a you know speaking publicly about this investigation as it usually doesn't but\nEveryone is is kind of anxious to see when it comes out and people are on guard for it to potentially land today if not later\nRight and so he'll water lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez who who is also made allegations against judge Kavanaugh what are they saying about the FBI investigation so far\nThey are arguing that the FBI is not conducting a thorough investigation that it's not following up on her requests from them\nOr for follow up and ... interviews to speak with the FBI is that it hasn't you know pursued other leaders that they consider relevant to the investigation or tried to contact other witnesses that they believe you know could corroborate um or at least shed some light on\nThe uh the allegations here so they have said publicly that um they they worry the FBI hands or being tied and that it's not conducting a thorough investigation and those concerns of the ... and may have had announced critics here on Capitol Hill\nRight meanwhile a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking about a ... a vote as early as this week or how soon could that come in and do we know if it'll be a straight a floor vote or good Republican leadership take some kind of different rooms here [noise]\nWell it would have to eventually be a floor vote on the confirmation but what McConnell has said is the full Senate will vote on the nomination this week now if if we want to parse that that means\nIt could go up until Saturday it's not clear whether McConnell is talking about a final a Senate confirmation vote or if he's talking about the beginning the process but you're involved with a procedural vote followed by thirty hours of debate this week so a lot of questions now\nI Will say McConnell has been very confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed that he has maintained that confidence he does not have fifty votes yet\nAssuming flake is still a yes he said he's going to support the the nomination but he was an FBI investigation first assuming he's still a yes McConnell can only counter forty nine votes right now because Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski has not yet decided it's very likely to come down to those two if\nA one if both of them vote no then the nomination that's probably dead at one of them vote snow on the nomination could still survive if the other books yet so I'm a you know to anyone washing the site and wants to know how it's going to come down and keep your eyes on those two\nInteresting so I I Want to come back to President Trump sort of clearly doubling down on on the strategy of whipping up his base I guess at that rally in Mississippi um where he criticized Waze forty also said\nUm that it's a scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of\nUm what what effect do you think all of this might have on the coming election what's what's your view on that so he'll [noise]\nThe president is trying to counter the argument that uh you know his his critics and critics of Brett Kavanaugh are making which is\nThat if you know there there is a serious a possibility that Brett Kavanaugh may be\nAssault or and he does not deserve to be on the Supreme Court not what Trump is pointing out is that someone who you know someone like having a deserve the presumption of innocence and his view and it could set a bad precedent for men down the line if Kavanaugh is denied\nYou know a Supreme Court seat in this case or ... kind of virtue of presuming that have been guilty um so it's kind of it\nProblem and that women deserve to be heard or they deserve to be believed he kind of trying to flip that around and say well what about the young man what about the young boys who worry that they could be all the accused of something I'm like all that is of course the argument here not about\nHaving a street under is not a criminal trial where you go to jail is not whether you get the promotions so the standard or ... you know in in the view that as a as a critic should be higher\nYeah meanwhile are very quickly I Want to ask you very quickly about the New York times story which did this major investigation alleging among other things that Donald Trump's of wealth was not self made but it was the result of a huge fortunate he inherited from his dad and and probably because\nAccording to the times he engaged in a series of suspect tax schemes\nNow another time in history and obligation like this against a sitting president would be seen as a huge deal how was the White House responded to this\nYeah there's a lot to unpack the times called it outright fraud I talked to a bunch of tax lawyers and found that\nUm you know the the activities that you are a organization engaged and chew 'em you know limit the amount of estate taxes that Trump would have paid for instance or a very much outside the bounds of the law into according to the times reporting and it also it goes against President Trump's\nArgument that he is a self made man that has well was only the only a tiny bit of it in his words wasn't inherited when that does not appear to be the case according to this investigation the White House has responded by a\nBy lashing out by attacking the times by talking to press kind of a a familiar ... used in the [noise] right\nWell so he'll cup or national political reporter for Bloomberg Politics thank you so much for joining us today we're very grateful\nThank you\nAll right now the testimonies of ah the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh are at odds on to say the least Ford says she has a hundred percent confident she was assaulted by Kavanaugh when they were in high school\nBut Kavanaugh vehemently denies that it ever happened one way to reconcile the opposing narratives is the so called blackouts theory that Kavanaugh did it but doesn't remember because he blacked out from drinking too much in last friday Senate hearing prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\nBrought up the possibility when she asked Kavanaugh this question have you ever pass out from drinking\n[noise] I Love salad would be no but I've gone to sleep but I've never blacked out that's the that's the the allegation a and a sense that's wrong\nBut what exactly is a black what do we know about it the answer these questions we're joined by Dr Richard said he's chair of Boston University school of public health department of community health sciences\nAnd an addiction medicine specialist knee joined us from the school of public a health a doctor say it's good to have you thanks for being with us sure it's a pleasure to be here\nSo can we just start with the basic definition if one exists ... what does it mean to blackout first\nYou know I mean the the question that you heard asked there was really the wrong question it's not the same and this is a key point it's not the same as passing out ... blackout is when there's something that you don't remember\nAnd it happened when you were drinking and it happens when you drink a lot very quickly something that might happen in a drinking game when you drink ten or Fifteen shots one and a half ounces of eighty proof liquor something in that range\nA and to all around you you appear normal or intoxicated that is that yours you're walking and talking and responding to cues and your environment and and people who are with you\nAre but later the next day or someone asks if you remember what happened some specific event and you don't recall it matters blackout so what\nDoes that mean in terms of what's happening chemically in the brain that we're walking and functioning I mean maybe were stumbling around a little bit maybe are words are were slurring are words a little bit but your point is we appear to be conscious conscious essentially but we don't remember a big chunk of what happened so what's going on with the brain\nYou know I mean I I think that we used to believe that alcohol is simply base the brain and had sort of a general effect\nOn the entire brain and and that is true at very high levels\nBut it seems to have some specific effects on receptors and narrow the transmission and a while I Can't really tell you the exact nerve transmission that's that's involved here\nWhat we do know is that there are parts of the brain and involved in learning and making either short term or longer term memory that are affected and what happens here is the person knows what's going on but the experience doesn't get put into long term memory\nSo they might remember that if you're there in front of somebody and you ask them what happened just now just one minute ago they can tell you but if you ask them the next day it's not there because\nUh the hippocampus as a part of the brain where we're learning happens and it doesn't stay there for the long term\n... so do we know ah something about who experience of these these blackout sooner words are some people who drink more susceptible to them than others\nYankees but if they play the athletic she's not quite willing to make that commitment so it really could kind of depend on who the hitters are which team they're facing and all that he also talked about the home field advantage how much the team loves playing at Fenway they hit better there\nUh the crowd obviously helps give them energy as they go forward right yeah I mean that's got to be a huge in this in the red Sox did incredibly well it's in ... park the season yesterday seven and twenty four on the air\nSo what about Chris say all the teams ac had a couple of students on the disabled list he didn't seem to be throwing as well when he came off the disabled list toward the end of the season ... what do you\nSay about him so Alex course that he is not at all worried and he's a hundred percent sure that sale is going to be ready to go come playoff time but I think yeah exactly [laughter] I think it's important to look at the contacts there you're talking about he went on a ...\nA he came back for one started against Baltimore through Ninety eight Ninety nine miles an hour and then went almost immediately back on the DL with shoulder information and since coming back that second time his velocity has really been down\nA court said that specifically in this final started against Baltimore last Wednesday that or what he saw out a sale actually despite the performance in the down velocity was pretty encouraging\nThe fact that when the game was on the line and the last one and he hit Ninety for a few times it wasn't Ninety nine but he went from eighty eight eighty nine to Ninety four I Know is there I Know is there and the fact that he came to me right away you know after the game is over and he he\nHe felt that in the ... and he saw it on the video I'm like okay you know this was this was mechanics\nSo or whether it's mechanics or an injury there is no doubt about the fact that silk velocity has been noticeably down\nIn that Baltimore start last week his fastball average just over Ninety miles an hour that's the lowest average basketball of his entire career ... you're scaring me we've got to move on to the New England patriots a for a moment or two of the patriots quieted critics on Sunday by blowing up the Miami Dolphins thirty eight to seven\nThe pets are now two and two on the air how big was that when for them on Sunday\nThere was actually a huge win what you're saying something for September football uh I've been a patriots fan for a long time as well the steam always kind of struggles out the gate and by November or December their clicking on all cylinders but had they lost to Miami they would have been down three games to a division opponent that is a tough hill to climb in a ... game season\nAre so I got to ask you a quickly before uh we go about\nUh Celtics dark Kyrie Irving he made headlines last year when he sat on a pod cast that he believed the earth was flat he's given different answers since then about whether we actually believe that or not but he addressed it at the Forbes under thirty some ad on Monday what do you say well\nInteresting I bet you didn't think we'd be talking flatter than a sports uh he's gone back and forth about whether or not he was initially joking he seemed to finally uh admit that he did genuinely believe this when he started at the time at\nThe time I was like ... and the conspiracies everybody's been there [noise]\n\nYou know what's going on with our world\nYou know like how these the ...\nEven went on to apologize to science teachers everywhere [laughter] right so he's climbed out of that flat earth a rabbit on the radio Boston's Chris that are expressed thanks so much for like ...\nFinally tonight we want to bring you another sample of WB you are in the Boston Globe's new investigative podcast called last seen it goes deep into the unsolved mystery of the world's largest unsolved art heist at

Aleppo takes a particular interest in the Gardner heist it isn't only because he feels the loss of what was stolen it's also because he just might know who did it no other defense attorney has represented more criminals who have been tied if only unofficially\nTo the gardener case seven and all they are men Aleppo has long defended for other crimes\nAnd while he won't comment on what they might have known about the plan to steal some of the most valuable and bill loved treasures from Isabella Stewart gardeners collection he will say this about whoever pulled off the robbery\nThis was done by a bunch of ... 'cause this was very well organized well organized ... every single thing\nBy day let that means the FBI\nAnd he's right in the twenty eight and a half years since the highest they haven't found any of the stolen masterpieces but one of the places the FBI has been looking at the longest reveals a lot about who they think might be behind this still unsolved crime\nIt's a car repair shop called T.

feels like a holiday when you come out with his own thank you for that so what inspired the story was there a germ of an idea that sort of haunted you and give them to go on so long\nYeah well that's exactly the word haunted I um\nIt came from a a project I was working on a it was a a screen play I was researching and it was about a real intimate doing real time in ...\nAnd it's an interesting story and in in that process I found myself in Chicago interviewing people who'd known him for years and one was a man who was a whole who I enjoyed having lunch with he was in his sixties he was kind of quiet and unassuming and\nA warm and really gave me a lot of good stuff to work with and I took a bunch of notes and a bottom lunch and as I was paying the bill I said I forgive me I guess I just have to ask what what'd you do time\nSaid oh I killed my wife and I just you know you have you read my memoir Tony I have a particular hatred for for male violence against women and and kids and\nAnd so I just took a breath and just want to get the hell out of that restaurant and but I I said well do you have kids and he said oh yeah but they don't want to see me and that's what lodged in my psyche I couldn't get out of my head for three or four years it just circled in my head this\nThis notion of well you've done the worst thing possible to know a human being one who you vowed to love and care for by the way yeah you have a child or children with that person you still love the kids\nAnd I I just couldn't get that out and and so I had to write my way into it in five years later
