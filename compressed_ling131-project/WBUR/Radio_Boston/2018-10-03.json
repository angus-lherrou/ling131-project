originally aired earlier today\n\nMrs rainy of all and I'm Deborah Becker if you think the criminal justice system is biased should you be barred from sitting on a jury that was the threat of a question before the Massachusetts Supreme judicial court today in\nThe case of a juror who was dismissed after saying that she believes the criminal justice system is arrayed against African American males\nJoining us on the line to talk about this is judge Nancy Gardner retired federal judge in senior lecturer at Harvard law school she's also WB or legal analyst and she wrote an abacus brief in this case Hi Nancy Hi so so let's get a little bit of background here after searching an apartment in Brockton police found cocaine\nAnd they charged Clinton Williams and African American man with possession with intent to distribute now during jury selection for millions trial a prospective juror was asked if she might have bias\nAnd she said yes because she worked with low income used including teenagers convicted of drug crimes and she also said she does think that the criminal justice system is unfair to young black males\nThe prosecutor asked that should be excused the judge dismissed or for cars so what's wrong with that\nOne thing about it this way\nIf she had said for example that I Believe that the criminal justice system is always fair and that the outcome is always correct we would not have recused start even though that's not true we would not have disqualified her even though that's not true and so to some degree this is a statement\nThat is a general statement which actually is is also true that is to say that the criminal justice system is unfair too\nThe problem was there was another question that the judge should've asked which is having that in mind having that in in in your view would you be able to be um would you be able to be fair in this case in other words one can have a general view of the of the criminal justice system but nevertheless said this is what I Would do\nIn a particular case we do that in the death penalty sending all the time what's your opinion about the death penalty well I Am generally oppose well do you think that you could impose it if the facts require it yes\nThat second question is the bias question because that is saying this set of ideas would be an impediment to by being fair in this case but general\nViews about the criminal justice system on either side should be in a different category\n... says so basically would you say are the guidelines for determining potential bias and a potential juror the fitness of a juror I mean it it can people can have all kinds of opinions and I would assume that you would want a variety of opinions among the jury pool so\nGoals us embassy a sort of just work and [noise]\nSell what's in this new deal and what will it mean for American workers and companies\nWell joining us to talk about this as the Boston Globe's click steady columnist Evan Horowitz an unwelcome several happy fundraising so you know thank you well know versus eleven let's not talk about that right after that when you call this NAFTA to point out what do you mean\nWell I mean I guess we should start with what the heck to call it I mean is it after two point oh is it the U.S MCI after the next rests on like the village people the U.S MCA a smoker um it really seems like we should keep calling it NAFTA because it's mostly NAFTA\nThe changes are slight non trivial but slight and the basic framework remains in place low tariffs among the three nations of North America\nSo so let's talk about some of the some of the changes even if they are slight the babies are dairy auto what are the big ...\nYeah so well it depends what you mean by big ... of the goals of the Trump Administration was able to accomplish include some increased access to the Canadian dairy market candidate has traditionally made it very difficult for other countries to export dairy and agriculture\nAnd now some dairy farmers will be able to export more cheese a little more milk more sort of dry milk powder that's easier to transport um so that's a slight gain we're talking about fractions of a percentage point in trade for a teen number of jobs but it's something that you mentioned really cared about and the got it\nAnd the next thing is some new incentives to make sure auto manufacturers build their cars in the U.S instead of a in low wage factories in Mexico and\nSo is this good for Canada is it good for Canada I mean again the big picture is it doesn't change all that much Canadian dairy farmers are not happy but it's not going to affect them and it's a different way and the Canadians got something in exchange for that which is\nThe ability to continue either exporting were dumping depending on your perspective suffered lumber this has been an ongoing American complaint about Canada they subsidize their lumber industry and then the excess ends up back in the United states under price and it hurts loggers and a lumber industry in the U. S.\nUh and the Trump Administration loan with previous administrations tried to end pieces of NAFTA that made this possible they didn't so the Canadians get keep subsidizing exporting lumber they have to give up a little bit of a except a little bit more in the way up there and\nWhat about this independent tariff dispute settlements system that was involved so\nThat's okay so they're there to to think about here one is the kind of look lumber problem\nOr can the nation's contest each other when\nThey dump and the answer is it's very hard to do and it's still very hard to do the other is the investor or state settlement process that's like companies who are really unhappy about some new law in Mexico or Canada\nThere was a system where they had their own special courts where they could go and contests these laws that are passed by parliaments\nAnd they could win rulings from court special courts outside of a normal court system\nOf this has gotten increasingly\nUm controversial in light of ... in other places for instance you've had cigarette companies that will soon nations for anti smoking campaigns any special courts and so they've gotten really unpopular and that mostly went away there's still one exception which is different oil and gas company in Mexico decides to nationalize the gas industry you'll still be alive to complain\nBut apart from that no that's gone and not actually could be a big deal it's something that the business lobby in the United states cared about they may continue to lobby against the new NAFTA\nWill see so this is a victory for the way\nI think if nothing else it shows that I think it counts as the first real evidence that Trump's a scorched earth or some ... um foreign policy negotiating strategy can pay off\nA he has taken well he's levy tariffs against Canada and Mexico he threatened to throw out the agreement he threatened further terrorist he then split the negotiation refused to negotiate with both at the same time to go kind of divide and conquer strategy or this generated a lot of resentment but then it ended in an agreement\nAnd I think until now it's been hard to point\nAnd it goes shading posture aggressive as it is can work but now he can you can say yes we got this agreement I think that's a big deal I think that's a big deal for the agreement and in some ways just reinforces his tendency to acted belligerent ways with other countries\nAnd this led through Sunday this deal than it was sort of ... this was a deadline right while the\n... ... it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a deadline you know it's like\nUm it was a self imposed deadline and the reason it was ... just because well there are elections coming up in Mexico and we really want to get the new deal signed before the new government comes into Mexico because they may not like it\nSo this is a very strange part of this whole thing is you've got a new president who's already been elected in Mexico but hasn't taken office takeoffs in December and they're trying to rush this through before she take office\nIn fear that he may oppose it so there's a kind of anti democratic ... an outright and Jim a credit but there are sort of playing with against democratic systems in other countries to make the move is fast that's the only reason we have this deadline\nIt thought these this deal still needs to be approved\nIt needs to be approved by all three countries I got easier and Canada and Mexico when you're parliamentary systems it's harder on the west though I'm there won't be a vote until January that's because these kinds of deals\nHave long vetting requirements congressman tickets times going to look I have to by law so they may not vote until after the midterms and after the new Congress comes to DC in January which means you could see Democrats who control the house getting a vote on this deal\nUm I still think they'll vote for it but it'll be an interesting test\nA and magic ...\nShe not it I mean I I enjoy matter and on our listeners who can't see a [laughter] basically the challenge will be people if the Democrats take control of the house it will be on a wave of anti Trump sentiment right so they will come in and it will be very hard for them to vote for a Trump trade deal like a smoker\nUm US MCA or NAFTA or whatever calling it\nA on the other hand this trade deal is not a big deal there aren't big reasons to oppose it\nAnd the few changes that do exist aligned with some democratic priorities like are there are tighter of their better protections for workers in Mexico that's something that Democrats support why would they vote against ...\nOkay well it'll be interesting Evan Horwitz quick study columnist for the Boston Globe thanks so much for coming in thank you to stay with us there's more ahead\nAnd I'm Deborah Becker this is radio Boston oh\nFrom Boston University this or not he point nine W.

B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\n\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker with deep divisions over the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh we spent some time today talking about how young people are processing this controversy and this cultural moment\nA Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday said forty eight percent of American voters most believe Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford forty one percent\nMost believe Brett Kavanaugh and today President Trump said this\nIs a very scary time for young men in America would you be a you'll see of something that you may not be guilty of\nThat how does this divide effect teenagers particularly when it comes to talking with them about sexual assault and consent joining us in Studio ... mega rebel she's founder and director of partners in sex education in Oregon\nInto schools cross Massachusetts Hi thanks for coming in hello thanks so much for having me unless there is we want to hear from you have you talked with your children about these hearings and what do you tell them what do you tell teenagers about their Brett Kavanaugh\nHearings and the Senate Judiciary committee hearings and they're related controversy that's been going on since the hearing the end it looked as education around sex and consent looked like in your school\nThey would feel regretful embarrassed humiliated or ashamed of the next day including him\nAnd I think there's a way to help people understand that not only somebody saying yes because again\nIt's not like going to a movie but if you tell you what's going to this will they won't let alone then I'll like it oh come on let's give it a try it's not the same kind of thing so getting enthusiastic and said like yes this is something they're both ready for that both interested in the both willing to try\nIt I think they can get a little more clear to not cross those lines that people well she said okay and\nMy also so ... is there are those good guidelines ... thank\nYou Helene that was an amazingly um articulate explanation of enthusiastic consent I particularly like your description of how somebody feels about it later that somebody should not be doing things that they are and shamed of\nUm [noise] uh and and all of those other things so I Love that description I Do want to address\nUm the the idea that we have comprehensive way of ... in Massachusetts I um would love to know what community or an on an because it sounds like it is does a great job\nUm with comprehensive sexuality education however Massachusetts as a whole is very inconsistent because Massachusetts does not have any required\nUm curriculum and is one of the about\nHalf of the states in the nation that requires no kind of sexual health\nUm curriculum doesn't require a anything at all only eight states in the nation require consent curriculum and Massachusetts certainly not one of them and I just wanted to say that we had tried to pass last year the healthy youth act\nAnd the healthy youth act would have\nRequired not that schools had sex ed but that if they had sex ed it'd be medically accurate\nAge appropriate and inclusive\nAnd so that means maps to the national sex ed standards it has to be true and it has to be gender and orientation inclusive\nIt does sound as if uh you may have that in your community so I think that's excellent but I Hope that we can get all the communities to catch up in Massachusetts and so right now than in the schools that you work in I mean are there wide differences\nAre among schools in terms of what students are taught so uh partners\nIn sex education um goes to a wide variety of schools including some public schools and charter schools although the bulk of the schools that we go to our independence schools\nUm public schools are very inconsistent\nAnd whether they have sex education and this is largely based on whether they have a health teacher who is committed to sex education and who I can do content education and all of these things I strongly recommend having health teacher um because that is the person who is the most well\nVersed in social emotional\nLearning okay well maybe that's the topic of our our next show mega rebel founder and director of partners in sex education and organization that delivers sex education in schools across the state thanks for being with us and thank you so much\n[noise]\nFinally tonight we want to bring you another sample of WB you are in the Boston Globe's new investigative podcast titled last seen it looks at the unsolved mystery of the world's largest art heist\nAt Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum last night we brought you the first part of episode to warehouse Kelly horn and jak wrote all ego began exploring the idea what if the Gardner heist was an inside job tonight in the second half\nWe learn about some strange behavior of security guard Rick ...\nTwenty minutes before ap as opposed to the into the museum the alarms we'd have tells us he opened and closed the same door why would have done that was he's signaling the bad guys investigators have wondered whether you're saying hey the coast is clear or was it as Rick Avon has always said it was\nJust something he did every night to make sure the doors alarm was working\nWith what I was a good writer [noise] loves the alarm off the door of a real or let him go [laughter]\nI don't care what he says there's no way\nJohn Paul Kroger trained the guards including ... for the overnight shift at the Gardner Museum\nThat right there is a huge risk it makes no sense that you would allow yourself to why in the world would you open that up there's a camera outside that shows palace road there's no reason in the world why you would ever open the door\nSo if you could somehow be proved that added opened and closed the outside door every time he worked the overnight than is opening the night of the highest looks a lot less\nIn two thousand ten Rob Fisher the assistant us attorney in charge of the guard your investigation had an idea ... to security changed from the night before the robbery when Rick Abbott was also an dating show me that Abbott opened and closed the door that night and I believe that he did it as a matter of course\nWhat did you see when you when you watch the video from the night before\nIt was not a guard checking to make sure the doors were secure and long it was somebody being let in after hours and being let in you know where the robbers when ...\nMost exactly twenty four hours later oh\nSo the surveillance footage from the night before the Gardner heist does show I gather opening the door\nWhen the U.S attorney's office released the surveillance video twenty five years after the ice and they did so with a public appeal who is this man it was the closest thing to a bombshell that we've had and the gardener mystery was it a bad guy was it a dry run for the robbery how we finally going to solve this thing\nWell no and now and now we know who came in the night before\nYes who is it\nA it's a personal we've identified and we are actually certainly ... entry was not connected to the highest in any way shape or form\nAnthony I'm Laurie won't id the night before a visitor but three former security guards we interviewed confirmed the identity as well as a source close to the investigation demanding question was the Gardner Museum deputy director of security it turns out recap it was just letting in his boss\nBut John Paul Kroger who trained the guards for their third shift duties says no one was to be let into the museum after hours after not your boss not even cops\nThe protocol was very straightforward name and badge number calling verify their identity and then if there's a legitimate reason for them to be there then only you let them in a wreck has made some statements that they were never trained on that that's completely false\nThe other guard on duty tonight if the heist the one we're only calling by his first name Randy says security at the gardening museum was lax\nOh dear member or somebody order pizza or some kind of food delivery and they're just posed a write in when they came to the side door it looked like the kind of thing was done there all the time\nBy not guards give Randy as he says he did witness a pizza delivery guy being ... into the museum in the middle of the night how tight put that security protocol have been\nCertain people really did take their job seriously and then others really did not\nCynthia de just worked at the Gardner Museum as a security guard at the time the heist to hear her tail it if there was a rule against late night visitors wasn't followed not even by the gardeners than director and Holly\nShe had had dinner with people and brought the men after dinner like at ten o'clock at night or later she would bring people into the museum and go into the galleries that breaks that\nThat mindset that breaks that chain of command do not let anyone in after five well\nWhat is a guard on underlying supposed to then do\nSo why is this a big deal\nWhy can't the museum director comment at night to walk through the galleries with a trusted friend\nWhy can't the deputy security director come in and chat with the guard well it's a very big deal according to security experts what if the director at the door is under duress with a gun to her head\nWhat if there is a bad guy just beyond view of the security camera waiting for his chance to slip into the museum\nThat's why you would never let anyone in after hours the simpler the rule the easier it is to follow no one means no one\nJoke gift Abbott's own bosses broke the rule is it fair to blame him for breaking it too\nAnd does all this door opening business say more about the state of security at the Gardner Museum than it does about ...\nOne eight hundred nine zero nine nine to a seven you can

might you pledge thank you so much\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Anthony Brooks and we're going to touch down in Washington to catch up with a fast moving story about\nEmbattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh an FBI investigation into allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were in high school is expected to wrap up this week Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell expect there to be a vote to confirm\nMeanwhile President Trump who'd been somewhat restrained in his comments about all this\nShifted tone yesterday at a political rally in Mississippi where he mocked lousy Ford\nI have one right I Want to be\nWell you know there was one of ... how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't [noise]\n\nHubble can Senator Susan Collins of Maine Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska all key swing votes in this nomination fight\nCriticize the president Collins calling his comments just plain wrong Murkowski calling them appalling joining us now from Washington is so he'll ... poor national political reporter for ... for Bloomberg Politics so he'll uh good to have you thanks for being on the show\nHey Anthony thanks for having me you don't want to ask you about the president who's been as we mentioned somewhat restrained about all of\nThis but then yesterday he sort of return to form what kind of reaction has there been to this attack on Christine Blasey Ford [noise]\nRight well they were reaction on Capitol Hill is as you can imagine an overall pretty negative Democrats are very critical of his remarks several Republicans as you pointed out those three key votes like Murkowski Holland's also critical of president\nBut it remains unclear that that changes the calculus in any meaningful way each senator these Republican senators you just mentioned are not going to\nYou know cast their votes on the ... or something the president says there are a ... a ... you know thinking of a lot more complicated\nRight well I Want to talk a little bit about Senator Jeff flake who was in Boston on Monday and talked about the importance of uh\nYesterday at the Atlantic festival in Washington he raised concerns about the partisan nature of Kavanaugh's testimony last friday here here's a bit of what he said\nIt was very troubled by the tone of the remarks the initial defense the judge Kavanaugh gave\nI Hope that I Would sound that ... if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on and the interaction with some members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me we can't have this on the court so\nInteresting about that so he was when I heard Senator Flake in Boston a on Monday he was a little more restrained than that comment or which is pretty forceful a saying that we can't have this on the court what what are you hearing that comment\nWell this has become a big part of the whole debate surrounding Kavanaugh one of the um main democratic arguments is that his credibility came in the question that hearing about his temperament ... not very judicial and otherwise he lashed out you know he was angry with low the village rent at times\nUm he in other words the flakes sounded like what an innocent man would sound like if he's accused but still the argument is is that how it should sound ... artist and then um you know attitude so I that's been a big part of the ...\nPart of the discussion that's been I'm a huge part of the criticism coming forward that even if he is innocent\nCan someone like Brett Kavanaugh will be trusted to rule and to judge him partially if he's expressing the overtly art invent them and then of course the question and others are asking is is he going to hold a grudge as a result\nRight right ... interesting that flake is bringing that up he's of course one of the the the key swing votes last friday he was the one who sort of shocked the world when he pushed for a delay to allow the FBI investigation\nSo what do we know about ah the FBI investigation so far first of all when do we know when it's expected to conclude one we might see something about it from it will we see something from it\nI've heard some chatter amongst senators today that it could wrap up as early as today and uh the the report with first go to the White House and pretty soon it would be here on Capitol Hill with the according to\nSenate majority leader McConnell available for every senator to look at try to lead won't be released to the public however we don't know exactly when that's going to end the FBI has not been a you know speaking publicly about this investigation as it usually doesn't but\nEveryone is is kind of anxious to see when it comes out and people are on guard perhaps to potentially land today if not later\nRight and so he'll water lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez who who is also made allegations against judge Kavanaugh what are they saying about the FBI investigation so far\nThey are arguing that the FBI is not conducting a thorough investigation that it's not following up on a request from them or for follow up and\nFor interviews to speak with the FBI is that it hasn't you know pursued other leaders that they consider relevant to the investigation or tried to contact other witnesses that they believe you know could corroborate um or at least shed some light on the other allegations here so they have said publicly\nThat um that they you know they worry the FBI hands or being tied and that it's not conducting a thorough investigation and that was concerned that the ... and may have had announced critics here on Capitol Hill\nThat's a mistake but there's also this sort of disbelief that someone could entirely forget something a traumatic or something serious that might have happened and and that isn't the case you ... you really can forget in a blackout the other thing that strikes me that really struck me about the interaction\nIs a I think everybody would agree that when he was asked about his alcohol use that he was quite annoyed at the question he seemed angry about it and annoyed that somebody might be accusing him of drinking too much\nAnd it turns out that one of the medical questionnaires that we used to detect alcohol use disorder\nOr one of the questions is about if you've ever been annoyed when people ask you about or criticize your drinking I'm not suggesting that he has an alcohol use disorder he may or he may not I can't diagnose that up but it is a feature and it raises that question I I also wouldn't suggest that heavy drinking disqualifies anyone from\nHaving an important job as many people with alcohol use disorder or fully employed and quite successful\nOr but it does it raise that question for me\nWell it's interesting too because if you look at this for example from a judge Kavanaugh's point of view if he's absolutely convinced that he didn't do this\nI'm Andy had a blackout I mean he sort of being asked to prove a negative I mean he's certainly didn't do it if he had a blackout he wouldn't remembered if he did so it sort of puts him in this peculiar situation as well if he is innocent\nLife right I think in that case if if if he understood what a blackout was and he understood that it could happen if you drank heavily and rapidly then he would have to at least be open to the possibility that he did something terrible and didn't remember it you know and and that's why I mentioned before\nCurrent blackouts uh and and have a more serious condition alcohol use disorder often feel guilty that they may have done something and they and they feel regret about it and say gee you know I I I really don't remember it but if I did that I'm really sorry about it right\nWell well this has been really fascinating I'm a doctor Richard states he's chair of Boston University school of public health department of community health sciences and he's an addiction medicine specialist Dr ... thanks so much for joining us that I really appreciate it\nHas very glad to join you thanks
