explain to viewers why they were coloring certain states on the map red and certain ones blue\nRed states are states we have for Jeff as having those ... are regulatory shows with\nExplained in detail there by the network news now fast forward to election night sixteen years later a far more dramatic event the two thousand presidential race was the closest the country had ever seen\nFan bars fan by CNN right now is moving [noise] our earlier that ration of Florida [noise] back to the [noise] too close to call call off\nNow that's the night that red and blue clashed into their current meetings that night when Florida was blue than it was too close to call and it was read then unknown\n... started to hang and then Bush Gore you might remember that it's also the night according to my guest Steve corner ... when our increasingly divisive politics came to a head\nAnd established America's polarized identity as the red and the blue and in fact that is the name of his new book they're reading the blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism\nSteve ... is the author he's MSNBC and NBC News national political correspondent\nAnd he's in the studio with me Steve it's a pleasure to have you it's great to be here things have me Steve we're going to talk a lot about fascinating political history we're also going to talk about where we are now in our politics or electoral politics the house the Senate the Kavanaugh hearings which have captivated American undercurrents of the politics there\nBut let's go back to two thousand because we just took it down into those memories of hanging chads and Bush Gore and the recount in Florida and the Supreme Court deciding the results of an election\nUm that's where your book begins and also where it ends why was that such a pivotal moment for political ideology America yeah no I mean I I think it's the two thousand election to me which\nIs you as close to a perfect time I think as we're ever going to see in a presidential election\nUm it was the perfect combination of the nineties all of the political wars of the Nineteen nineties Bill Clinton Newt Gingrich Hillary care Ross Perot pitchforks Pat Buchanan impeachment all of these these major battles these major forces\nThat shape politics created this division that\nWhen you looked at that map on election night two thousand and you saw the entire south with now painted red red for Republicans the entire northeast\nMinus New Hampshire barely a was painted blue for Democrats the Pacific coast you could see these\nThe stark geographic boundaries and they were more than geographic they were they were cultural boundaries they were demographic boundaries and I think the nineties really to me it's the decades those colors sync up with the parties those colors took on a partisan meaning political meaning in people's show sides\nAnd it's almost ... two tribes were formed red and blue and and I think that framework\nComes from the station and

org and from the listeners who support this NPR station\nThis is one eight on Todd's will like I'm Talking to MSNBC and NBC News national correspondent Steve ... about his new book the red and the blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism well here is one well remembered moment from the nineties I take you back to president almost president at this point Bill Clinton\nYou answer that question is I've never broken state law\nAnd the experiment and ... didn't like it didn't inhale and they're trying to do\n[laughter] Bill Clinton and the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two are the deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale it Oxford was probably true because he knew first hand that Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible forum\nThat's what ... used to say he was no friend Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nWe heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most visited issues since the civil war and we still have never recovered\nAnd not ... tweets us on where I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America I remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today and non partisan\nA Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment and tribalism in politics\nWhere we are right now I Want to talk about and Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during the impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager he helped impeach Bill Clinton and then ... before the Senate to make the case has a prosecutor that Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the rec having hearings ... angrily defended cab and he said the other day and the hearings I think everybody saw it I'm a single white male people want me to shut up\nAnd I won't shut up and he was red face and he was furious on behalf of ... cabinet and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve\nHere ... Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee ... the Republican point\nYou're the speaker that the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that were for you have ... good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking\nAs far as [noise] back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as the Republican Party the future meeting Republicans\nHad your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week\nI'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it any more\nStunning what does this transformation that Lindsey Graham ... vacation in the ... you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I'm ... tells\nMe that the divide this deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kinda drawn ... that you saw and the two thousand election they say that we've lived with sense\nYou're only going deeper and the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was ... you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's lost ... Obama and concluded what Lindsey Graham ... demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were gonna change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tentative this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just the one the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race ... called him a kooky called him a bunch of things um in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how ... resonated with their voters it told them where there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want ... understand\n... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death now with this party\nSo what is Lindsay Gramm thinking now is he thinking I have to win the Republican primary and twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp ... the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what's he think yeah I mean look\nThere's ... there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but ... I'll give you a couple of them that ... that that jumped out at me what is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about the Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons of Donald Trump's rise and his ... during popularity with republic\nOffice holders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you go off with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors expressed their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties\nVery tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you\n... what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be a political science they the voters who go and they\nA Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot just election two election that that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization the driver was All right let's get\nBack in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner to speak or as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house if you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run then I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at uh the well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill\nYeah there there in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play may say well what was the big deal to deal with Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet for this you know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here was Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nBeating the speaker of the house she was at that point eight Seventy two year old old school Boston politician Tip O'Neill\nMan of the house beating him into a fight on the floor of the house of Neal actually left the speakers rose from came down to the floor that have stood to debate Gingrich and and we have that very sound here's Tip O'Neill and his response\n\n\n\nSupport\nFor NPR I'm is from this session\nAnd from the Ford Foundation working with visionaries on the front lines of social change worldwide to address inequality in all its forms

define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington it's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and here's one\nAnd the president is right in many ways we are a shining city on it for the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and or if there is this fair Mr President and the faces that you don't see\nThem places that you don't visit and you're a shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another\nMoment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any [noise]\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him well for for for any off before that year presidential candidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talking about how\nPoliticians grappled with media coverage during those years achieve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and in a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nIt was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point versus Ross Perot [laughter] begging place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried I was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two\nHad was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li ... scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall\nWhich was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd and it was Ninety two it wasn't just arson you Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion ... really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King large came in and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent in just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers committed two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018",
