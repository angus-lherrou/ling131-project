Johnson in Washington Congress is often deadlocked on legislation but there is lots of action happening at the state level from immigration to gun control state houses and governors are passing bills and voters are proven ballot initiatives\nToday we're launching a special series called the state we're in\nEach Monday This month we'll explore the bills and ballot initiatives dominating the debates in state capitals what are the state level trends tell us about the political direction of the country\nThis time around we'll explore trends in gun legislation and proposals around the nation today also marks one year since the mass shooting in Las Vegas at an open air country music festival it left fifty eight people dead and hundreds of people wounded\nAfter that shooting many people called for more gun control measures particularly on bump stocks some states passed bump stock restrictions other major restrictions went nowhere\nBut this year some things shifted after another mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida a gunman walked into that school and killed Seventeen students and staff\nThat sparked a movement led by students survivors in states around the nation started restricting got access including some states with Republican governors\nJoining us in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to one day thanks very much for having me joining us from NPR in New York is Chris Brown ... president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence Chris welcome\nThank you so much and joining us from Texas Public radio in San Antonio is Richard Feldman the president of the independent firearm owners association he's a former lobbyist for the n._r._a. and he's the author of Rick uh Shay confessions of a gun lobbyist Richard thanks for making time for ... thank you\nWe should note that we have made attempts every single week to invite the president of the n._r._a. on this program we are eager to hear\nFrom Mr Oliver North thus far or in treaties have gone unanswered but that invitation still stands Scott Greenberg let me start with you this has been a heck of a year for the gun control movement and also the gun rights movement in the U.S\nGive us the broad overview of what's been going on as I understand that there are about fifty new laws restricting gun access that move forward including and fourteen states that have Republican governors right\nThat's right and uh we tracked this since the shooting in Parkland, Florida a last February because uh it what we found and this is really interesting was that up until Parkland even with uh the many other mass shootings unfortunately that have taken place\nA that for the most part states reacted by expanding gun rights I'm up until Parkland Parkland seems to have shifted something or perhaps a because these students there um\nBecame so politically active it's so outspoken a so quickly or that following that um [noise] incident it seems that ah states have moved from the other direction as you noted\nTomorrow at noon on nine point

trends this year in New state gun laws and proposals part one of our new series the state we're in we're speaking to Scott Greenberg or executive editor of state line Chris Brown the co president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence and Richard Feldman president of the independent firearm owners association\nRichard by the way before we keep going we mentioned that you are a former lobbyist for the un already\nThat firearm owners association for those who may not have heard of it that's that's a separate organization from NRA right or is it affiliated or is there any relationship no just clarify\nNo relationship between the two I headed up the firearm industry's trade association during the Nineteen nineties\nGotcha okay thank you I just wanted to make sure we're kind of clear on on the the distinction between your organization and the and the n._r._a. Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we could talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag ball Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back\nOn Democrats given the rate of ways so this is an unprecedented in terms of getting vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm In the Jerry Brown has a governed as a a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise]\nUh you know in this case he felt like it perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh\nIt went a little too too far um and a return and it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um post a Parkland has focused on\nA these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers\nYou know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a guns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um uh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view as their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more ah controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the end are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus reading from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for and support\nWhat is known as red flag legislation in general this policy would allow family members for law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by a judge which were prohibited individual\nFrom having any firearms or ammunition\nIf the judge has clear evidence that the family member foes was a an immediate and present danger um ah causing injury to themselves or to others [noise] individuals with a mental illness should not have access to firearms period\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that he's a minus rating from the n._r._a. drops to a seat\nAs a result of huge support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact you think that that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan actually there eh he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact\nOn his NRA rating and has an impact on decorating decorating gets them as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that had been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately or the you know the second Amendment rights says of gun owners\nWest at the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job is getting polling data back and focus group information that really appealed to difference\nAbout these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot\nOne of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet and and that is a very concerning thank the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions\nSay certainly applied governor Hogan forgiving the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want and moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nI hear you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean ... was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April Vermont's governor Phil Scott who was a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nNobody's got said he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled and alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house he was being heckled by opponents to gun restrictions listen\nI support the second amendment [noise]\nOur way you can really gearing everything we can make our kids in our community safe [noise]\nWhere our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put them on a bus\nHer police the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in to prevent a loved one in life [noise] and\nPart of the signing ceremony on the steps of the Vermont state house with Vermont governor Phil Scott who is a Republican Richard Feldman Philbin when you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country\nWell I think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow\nCornered itself by its own success on the politics of this issue transcends the policy of this issue and therein lies so much of the problem in getting this to be focused in a way\nThat we can achieve results that\nWork for everyone and we can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy we really have to align those two and dealing with the perceptions versus the realities in this society it's highly\nUnlikely that anyone you or I Know directly is going to be shot it's a statistical thing but of course it's gonna make news and we're all I'm\nIn the same boat when when we see things day in and day out we feel it gets all around us we deal as human beings with these perceptions um for so long now um\nSupport for NPR chemist from discussion and

continues here on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Richard Feldman Chris Brown and Scott Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up we should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing long guns and rifles for states\nFor the past new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican sponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on W F for TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that you have an Eighteen year old a who did purchase his wife and I think without that partake in fact he probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what do you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being\nFor what particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in the mall so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not unfair that even at those ages\nThat state rep Hosea will leave out in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYes than our as challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the\nNRA for a long time um had as suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will know that Florida passed a package of laws or the minimum age being one\nAll of which were a really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nRat has long been one of the strongest a sort of incubator ... of the ... legislative agenda and I think it's very telling\nOn obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to save storage in a moment but there were ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which\nA state representative who joined us showed us one of these safe storage lockers that does open with your fingerprint I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find that conversation online at our website the one a dot org before we move on to other kinds\nOf gun legislation Richard Feldman because I just get your sense in terms of\nThe ... real view on gun legislation DNA has said that so measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just see the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more can fifth wheel and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first let's define something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a. ... member of the n._r._a. there five million and already members\nUm there's the board of directors is the senior leadership there the consultants there are many in our race\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA and we'll show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nIs so many will myself included um but I I think we're talking about the senior leadership of an already here and um\nAgain when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner of if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate that ah when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun\nThey're almost institutionally have to be against it because of the terminology in the political position of the terms gun control\nDo you think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times but\nYou know what I mean about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big ... the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties left the place that an array that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics that's galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising\nThat's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides do it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues in America everybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more\nDistinctly in the firearm debate than others when we've been put on that side Scott well I just want to sides\nI wanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a\nUm the gun lobby is such that ah that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm a there is another outlet in many states and that's about initiative Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive a similar measure came close to getting out on the ballots we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nLet me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about state gun legislation in Missouri for the person who was working for a democratic state reps office this is what she left in our inbox\nThis is Emily uh Laughlin calling from Missouri state representative tracing the curies office\nIn two thousand sixteen Missouri has house they'll six fifty six eliminating all permanent requirements for concealing Kerry and the state of Missouri leaving a loophole that allows domestic abusers to possess firearms since two thousand sixteen there's been a bipartisan effort to close that loophole\nLeadership and the Missouri legislator will not news that spell or make it a priority to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers instead during the past session we spend our committee time focusing on bills that expand gun rights like has done Nineteen thirty six known as the guns everywhere bell that little lemonade almost all of the state's gun free zones thanks\nFor your dating on money", "show_name": "1A
