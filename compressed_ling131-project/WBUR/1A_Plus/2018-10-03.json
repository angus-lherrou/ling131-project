get to some of your stories in comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and the freedoms of dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it\nThe thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us were silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board more walking to the program thanks for having me not one Saturday you wrote in the times and accounts of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nUnremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\nYou know for years and my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent on my own experience can\nYou share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had and an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time on and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm often to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly and you know I think ... family is probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I thought at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but you know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so\nYou really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nNow last week professor Conan A democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nAnd they hit the camp this is the laughter ... laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun\nCan you explain for us from a neurological perspective why it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus ... and what it does\n[laughter] um they hit the campus as a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise] doctor for it and her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's going to die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away\nYou when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes\nOr sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood where the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is yeah brain operate\nIt kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie you know you were walking through a haunted house you'll forget all the decor but the thing that leaked out at you the kind of forced your adrenalin to rise dots wouldn't codes that that's a great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment she's mia Lauren important Lawrence Taylor these moments than coach so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through those or ten you\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm Talking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or us a community support group or a ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful\nWhat we do in our empowerment self defense classes are is\nHelp people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but I'm a professor Conan will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of so magic um release of that and so mad at basically means so much is bodies so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting\nAnd um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body you're not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nLeads to a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed\nMy story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin my career again the cascade of consequences for each woman like me goes on for decades says\nShe emailed I'm Seventy two I told my best friend about her employees who sexually harassed me she asked me to show him my breasts while he's stroked himself asked disgusting questions you did not tell in my day my friend she left my friend\nThat's here and now tomorrow at noon on

are you right now tomorrow's conversation deals with the long history of anger expressed by women in America and what it's meant for the country\nWhat's your story has there been times when you chose not to get mad or maybe you grew up being told never to lose your cool leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you have like ... or if you feel more empowered to let folks know exactly how you feel\nWith differences that made tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a can also use or app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file will talk about women and this and other moments of anger tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorist and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came in to us\nVirginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to knowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why\nIt doesn't matter that we were victims\nWhen we are raped we feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves let alone to anyone else\nIf it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so it shaped\nLive thanks very much for sharing your story with the market loved to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes\nAfter that incident like that after an attack like that\nWow and it's powerful um you know [laughter]\nSo I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or reality shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive\nOn and of huge part of the reason I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore at that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that\nI'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel freer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that ah I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really\nWatching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLark I just wanted to um that speak to what this\nWhat lives shared about her experience there are very honorable powerful reasons not to tell\nI Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job\nUm but they are all very real\nAt at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape at them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and she gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others\nAnd I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward pat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist begin molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some worked I could do for him if you check patients in this\nMovie theaters you taught me what a glory hole was he had a friend of his implant an IUD in me this went on for almost two years\nMore and let me speak with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House advisor Kellyanne Conway who spoke to this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rate that\nI ... I don't expect to judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or or any body to me how responsible for that responsible for their own kind that\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN lord what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a side of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before but she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get is drunk as you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently for male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because I'm\nOne of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assaults um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there is even more stigma in terms of being able to come out\nUm and um be heard um so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel and they identify with Dr Ford or did they feel like their experiences are being neglected um I think if more men um\nWho were able to and felt comfortable speaking out that actually it'd be really helpful to move the conversation you mentioned earlier about a men's involvement and I think people have mentioned hearing from ...
