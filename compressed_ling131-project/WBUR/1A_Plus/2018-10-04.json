Brittany Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book elegant rage also here in the studio with me Rebecca Traister writer at large for New York magazine and author of good in mad\nPetra emailed to say I am so tired of people equating my anger with the insanity\nFriends laugh at my posted insinuate that I've lost it and you know what I have I have lost my inability to be quiet in the face of gross injustice\nAnd Joan emailed us I'm sixty five and I was in college with the first feminist resurgence is the world the usa ready for women's anger that's like asking African Americans when will the world be ready for their anger the answer never power doesn't seed without a fight don't even ask the question the question itself\nIs demanding and peg in Traverse City emailed this on a conservative woman that is angry that someone can be assumed guilty based on unproven allegations I'm angry at the assumption that all American women are anti cabinet pro choice liberal and progressive I'm a proud American woman who's also conservative pro life pro Cavanaugh\nI Am an American woman to\nNow Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme and how the story fits into the moment [noise]\nA shore so part of what happens is that women are told on as many of your listeners say that to be angry it to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life\nBecause I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman thought and be a kind of authenticity and she helped me to realize\nThat my anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job or showing up offering quality lectures are material\nOr material but then it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is ... knowledge that we have the right to outrage and so reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way make the irrational or makes our claim illegitimate\nAnd when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means that we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see 'em and more women need to give themselves permission to do that\nI'd given myself permission to do that on and in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize or\nTo change this very scary a trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about or we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst worth being able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room\nIn the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have written onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks\nSerena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresh my memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her\nAh yes I I think that what we saw in response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I are have been talking about it\nWas interesting because there are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she\nShe was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe and so in that moment\n... says if the responses of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um it and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics in the moment in history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict\nUm what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it as\nUm athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political life\nSo there were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova his response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said Martina speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards\nBut Serino was wrong her encore behavior wasn't appropriate paraphrasing just because men region umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right in a champion Serena should not emulated\nRight I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried police arenas conduct I'm as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am livid but Martina Navratilova reminded me\nThat up until this moment most white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters um do when I watch tennis with my friends who are African American and us fans we often talk about watching the matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women\nWho are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about washing the way in which Ramos treated Serena\nWas that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accused her of cheating but this came out on the heels of reports that members of the USDA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated indignity\nAnd then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever see that has a referee who accuses her heating and she's one more grand plan that any woman other than Margaret Court and any woman in the open air\nJust make\nRadio Boston weekdays at three and

premiering October sixteenth on PBS\nMore at Sloan dot org\nEntourage were like sitting in for Joshua jobs when we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America\nI'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the cut author of good in mad Bernie Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book\nRage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton into twenty sixteen campaign and I don't want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton\nHas a history of being very careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America\nAnd in fact it was news in the two thousand ... campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle\nBut people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply how angry [noise] the tone of the campaign became [noise]\nNot her\nFault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became\nI'm ... I'm only does this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's watching here in the studio with me out on strike you know she was off as she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting\nOn it I mean I think it was um\nIt was ridiculous that this woman was called inauthentic while being held to the standard\nOf careful control in her voice and her facial of parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean\nThe two candidates um that were her primary opponents for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound podium Z\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card ride there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton\nBoth Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex ... a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some cat color on the street smile more\nUm she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her\nAnd how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but then she was thinking no no no that's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad\nIt's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about\nHow much energy women expand\nModulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expressions\nI Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last\n... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger goes because this is a moment in America and what's to be realistic moments had a way of feeding they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nThe cameras and all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britain Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many wanting listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is Sarah I'm from Cincinnati when I let my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it\nIt really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable men don't have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with what's going to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however I Am so angry so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger\nFeel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that's what when they have to do we have to take that anger hold onto it and that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a scene there are transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industries taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nRunning for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on my determination to be a voice for all and the focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation of Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect um\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any pollster\nOr political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a tidal wave in twenty Eighteen one way or the other [noise]\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by\nThe Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the first black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state of the ... practically campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of\nA progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south\nAnd so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have that channeling our anger\nOn for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment\nUm but to your earlier point about whether or not our anger can be sustained\nUm I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country though it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project uh since uh depending on how you count eight seed thirty one or Eighteen forty eight\nSo we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know\nI'm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think the women see that um our power in our ability to frame issues in ways that include the most American and take care of the most marginalized American um I", "year": "2018",
