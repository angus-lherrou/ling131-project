{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBUR", "content": "[noise]\n\nLooking as they have the [noise]\nFrom one World Trade center in Manhattan [noise] this is the New Yorker radio our production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker I'm\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick a man named Jerry Robinson made a killing in the radio business invested in satellite radio when it was just beginning\nTo be a kind of commercial possibility he got rich and he retired early so how did he fall for a business proposition that seemed absolutely crazy to everyone around him and left his family\nRoom ... or so I think just as we ... I Would be your ... Jerry was news was go after ...\nDirector germs\nMaria kind of covert who's something of an expert in the art at the con will help explain\nThere's something that motivates all of us and a con artist is able to identify what it is that we're missing what it is that we most want to give it to us and you'll find yourself unable to resolve that later in the hour going\nTo start by taking a look at the mid term elections which are just a month away is if the Republicans didn't have enough to contend with including allegations against Brett Kavanaugh that have made this the ugliest Supreme\nThey have a president who tends to undercut them on the economy most Republicans want to stick with the positive numbers they have they can boast about strong employment and economic growth but Donald Trump in case you hadn't noticed is not most Republicans Trump feels that terrorists in trade wars are a winning issue with his base and he\nDoesn't really care what economists think either even economists in his cabinet he's just imposed another enormous round of tariffs on China\nAnd China has predictably retaliated staff writer John Cassidy has been looking at the administration's trade policies and how they're playing out during the mid term election campaign he spoke with Sheila called had car reports for us on business and labor\nWe're in this increasingly hostile period right now in terms of the rhetoric coming out of the Trump Administration around foreign trade and last week uh terrorists on two hundred billion dollars worth of goods from China went into effect and China responded by adding sixty billion dollars worth of tariffs on us products\nAnd this comes after major tensions between the U.S and Mexico Europe and Canada over trade\nHow politically risky are these tariffs to Donald Trump as we head into the midterms\nWell I certainly think a lot of people in the Republican side would have wished you'd waited until after the midterms just because they're already in bad shape and even though as I think we'll discuss the trade politics who tried to quite complicated\nIt it it basically as a diversion from the good economic news which you know the sort of Paul Ryan's and Mitch McConnell's or the world would rather be talking about a strong economy low unemployment rate\nHigh rates of economic growth et cetera instead of that the big economic news is you know Trump slapping tariffs on Chinese Chinese retaliating gonna hurt consumers and I'm going to hurt Republicans in a few individual states do probably\nSo obviously these terrorists are going to translate to higher prices and to to higher production costs um how quickly to those effect start to be felt\nWhile I mean the the effects of the previous round already being felt ... one of the examples he's washing machines like puts out of some washing machines and price of washing machines in front of gone up ten Fifteen Percent and sales have gone down or we see these things have to come around the world so it takes a dozen is not immediate but the two hundred billion that have been slapped on last week\nYou know that's probably going to go into effect over the next month also on what's new about these tariffs as\nThe two hundred billion or on a very wide range of good six thousand and lots of sort of consumer goods desktop computers lighting fixtures furniture some forms of clothing et cetera so that's really gonna start heading to the consumer rather than just businesses and ...\nHow is this likely to help Trump I mean the timing of this and uh the way he keeps bringing it up over the jets he thinks this is going to help sell his message to certain groups of people say wait what's his rationale throw out\nAgain I think I have to go back to the fact that basic facts about the American economy as these huge\nTwenty trillion dollars of GDP is just an immensely complicated machine with three hundred million people thousands and thousands different industries hundreds of thousands of phones et cetera\nSo if you slept with a bunch of tired of some things and there's ... different sectors different industries even within states get hit differently now Trump's big argument on the big political argument for him as always being these defending the sort of industrial Midwest the rust belt\nAnd you can see that the basic policies off pretty popular though you can see that from the reaction for example of shuttered brown democratic senator who's up for re election in Ohio in a close race and he is supported Trump steel and aluminum Turner's and he's also urged Trump to stay tough in talks with China are not given\nSo clearly drums policies play some places like playing the rust belt they playing big sort of centers of steel but at the same time they don't play it elsewhere just across the border in Missouri for example Claire McCaskill is attacking Trump because he's um import tariffs on steel and aluminum\nA hurting local factories would use those goods as raw materials as a nail factory which is about to close are responding to close and she's blaming the terrorists so they sort of cuts you know quite fine levels ... within different states\nUm you can see other states to where the Republicans are actually on defensive about trade and the Democrats are the ones who are talking I mentioned Missouri is also a Tennessee and North Dakota\nI was just going to ask you a bit about how the terrorists are playing out in the Tennessee Senate race that the Democratic nominee Phil Bredesen is a former governor popular in this state uh but is it unusual that the Tennessee race would be so close\nIt is yeah I mean Trump won the state I think by twenty five or twenty six points in two thousand six day and so you would think this would be a a the Republicans have ... here [noise] um and it's obviously Bob Corker who's retiring\nIt's much much closer than the Republicans were like British son is not in the late Marsha Blackburn a Republican Congress much trying to replace a still holds a narrow lead in all the polls but it looks like we're talking three or four points and I sort of within the margin of error\nAnd one of the reasons is hitting the Republicans held on trade pointing out for example Chattanooga, Tennessee is big BMW factory\nThey all use imported steel and imported go to a child being hit by terrorists so you know that's a typical so the Southern Republican state where you think Trump policies will be popular but in this case they seem to be playing against him\nAnd how is his opponent handling the trade issue then\nWell you see this in Tennessee I'm In North Dakota it's very awkward for\n... is it sort of part of the some of these public and voters don't like the trade policies but Trump is still very popular in these states if you look at his approval ratings much higher than than nationally so they don't want to distance themselves from Trump both because he's popular on because if they do distance themselves from me maybe all started sucking them on Twitter\nThey need to support so they're generally what you're seeing is there um\nExpressing concerns about the impact of some of these terrorists but they're not coming out straightforwardly and saying this is a mistake you know we need to end this trade while they're trying to struggle and that's why it's a good issue for the for the Democrats because they've got these candidates pinned\nThe account distance themselves from Trump but they don't want to defend Trump's some popular policies\nSo in North Dakota the Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp I just ran an ad about how terrorists are hurting soybean farmers you know let's take a listen to that\nChina is canceling their contracts to buy soybeans North Dakota is losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business from Boeing us Kevin Cramer why he supports the drain warn you criticizes farmers but I hear all kinds of hysteria\nThere's potential short term pain we don't have a very high pain threshold and the United states of America\nMr Kramer that trade war is costing my family a lot of money man you don't seem to care from\nThe administration announced at twelve billion dollar aid package for farmers the sort of farmer bailout package to help them cope with the terrorists do you think that's going to be enough to help counteract this argument about how he's inflicting pain on on farmers\nBut I think it certainly helped us to some point I mean I Love the Republicans are always in favor of socialism for farmers in our customers capitalism for everybody else such there's not going to find but um\n[noise] I mean\nIf you're just sort of going on a sort of a heart basis listening to the box pops into being done the\nPharmacy and to be saying yes they they welcome the relief from this bailout but they'd much rather to be selling it to be selling their goods properly and they don't want to they tried to go on forever now than do so and then when you say to them well is it bad enough that you're going to vote against Donald Trump of the Democrats\nBut we were broke\nSomehow my dad had lost all his money and kept it from us we didn't even have enough to pay his hospital\nThis wasn't the way it was supposed to end\n[noise] live virus prime star review on them\nAnd I was a kid I wasn't that close to my dad he was busy running on radio network called the trans star star with exciting it was one of the first to use satellite technology for radio news you have not innovation made my dad very rich ... [noise] we lived in a giant\nHouse the kind that had multiple wings I remember cars slowing down to gawk at our Tudor style mansion\nWe were pretty big laser disc family than maybe just being a laser disc family alone just like ah makes me feel the wealth of growing up\nThat's my brother Patrick along with the rest of the family we were members of a country club took etiquette classes for kids we dressed up in nice clothes when we flew first class it was important to my dad that we presented as the wealthy family we were\nYou know that's what he was raised in kind of like east coast real classic wash these sort of stuff you know Kennedys or bushes\nAbove right [noise]\nOh they'll start yelling out a little bit of [noise] this is how I like to remember my dad\nThis is a video from Nineteen eighty nine my dad's onstage with friends band flash Cadillac singing an Elvis song because it's the eighties he's wearing a white suit with an open collared shirt and she's kind of pulling it off\nOnstage my dad's seems larger than life and in some ways he was [noise]\nWhen I was growing up he'd always talk about his swim records at Dartmouth College\nIn tell this story about the time he turned down an invitation to hang out with Paul McCartney my step mom Vivian fell in love with that version of Terry Robin and I saw your father across the room and we kind of caught each other's I\nThey met at a party a few years after my\nWent up and saying with the band which was really cool that led to a date and it was the worst first guest ever I mean we mess [laughter]\n\nIt was a disaster Vivian started dating my dad when he had already retired from radio he was about fifty when he stopped working and started spending time in Florida where he met a boat builders named Dan Johnson\nSays to the industrial word or this is the choir lack then then would be able to vote for anyone who asked\nYou know one of my employees was asked me earlier she said well then you should you knew everybody and the courage to ... car drove you knew the trolley cars drill and not that I dealt with them but I I Will vote for everybody right\nI wanted to talk to Dan because his name was on some documents I found on my dad's laptop turns out that my dad and Dan once had a business relationship with that guy from the tapes Jim Stuckey\nWill there's an interesting thing\nDance as Jim had a business proposal for them to set up a shipyard in Saudi Arabia\nShook not a chance in hell I told her I said I think this goes asleep ... con artist I wouldn't even give 'em a time of day but Terry\nWas let's go after ... ... you know your dad was\nHe he was a risk taker you I mean he [noise]\nYou know are are just really curious how long he's still at a relationship with this guy for the dragged on for a long time up until he died\nWhile [noise]\nIs Ross\nShocking rest so it it was two thousand or Ninety nine\nI remember which are twelve years of\nHe was still involved with a jar\nWeren't what are your what you want what you've been involved in what was it you\nKnow very confusing it's really hard to figure out [noise]\nIt is absolutely insane\nUs that has been involved in these supposedly we're going to get the ten million out through a bank in New York City bank chase me of a Credit Suisse bank commissioner of buildings remember all the president's\nDay I'm writing a slow down on\nThe calls all have details like that the central bank the U.S fed the governor the doctor the Germans sometimes even the family a Ferdinand Marcos this is these are kind of all photos\nThat um were included that Jim since my dad is kind of like proof of that I found this binder full of documents and photos Jim had shared with my dad\nAnd I was hoping it was clear some things off over well with that sort of helped me interpreted I reached out to a New Yorker writer Maria ... so we started looking at this binder\nThat had all these photos of gold bars cardboard box is filled with cash\nIn weather beaten metal box stamped Federal Reserve John it's completely overwhelming and\nAnd it's totally random and Jim claimed he knew where to find this stuff gets which was hidden in different parts of the Philippines\nIf my dad put up the cash than Jim acting as a sort of middle man\nWould be able to help bring the treasures out of hiding and Jim and my dad would get millions in the process that's just it's so sad to me to think that he could get all of this information and be like well yeah you know what it's it's human\nLike it's really really hard to dissuade people who actually want to believe in it seems like your dad really wanted something to do with his life\nAnd con artist ... meaning they give you purpose they tell you a story that makes sense of your life again because they're very very good at figuring out you know what are you missing and what do you want to believe that\nYou know it it's more than just the money to me is the fact that I've gone from being one of the most respected business people among community with them on my credibility among competency\nSome um learn some money whatever but it's it's on the head in\nA large sum of money will be using you know everybody will want to know\nBecause to me I mean I I've been there before you know and I started the radio on it revolutionize radio business and and ah [noise]\nMade made some money you know all of a sudden and all she walks around conventions and I was a genius you know so yeah I mean all along or a reasonable amount of money would we establish\nFrom the video as well [noise] ... you know just all my life in a valley\n\nSo actually um one personality type that's really good for con artist\nUm is the type of person who your dad seems to have been um someone who's very entrepreneurial someone who is open to risks who's open to new business ventures because\nThe smarter you think you are the less susceptible you think you are and so you you kind of think you can navigate in murkier terrain and you become overconfident and then you make poor decisions\nAnd that was my dad impulsive\n[noise] I don't think he did any research\nIt didn't take me long to learn that in Nineteen eighty nine Jim was charged with defrauding Maryland national bank of two and a half million dollars he pled out on one count and was sentenced to a halfway house [noise]\nThe Treasury Department also has a warning on their website about a Philippine space con involving fraudulent bonds and treasury certificate but some similar to what Jim was working on\nAnd yet\nMy dad kept sending him more and more money [noise]\nYou know dream that our son chew over a million dollars [noise]\n... very interesting sort of cash to you [noise]\nArthur you're from or for her so much of the\nWorld's oil go on to you and some of those going on those people are ... by ... [noise]\nI don't see how your for your ... and I'm not sure if I'm always celebrated every\nFall where where's the one point two percent going through\nMy dad never talked about money with me and my brother here I was learning\nMore about him from these cassettes than anything he ever said to me in person oh\n[noise] oh\nThank you very much I'll look forward stranger okay me too okay I have a good day right you're right [noise]\nI mean to number one don't go Maria ...\nAnd don't don't underestimate old men no seriously these there's sometimes the most vicious they are people who have been con artist their entire life and if you think they have end of life regrets think again I mean I don't think Jim is going to assault but someone else might\nI'm not sure if Jim conned my family it's possible he really did believe the treasures for real or maybe there's some other explanation but Maria thinks that if there's even a potential that Jim as a con artist is reason enough not to meet him\nAnd because Jim is old he's going to use that against you should look at me like I'm a poor man and you'll see him and he's going to actually look much more pathetic to you and he looks to anyone else he's going to make sure that you know he's going to arrive with a catheter I'm and she ... seriously looking just really\nJust you know he's doing everything he can for you\nUm and he's going to talk to you and he's going to seem nice and you're going to say oh like\nYou know maybe he's not such a bad guy so\nYou don't think I should meet him no [laughter]\nI don't think I mean I Know I don't I think that once that happens and they reach could of the distance between the two of you that's the moment the objectivity stops that's why it's always very easy to tell when other people have been conned but the people in the ... I Can't tell and we judge them for it\n[noise] of course I agree laws here\nHere's\nThe deal yeah now I Know you're a miserable I I still don't think\n\nThat's Maria ... speaking with Maggie Robinson cat [noise] or story the long distance con continues next week when maybe not surprisingly Maggie chose to ignore her expertise\nI worry about\nThat so we're we're about to get on the plane that went nowhere to go to Jim\nStill to come today [noise]\n\nOh my God it's Jones yet whatever it is you want to be in life so what other people sort of\n[noise] sticker [noise]\nOther\nYour car radio hour is supported by the wall Street Journal\nGlobal markets politics tax and the arts the wall Street Journal read ambitious lay membership options and more information at W.
