on the rights of the urban poor\nCan you describe what goes is like like what what what I see if I went there mhm\nSo I guess it depends on which legal she live\nAnd right and I think that maybe this is universal where the where cities up once and like you can be in the same physical space but because of your identity or your social location you experience it completely different so for instance the legal said I experience is different from the legal that my daughter as many\nExperiences so you're driving down the fed mainland bridge and look to your right are you left as the case may be and you can see some of the fishing vessels that have\nNow been termed slums along the side of the bridge and you can leave the land feeling that's being done on the other side where the reclaiming the

lines\nAnd that ... get only deep and over the past forty or fifty years and like us banks in part to an explosion and population growth now the changing economy\nClass has become much more than he meant it um class mobility is not as\nClear cut doors possible as it used to be and my grandfather's generation it was it was easy to send one or two children to school and have them access jobs and then have them than their siblings or their cousins to school and slowly you sort of lift the whole family\nOut of poverty in one or two generations rides and that's no longer possible\nBullets

even though nothing looks like that I mean by definition the whole of legal through the slum right let's be honest if we take\nThe technical definition of lack of\nSanitation services lack of infrastructure who city is a slum\nBut I'm more and more you hear agencies of government officials talked about ultra modern projects and what they really mean is stuff that's like steel and concrete than glass and mirrors and looked like the New York's skyline type is septic so you can use this sort of rhetoric to\nPush out poor populations or at least that's what the hope will happen but the truth is like in the end for people to just disappear\nRight so if you push them further and further away from wherever it is that you want to make into a shiny suburb or you will ... [noise] where do you think they're going to go [noise]\nThe conditions that cause us to to find such an neighborhoods slumps can be effective you improved but not without recognizing humanity and the agency of the people living in them\nAnd LeVar sweat public goods are rarely publicly available slum dwellers are often at the forefront of innovating solution I should've been disconnected from the grid for months because the company couldn't figure out how to collective one settlements designed a system that collects device German sentences and goes to everyone\nAnother settlement created a reform program that has no go bad boys that security you know every chick and every hideouts so now troublemakers more likely to get caught in a report released and few of us end up and gave him a criminal activity\nSums are an imperfect housing solution but they also prime examples of innovation adaptability and resilience after Sunday's on and the hot of every functional city we have our own identity our own risen\nAnd as anyone in Las Vegas and tell your politicians are very often the source of the city's character without its for Lagos would not be known for its music guards and less energy or even the fact that you can buy an eyesore drink or a puppy through your car window [noise]\nShe spent a time in some of these neighborhoods that that I guess are defined as slums or I mean what what's your experience for what were they like for you\nI mean I remember the first time I went into\nOne from that's literally built on like an island of garbage\nHuh that's sort of it's packed really tightened the and then it's layered sodas and indeed was sort of some sort of carpeting or signed or something but then if you go into the police and you see the people\nWho live here and they have all kinds of ... they're making marginal profits on a daily basis but enough to pay their rent to send their kids to school to scale up their businesses where that's possible and to save\nAnd you realize from interacting with the people in particular that is not that much\nThat is so significantly different about them and there are people who have economic wherewithal to live elsewhere who just don't want to because they're the quality of life\nThat comes from living in such close proximity to your friends and your family and your colleagues in your church members of your the people you go to more squeeze there's a sense of community that is so rich that is almost impossible to get in more formal neighborhoods in legal ...\nWith the ... gallery ... support for the\nTide radio our comes from the N E E Casey foundation developing solutions to support strong families and communities to help ensure a brighter future for America's children more information is available at a E.

helping NPR advanced journalistic excellence in the digital age\nIt's the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and on the show today\nIdeas about cities and how we can build more humane ones and just before the break we were hearing from architect the shock sugar party in Michigan says designed could be part of the solution but largely depends on how we use technology\nTechnology was a big part of the problem in the twentieth century ... when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention and we recreated our landscape around in the twenty first century [noise]\nTechnology can be part of the solution is it bends\nTo the needs of the world and so what do I mean by that take the economist vehicle I don't think the economist vehicle is exciting because it's a driverless car\nI think what's exciting about the autonomous vehicle is the promise that we have these small urban vehicles that could safely coal mingle with pedestrians and bicycle\nThat would enable us to design Jew main streets again streets without Herb's maybe streets like wouldn't walkways on fire island [noise]\nOr maybe we can design streets with the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melting snow helps you with your fitness when you walk\n[noise] remember those big ladder fire trucks what if we could replace them and all the asphalt that comes with them with drones and robots to rescue people from burning buildings and if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed you know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity\n\nBut now it like you to really a match and with me [noise] imagine if we could design the Hubbard craft wheelchair [noise] write an invention that would\nNot only allow equal access but would enable us to build\nThe Italian hill town of\nThe twenty first century [noise] I think you'd be amazed to know that is just a few of these inventions responsive\nTo human need\nWould completely transformed the way we can build our city [noise]\n\nForm cities into into these more humane places like with the help of technology or whatever I mean there will still be\nSome level of inhumanity and I'm right in right not is it possible to have no social discord at all\nYou know part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technologists and the room and technology can be wonderful people but they can also be a bit a historical and what I was hoping to convey to a room full of technologists is we need them to invent stuff\nThat helps us bill more humane cities right firefighting drones and the and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and so forth so we can look at all those codes and standards that we have to build with\nAnd change them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first and twenty second century because technology is allowed us to change those standards [noise]\nUm but that's not the goal the goal is the standards of changing so we can designs infrastructure so we create some more social friction cities\nAt their best our engines social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring\nAnd you saw what was happening in ... where we saw what it was happening in Tunisia it's because cities tend to be the platform for social change in nation\nAnd social friction requires a kind of lay in my book I call it an infrastructure of opportunity this idea that you're\nBuilding public spaces subway systems\nThe farmer's markets in places where people are from different walks of life\nMeat eyeball to eyeball the social fiction is fundamentally what advances civilization and I think that's really the heart of\nThe architect of the ... he's a professor at Columbia in his latest book is called a country of cities\nManifesto for urban America you can see his soul talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today buildings humane cities ideas about many of the challenges that cities now face\nWhen your mayor for eight years you get a chance to meet people from all over\nRichard Barry he was the mayor of Albuquerque New Mexico from two thousand nine to two thousand Seventeen\nAnd you'll meet people at the grocery store you'll meet people on the street you start having conversations you'll do deep dives in your community and you you start becoming keenly aware that as much as you think you understand you just haven't walked a mile\nNew shoes during Richard's time as mayor Albuquerque sun spike in its homeless population and lots more people panhandling and the streets and so it Richard Want it to come up with a more humane approach for how to deal with it\nSo I saw a gentleman on a dry fifteenth twenty Fifteen I Believe was the day I was on my way back to city hall from a lunch meeting and he was holding a sign that said he wants a job\nAnd listen I'm a student and I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff\nAnd I said listen I saw gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different why don't we make government less complicated rather than more complicated why don't we take this man in his word\nAnd I grew up in ... in Nebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people putting my grandparents and my parents were hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning and accomplish something that's been engrained in me since I was a child\nAnd so we just wanted to take that and present an opportunity\nTo worry about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up to the dignity of work\nYou're more from Richard bury 'em that Ted stage\nRecall if there's a better one because\nI Believe there's a better way to get the money you need an panhandling on the corner I Believe there is a better way to help your brothers and sisters in need than handing a\nFew dollars out the car window we know there's dignity and work we also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that there are community is willing to invest in them first\nAnd because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate it always feels good to have a couple of dollars to someone that is a need\nBut if you talk to panhandlers and many of them will tell you that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body that go towards feeding ...\nIs the Albuquerque the beautiful place where a mile high Sandia Mountains on the east the Rio Grande runs through the center of our city where there's always something to do always read the whole litter the pickup\nSo if you're going to have an initiative like this in your city you have to ask yourself to questions first one is is there anything left to do in your city then if the answer is no would you please give me your mayors phone number\nThe second question you have to ask is this are you are solutions to panhandling working if you're taking the peanuts have approach ominous ingest there solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting\nTo the root of the problem in your city so if you have something to do you need people that need something to do the good news is is not that complicated [noise]\nSo so would you do we took an old van from our motor pool a dodge van but some tires on it I mean sure the brakes worked and uh then we reached out to St Martin's hope works in Albuquerque\nAnd we ask for their health or a nonprofit that works with the homeless and they do a lot of great things from feeding programs to housing programs to employment programs\nWe took a fifty thousand dollars we created a pilot program and we hired them to be the facilitators to do the paperwork to pay the individuals to work for the day\nTo do all of the functional things that needed to be done to run the program\nBut more importantly we had this notion that if you live somebody up for the day they are naturally going to feel better about themselves about their circumstances somebody believed in them today and they may have an opportunity and may be inclined to try to reach out for some of the services that maybe they hadn't reached out for before so we wanted to make those available\nAnd the seven thousand jobs that have been created day jobs or through the better way program we've been able to impact a almost a sixteen or Seventeen hundred people in those three hundred and sixty five of them have actually reached out for mental health services substance abuse services the things that they need to do to make improvements in their lives and so", "year": "2018",
