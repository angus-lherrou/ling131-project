L. dot edu [noise]\nSome WVU are Boston and NPR I'm making a chocolate party and this is on point ten years after the two thousand the financial crisis it's hard now to remember that as financial institutions failed or were on the brink there were scenes in American cities akin to what you'd expect to see during a bank run in a developing country\nThere are people who need money to pay their bills I mean there's one guy that's been here for eleven thirty last night I been here since five thirty this morning\nWe'll that was July two thousand eight and the voices of people waiting in line outside of IndyMac uh thirty two billion dollar California bank taken over by the FDIC the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had taken over just three banks in two thousand seven\nBut by two thousand ten that number had jumped to more than three hundred twenty banks that held more than six hundred and forty billion dollars in assets that may be FDIC\nOne of the most influential agencies in the government's recovery effort alongside the Federal Reserve and the U.S treasury the woman running the FDIC at the time she will bear the Kansas Republican was appointed to the post in June two thousand six by President George W. Bush she served as FDIC chief for five years until two thousand eleven\nWill a decade after the financial crisis what does she live bears the now the FDIC was created in Nineteen thirty three to restore public confidence in the nation's financial system in two thousand Eighteen is the system deserving of that trust\nThis hour on point Sheila bear bailouts and the future of the American financial system and she joins us now from Washington Welcome to on point thank you thank you for having me\nWell you know I Know a from reading about your career that you first started paying attention to subprime mortgages back in two thousand one and two thousand two\nBut I but I see here that it was in two thousand was six as soon as you came on board at FDIC did you actually asked uh your colleagues to buy a database of subprime loans from a company called lone performance [laughter] what'd\nYou say yes I'd been in academia for several years and had not been really working in the mortgage area and a bit retained an interest in it and when I got back\nThe staff or as the FDIC were were already on top of this they're worried about it but we couldn't really see what was going on because the these mortgages are being secured ties all of our reporting systems were geared towards\nAssets aid in this case loans are actually on the banks books and in these for mostly we're not even being originated by banks are the big banks were providing some support to the non bank originator is here we're doing this and helping them package them insecurities\nAnd sell them off so this was data that showed those original mortgages then ...\nIt it shows the underlying mortgages ... trust and\nAnd so when you took a look and when your colleagues at FDA if he took a look I mean what did you see where are you\nConcerned yes we were [laughter] stoppage [laughter] I couldn't believe what I saw oh my gosh so\nAs you noted in your introductory remarks are my history of this goes back to the early ... thousands where we're seeing this kind of abuses of lending but it was really ... it was a marginal you know players in the mortgage industry that we're doing it and they were targeting\nSenator Jeff flake is in Boston you know so Massachusetts secret courts radio Boston\nHeaded ten do review our supporters include artist humanities greatest party on on October Thirteen celebrating creative teams if you expanded epicenters grand opening more greatest party on earth dot com ... ethics museum presenting ... of the Forbidden City exquisitely treasures made for the most\nPowerful women of imperial China open now\nP. E. N. dot org and Welsh and Ford\nPrivate trustees in family office services is Eighteen thirty Welsh Forbes dot com\nThis is on point I'm making a talk of already we're talking today with Sheila ... she was the head of the FDIC from two thousand six to two thousand eleven\nAnd we're talking about the role that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation played in a the financial crisis and getting the nation out of it and what she ... now when she looks across the financial system or whether she sees a healthy system or not and she lived there joins us from Washington today\nA Sheila there's a story that you tell in your two thousand twelve book I think bull by the horns if that's the story that the very beginning of the book and it's just\nIt's so telling us how hoping you could read if you could share it once again with us and it's it's a story about um how you in two thousand eight in October two thousand eight you attend is very key meeting at the treasury with Hank Paulson\nAnd I believe what a seven of the top CEOs of the biggest financial institutions in America\nRight yeah well that was um [noise] that was quite\nA quite a meeting it was false and they called it I was their members heirs have gotten there was there the head of the other banking regulators or were there and um the purpose\nOf the beating was basically for us to tell the banks that uh we were going to take some interventions and that we wanted them all to participate there is this the there was a you know the ... the court center piece of it was the tarp capital investment yet are going to\nPut under the veins of dollars into a new capital into these banks or the FBI she was gonna start within limits and for the we're going to start a year and she uh the debt that they needed to issue to roll expiring debt we had because the markets were seized up and they were having hard time refinancing their own debt\nAnd then the fed had trillions of dollars of learning disabilities that they they put into place and so it was ... it was basically to explain those new programs and is\nThat they had to take the ... well yeah you know and as I say that I think a lot of that\nWas a was designed to cover up the problems the weaker banks like city I think most of them at all but most of them probably could've bumble through but show we didn't want to test that and ah and also there was a lot of fear that if you just singled out certain banks for\nAssistance you are going to make them look bad and you know exacerbate their problems right so the that was the reasoning\nWhy I kind of just read a paragraph from from from the book because it's so telling about\nI think that the the state of the financial system that maybe ... many Americans just weren't aware of before two thousand eight you say again this is a meeting of Monday October thirteenth he doesn't eat you say nine men student milling around in the room men I should know right nine men\nParental really ... really some and thereby treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you're right I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\n[laughter] yeah that's right [laughter] well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there was even balance of power and and I still think we suffer from it\nThat uh you know who works for ... does does it ever worked for the banks are you know or did just that the banks the banks and the safety net the get FDIC Deposit Insurance and fed access and all that\nDo they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fulfill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these so government supports like Deposit Insurance can can incentivize a risk taking and too big to fail\nJust really doubles down on that so yeah I I did not I didn't want there to many question about the balance of power\nAnd it was a turning it wasn't you know and I certainly didn't want look up look like I was the weak link so uh you know I think that some of them told me they're afraid of me I don't know if there that's a joke\n[laughter] I Can't I Can't\nBe little directed times I Will be the first to admit that but I I Do think that it was important for the government to be the person in charge and well I mean I just\nI I'm I Am so the numbers of looking at the ... the sentence written on the piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me\nNine trillion dollars and edit Seventy percent of the U.S financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and two interconnected to feel that we had well\nIt it it is and whether we fix said I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric\nAnd Tim Geithner obviously you know I've had our disagreements in and their policy disagreements but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're going to have another financial system that's going to need government help and so we need\nMore bailout tools and I think that's ...\nSystem we still have that we don't want to save that system that you would like banks go down now oh well we we have something called title to and which we did not have a ... in two thousand eight and yes\nThat allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed\nTo you know put a bag into a resolution process to break it up you know keep his bad assets out impose the losses on the shareholders and the and secured creditors which is where the losses should be and where the losses are also if you go through a traditional bankruptcy\nTo fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the bank you know and and you're bringing new investors new management to and and in return they healthy parts of the bag back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process or ... unique\nThings about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a difficult to you that's a tool we didn't have been to them we have now the regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind them markets that this this is going to be the new paradigm this is the due process not bailouts but accountability\nWills are going to ask you can you know of so many questions to live there because I I I'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as some like crazy anti capitalist has not ... not I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis\nI mean as long as the banks are too big already won a breeder huh well\nUh there are people who have that view and I can understand that view and ah I don't think there's a political will ah in Washington to do that I mean and this is bipartisan unfortunately you see\nLegislation going through now the reduced uh three the largest banks we have reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this bill that just passed\nAnd in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress testing\nRequirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say 'cause I'm a Republican and I thought ... you know Republicans are market oriented a lot of Republicans trying to pressure the fed to reduce capital even more so that's a political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter]\nThat's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else and and my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before\nThey finally happens but yeah I mean if they needed a bailout again I think ... our democracy cannot survive that and if they think\nSedated and again she lived her I said I don't our democracy could not survive another round of bailouts it just you can't look what look what happened you know people who discount the role of the two thousand eight crisis\nAnd and even you know the eight million a homes lost nine million jobs lost\nYou know that that the terrible hit to the public purse\nStill people struggling in lower middle income families um that started with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ... and ... and I think that's a lot of what if he's in the discontent we have right now so to suggest that we're going to bail out together that's going to be the new paradigm that\nWe don't really need to bother regulation trying to prevent crises we just need to be repaired with more taxpayer bailout tools I don't think democracy is going to tolerate that\nWell you know uh so okay that's quite a bracing thing that you said and yet I I've been speaking with you and other people who were very key to the uh in the two thousand two thousand nine period any financial observer most people say we probably will have another crisis knows how to square with our democracy yeah well\nIt's a if it well like I said you're hearing different he's in different people and I'm not I don't know that we're going to have another crisis I I I think we ... what I think we should be doing now that we are towards the end of the cycle\nWe should be preparing for the next downturn and economic cycle if banks have enough capital unstable funding to continue functioning\nWhen the economy turns you know and their credit losses go out that's what happens in a downturn if they have or if they are resilient to continue functioning and continue lending we will have a downturn we will not have a crisis we will not have a deep recession it's all about how we see the financial system is which is why now\nAnd crack a wiccan gallery featuring Julian OBs knew his paintings for instance animated work to do very strict Boston or crack how we can go ... [noise]\nAnd here today not because I see\nAnd terrified Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ... in a historic hearing on Capitol Hill what impact could their testimony have on public opinion and how the Senate handles his nomination entire country is watching how we handle these allegations on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nTomorrow morning at five Ninety point nine W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nDoes his own point I'm making Tucker birdie okay here's a pop quiz for you how many American Soldiers are in Syria today\nThe answer around two thousand and why are they they're well to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week's national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote as long as Iranian troops are outside\nAnd he and proxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran\nSo listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're one eight hundred for two three to five five is eight hundred for two three talk\nWell joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lose it's good to have you\nThank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is ... rent for he is a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me\nAll right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by the we've got a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is is regarding the U.S mission in Syria\n[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the\nPrior to U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in the eastern theory in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded\nSo the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged a Pentagon officials up to and including secretary of defense Mattis that us troops are only fighting ISIS\nHowever they do play a secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country a boat and kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us to withdraw is ah the withdrawal of Iranian forces\nSo that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters that we used\n... so I'm seeing here that James Jeffrey ... uh the state department special representative for Syria a following John ... comments said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission\nAgain until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right there there are counterterrorism authorizations\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers al Qaida and its affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq and so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that\nThe way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to quote it by saying that us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit\nWell Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I may be to use ... raise ... description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region\n[noise] well\nI think people in the thing that the price by the second coming out you can't you learned that we've seen that yet because as you remember a few months ago um ... we're going to be going home very very soon and was actually an expectation that they would be caught on by the end of the year\nAnd most of the regional palate I'm invoking Sherry I checked she Russia Jackie I'm no everyone else in the neighborhood has been expecting he likes to go and they can practically to punish the ... the idea that that actually going to be getting out and gets ... definitely puts them back like\nIn the picture when it comes to negotiate an end to the Syrian more and I think it should be on our Web that she'll go and eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric\nOn ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside of Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be held up to\nWell the very next day on Wednesday of less meat week some lawmakers did question of the U.S is military role in Syria and this expansion of the military objective they question Robert ... assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs\nAnd here you are going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton pressing came to get more specific about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission and fighting ISIS the problem is that national security advisor\nYou've indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws for its forces that to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran\nEspecially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of wrong not actions of ISIS or the defeat of ISIS\n... let me ask you about this because it seems as if what Congress and molten is saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional authorization for that\n[laughter] yeah so he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're\nIn the region with the mission to balance against those forces or restrict those forces freedom maneuver through eastern Syria means that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization\nHas the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that\nI mean I don't think that they don't think any real administration has\nA show in a willingness to get a new authorization to use military force ah I mean that's a question of the Aspen brought up ah during the past airstrikes that have occurred against the Assad regime in response to the chemical weapons attacks some people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from two thousand and one or two of them to\n... know Liz Sly I mean the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said\nWe'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to ... to stability and peace in the middle east in the region\nAnd to that effect you today you just\nWent on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show or the Israelis and it wasn't a missiles like can you tell us a little bit more about that\nWell yes I'm\nAt the United nations um last week the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture\nOf punk off that he's Hitler just shocked like Jim age and with three think like ours on it we seem to cut ... sites that\nWhen his while I was a huge story well manufacturing Mikhail to be which could be used to like when it's Lyle such gate the Lebanese fine ministry invited ambassadors took all the countries that them but you can walk up and then\nUm did you go and visit she's arts people to try to see that they don't contain any child\nSo what we did was we went to actually went to the Gulf Coast but that would keep aren't on state we shouldn't laugh so then they put you back on the buses and we went to a sports club ... and ... and other stuff\nAnd then we went to a warehouse that was kind of and she ended with designed to show us the chance for them it's not in fact storing it in his house in the site to do it was very much child\nFrom the very simple picture which Netanyahu flash chocolate United Nations exactly why the site where anyway and um so it it was very hard to tell you if you were in the ... and ... and he didn't he I mean the trials\nHuh OK so a button [laughter] so but regarding for example um\nIsrael's response to the United states starting to talk about a more permanent or at least in definite presence in Syria certainly they must be supporting this\nOld you are you are all students NPR News station\nMajor funding from point is provided by Geico offering auto insurance

I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks have been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just want to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting are just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we have justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived\nA preferred vote of the president that ... that nominated then I put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true there is also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nAs a nominee for the Supreme Court politics play a role it's always played a role in some sense and also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics and politics and play some role in the court\nAnd people oftentimes do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some ways a political institutions automatically is legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to followers dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were for waiting so patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get this is from almost be through it first of all of the the point of course is the legitimacy of integrity or public\nTrust for the last two perception and if you\nThink about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a adjusted to repeal replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public's eye now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a easily manipulated a populist in modern history\nAnd so through the media and through a lot of other things they are uh giving a perception of what is and what is not but to the last several months Donald Trump in his\nA blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with this don't down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats saying that a lot of law\nI think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of\nLimits on terms now because it is simply a political position\nWell Aaron thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one ... there about from them from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with justices\nWell I think term limits as a wonderful idea that's not that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out the problem is it'll never happen\nBecause it would require is maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress\nOr the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be hurt who's ... who whose people are older\nYou know who's terms or later ... is it going to help the red team of the blue team and they're always be a calculation where of one side's thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing\nAnd neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years um but that's what's going I think that's what we're going to be seen from ... for a long time well\nLet's go to Troy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air Troy\nThank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported taken\nW.

got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation a bear before the break we had heard from college Steve who was former navy special forces are here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the ... the Navy's really rigorous SERE training\nAnd he was talking about how\nUm as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've\nEver experienced a similar challenge or has gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now\nYeah no festivals the respect for your service and a lot watched the ... the\nA guy you rang in before you're ... you're so right there the bathroom for survival is won or lost in the mind I'm just see a training is something I went through likewise with part of the British special forces a it is long ... tough\nAnd the time on the ride I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind five cars are okay we're in today is you know however long it's going to be just break it down into the daily tasks\nAnd I she found ... you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy this as a lone survivor to look out for yourself and\nAgain you know when we're now is the crew you know when were filming stuff everything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands be needed you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else if you needed just to put a first on that will you do you know the ...\nThe everything on the right to do so much harder but it's all so busy you know I just remember that the training I went through to the days on All right it was just doing ... and as you collect firewood repairing the setting snags doing that\nAnd by the end it's like yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to say you got to keep yourself up beef you got to keep thinking like you know I always say to people in the Bible situation is never letting your mind go into neutral there's always something they are doing to think about the planning\nAnd um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on the road I I think it's three times higher than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere is one of the thing that Steven said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from your cars and actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he was he was ... he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training in as\nThinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television ever survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly may ... spending three hours trying to lie to five but I often the reality of a sudden in the old days on the bus while shows\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing this so you know hours and hours studying ... obviously that she was going to make a really boring program you know I guess edited ... bit of music and ... book is going to a guy but\nYou got to the reality of it is it is how it worked for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why is that right at the start of the show\nSurvivor of summed up three was never give up is all about that to nasty that spirit and you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why the rules to we've got to the do get that determine you know next Saturday that the Berlin the brave the strongest\nWell so let's do a lightning round a quick quick way here\nFor by the way to rabbits for a few people that's got to be no one do you love food team found like wow yeah I I end up seeing is Seventy says we we should run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave with nothing no camera crews running and they have to film everything themselves that\nYou know we come back in months later and it's like ... showing that they like street weight loss it and\nThat is the reality of survival is yet you're starving you dehydration your frighten you wet your cold and ... and you know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous as very on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nSpeaking of the the glamorous part of survival I Do\nComing in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answer so we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans and survival situation it's vital situations how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why could not be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind tests attract needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] you're like I mean there's definitely took you about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff you know so\nUm but on the whole is you're not getting the land villa by the failures that and your next time I got ... to ... that one again\nRight so I get Matt wanted to know how often is buried guessed wrong and ingested poisonous plant or animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be super caffeine and what do you I Need make big mistakes once and when it comes to\nYou know poison things I've ... mushrooms and ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if there's doubt there's no doubt darn each it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms you know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like so many things okay and then\nYou know I mean look at that story from Alaska was that one side great film you know the end of the wind in the Alaska decided in the ... and I had a baby coming on your I go wrong ran to get it wrong ones out there\nYou know by the way if you have from folks haven't rented Jon Krakauer original but it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\n[noise]\nWell hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the little tweak of an actress severely things you can snap in the wild and she's also disliked made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on our team who ... you know such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples to survive is is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity um and actually some of them have the guns the guy with a\n[laughter] a lot of who was impressive to see him

to be here and where do you [noise]\nUm so I Want to start out actually with the voice of a Supreme Court justice or because last friday on September twenty seven just the day after a Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt just so happened that justice Elena Kagan was speaking at a University of California Los Angeles law school for them\nNow or I should know I watched the whole forum it was an about an hour and a half long and Brett Kavanaugh his name was not mentioned once uh neither by Justice Kagan or by uh the UCLA moderator of the law school dean Jennifer Munn nuke in\nI Want to play for you both here anyway because I think it's as close as we're going to get to knowing what's inside the minds of justice is right now and there was this really interesting moment where ... who can ask Justice Kagan about the lessons that the justices had learned when they only had eight members on the bench after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia\nAnd Alina Kagan said the court has a real interest in preserving its institutional legitimacy and then she said this\nThe courts strength as an institution of American governance depends on it having a certain kind of legitimacy on people believing that\nIt is I'm not simply an extension of politics that it it's it's decision making has a kind of integrity to it that is something different

October eleventh to thirteenth tickets that BSO dot org [noise]\nIs on point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity and the public trust\nIn the United States Supreme court and whether or not the court itself is becoming more politicized overtime and joined today by Stuart Taylor he'd author and contributing editor for the national journal Dahlia Lithwick is also with us She's court and law courts in love reporter for slate and host of the ethnic as pod cast as well\nKind of a little walk through ah through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where politics definitely came into play ah first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven years then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October\nTwo days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation not to consent to the appointment\nAnd obviously a rubber ... ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect of the politics involved in his nomination\nMost serious and one's been injury and all of this is not to me\n... to all of those were the best we supported my nomination tomorrow I'm deeply grateful rather the damage to the the integrity of law and a public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings\nThere's certainly some national disgrace from my standpoint as a black American as far as I'm concerned it was a high tech lynching for up all the black who in any way Jane to think for themselves\nTo do for themselves or have different ideas and it is a message that unless you count town to an old order this is what will happen\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One no move forward still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't plenty tape there because he never even got a hearing so that takes us than to where we are now two thousand Eighteen and just last week\nPresident uh Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated an orchestrated political hair\nFuel with our parents pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand six Gina watch and see or that it's been unfairly stoked about more judicial record\nRevenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nDo it this week hoping ... you with us now yeah I'm here great ... thank you so much so so let me just ask you hearing sort of those voices through history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\nI you know I think it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry or we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nProbably tactically a mistake was he talked really in Folsom clear and very very certain ways about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork\nA and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being a Bork over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast\nForward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost the mirror image where since then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with very very very extensive legal records um records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of\nTheir actual ... views standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot a I have no use models and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork was the last time we had anything close to a truthful\nScrutiny of someone's record now what we have is this funny pantomime where the nominee pretends that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote in the past has any bearing and I think that sets up\nA what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very clear very coherent doctrinal record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now\nThat doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money and the Clintons because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that\nBut I think at least Bork was honest and he was when the Senate exercised it's advice and consent it did so knowing yeah\nThat's gone we'll Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that the naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination in ...\nThis is elevation to the high court\nEmphatically yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before\nA judge Bork ... a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight zero I think or maybe it was an idea to to\nUh I think was euro uh ... I don't understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them on almost every issue and even then what I said earlier was true\nAh everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can heart you know it's almost impossible to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nThe where the Democrats did was a Bork and and what made worker bird\nWas the smeared him in every conceivable way accept a sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display you know that this was how they thought they could win now with Thomas it was more complicated\nWith a cabin on who you know for all of all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his odd performance in front of the committee\nOr he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him\nI have it on good authority and it's pretty public that every one of those judges\nOr or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe\nUh that marred him in terms of judicial temperament as a level headed smart wonderful colleague\nWho uh you know who is much more conservative than most some of them in some ways but he was an excellent totally yeah you know now that's not what he looks like the person we saw on TV the other day was totally out of character\nFor a cabinet or in this process I think a drove them after a\nWhile and and and uh do you all this week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress's role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans in those hearings themselves\nBut also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants the nuclear option or push the nuclear option button in two thousand Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after that for Supreme Court nominees in two thousand Seventeen\nThat removed you know what was the most effective\nBreak in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and and its role here in creating this highly politicized environment for the court\nI I don't think there's any question I think that the fact that we're talking about what one two votes were talking about Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and the totality of this feat rests on one or two people's votes it it really I mean I couldn't agree more with Stewart that you know justices Ginsburg and Justice Scalia\nOften uh say are set in ... case look this used to be at Ninety eight nothing seems to be a Ninety four\nNothing enterprise because of the rule that everybody adhere to in the Senate was\nElections matter and if the president chooses someone who's fit we don't go after them because of perceived outcomes and that's clearly\nJust gone I Would probably say that\nThe the holding of Merrick Garland seat open and in fact I Would say the running on the proposition right because Ted Cruz and John McCain ran in the twenty sixteen election for their Senate seats\nYou're planning begins to convince voters dot com slash create [noise]\n\n[noise] today China I knew the power in the walls and China would win with ...

Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on the Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nIf you can ignore everything and this record\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old this uncertain time place date and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans golf this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm [noise]\nYou'd better watch out for your nominee\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Sen bent\nAsk a said that all the recent quote hysteria is because Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nWe have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American Life now\nOur political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys and that's a really dangerous thing and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues introduced legislation that hands lifetime tenure for the judiciary\nBecause if they're just fall additions than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments\nThat's Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break I had to interrupt you there so that we could take a break but you were talking about the fact that people are seeing politics in the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court doing its actual work and the consequences of that\nAnd that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them\nUm and I think the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception of the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation the justices view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas\nNever fully recovered from what he thinks was done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving forgotten\nHow his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that\nIf Brett Kavanaugh as elevated to the court he will look at some of the groups that are attacked him in anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justices\nA perception of the public and that's something that I think we really do you have to factor\nIn conversation\nI'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks have been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just wanted to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting or just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we\nHave justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived a preferred vote of the president that ... that nominated them and put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true but it's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nAs nominees and the Supreme Court the politics play a role it's always played a role in some sense and also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics politics doesn't play some sort of role in the court\nAnd people oftentimes do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some ways a political institutions automatically his legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to follow dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were for waiting patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get to hear from almost be through it first of all the the point of course is has the legitimacy of integrity or public\nTrust for the last two perception and if you think about\nWhat happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a adjusted to repeal replace could live because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the\nPublic's eye now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a uh easily manipulated a populist in modern history\nAnd so through the media and through a lot of other things they are a given a perception of what is what is not but to the last several months Donald Trump in his\nA blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with the snow down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans were going to go against whatever Democrats and got a lot of law\nI think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put\nSome kind of limits on terms now because it is simply a political position well\nAaron thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one thought there about from them from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits\nWith justice is well I think term limits it's a wonderful idea that's not that for twenty or Thirty years or maybe eleven years maybe\nThe problem is it'll never happen\nBecause it would require if maybe a constitutional right to even getting it through Congress\nOr the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be hurt who's ... who's people or older you know who's terms or later ... is it going to help the red team of the blue team\nAnd they're always be a calculation were of one side's thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing\nAnd neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years um but that's what's going I think that's what we're going to be seen for ... for a long time well\nLet's go to Troy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air Troy\n... thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported taken\nFor Obama and the uh keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court goal is to make the wrongs of the government against its people\nFixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that what he's going through [noise] thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the air Joe\nI'm I guess what I figured that I called the ... the if the Supreme Court and the question was going to go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justices weathering I got the right to marry my on\n'em and now I'm kind of thing that play out of gang where a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that it's a light left ideology it seems like it's more of the plane down to\nUm that was the right is actually just a code word for religious so it's a bunch of religious people on the right if you want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some standard they still want to do it and they're willing to sacrifice anything\nTo be able to give me get that chance when in reality there is no scientific reason to do it there was no scientific reason you or prohibits gay people are married it's just about ... what religious doctrine is actually going to sway that massive\n... yeah well Jill thank you for your call a deli it looks like you have a response to that [noise]\nYeah I mean I think Joe just gave us the answer to Stuart subject Gina Stewart\nCorrectly makes the point that the Supreme Court has inserted itself into all the big ticket issue that the day\nExcuse me and I think you know what you just heard was the Supreme Court was by design supposed to be a counter majorities Harry and check it was supposed to fight for their rights of minorities or when the other branches of government", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Boston", "day": "02"}
