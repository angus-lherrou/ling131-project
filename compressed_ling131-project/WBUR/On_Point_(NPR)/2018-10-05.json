university originally from Madison, Wisconsin and jak because he also runs ASU bar stool sports website jak welcome to you hire OK so first of all let me just get a quick\nSort of picture here if I were to ask you you know describe what the drinking scene is like on campus where you are how would you answer that metal and let's start with you sue\n... is a school without a Greek life so that does end up shaping a lot of what our drinking she looks like but people were mostly gravitate towards heart alcohol um especially I found during our freshman sophomore years when our call might be a little bit harder to get hold up because you're not legally able to buy it\nAnd there is a very strong blackout culture where people are generally drinking to the blackout ... that's the whole point well it's not entirely the whole point although\nI wouldn't say the goal or at a point but it is not stigmatized it's a part of our language you're it's very common to have someone said oh I Can't even remember what happened last night I blacked out and it did some point it is\nAlmost a goal depending on who your friends are the kind of social senior running in within the school maybe because of the stresses of the week but it is a release you're trying to reach that point of innovation where\nYou can't even really remember what happens next day and as you said it's it's not stigmatized and that was not in the past\nJak McCarthy what's the scene like at ASU\nOnly near sixty degrees for high for Saturday sunshine and below sixty Sunday another sunny day it'll be in the seventies

a truck a body we're talking about the drinking culture on American college campuses today I'm joined by meddling DeAngelis she's a Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard also joined us She's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and is now a first year law student at the George Washington University School of law\nAnd jak McCarthy is with us he's in Tempe, Arizona he's Twenty one ... year old senior at Arizona State university and we're one eight hundred forty three eight to five five that eight hundred for two three talk we want to know what you think about college drinking culture\nNow a and again as we talked about before\nBefore the break we're we're we're discussing this given in in the light of the hearings regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if your college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about ah what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not\nWe're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you were at\nEight hundred forty three eighty five five as I said and we got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our website uh for example a Don Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town and my residence is surrounded by college housing\nThursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical to see dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students can racks of course the next party\nA until the culture of privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed this shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest into this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York\nHe's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research on high risk alcohol consumption in college students\nFor three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Wesley Perkins welcome to you\nThank you very much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us on what you heard uh in in the previous segment and just the story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus drinking culture now a ... or we had a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\nWell I think uh what what I was hearing from them is not something I'm calling you will hear students or or even graduate says they reflect back I have to say\nUm we're in many ways though not at a very different place than we were even going back Thirty years ago if I might say a quickly with a couple of points of what the reality is on campuses based on\nA scores and scores of studies the overarching in irrefutable\nFindings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking it is significant and sometimes quite tribes and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent and they're out their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old\nAnd those are compared to any other age population and compared to non college young adults are the same age\nIs this is the heart of of the problem is when we talked about alcohol abuse and high risk\nThose levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains having said that\nEven given the relative high rates of problem drinking in college it is not now nor has ever been in previous decades the norm amongst college students\nThe best measures of a two ... of of of high risk drinking or about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally and high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent\nMight be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers\nAnd it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students consume two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on a campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched one quarter of students\nAre consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that's consume so the high risk drinking is relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious problem looking at some significant ...\nYeah so so it was a person is just one quick point of clarification um maybe you said it but I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that\nWell uh sometimes today with the word of binge drinking issues and typically what is used most commonly measures are measures such as using\nFive or more drinks at a setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences [noise] more recent decades that we've had better measures that focus on you use to talking about drinking five or four more in a two hour period because\nI mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is uh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level up\nTo a high risk levels such as a point away which was the I'm a legal limit in terms of driving when a one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas\nAnd that's a so if we were talking about drinking a far more in a two hour period without intention of some of the students were describing to alter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what is most likely to produce the consequences\nOkay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the on point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yes what I think\nIs interesting about what the difference may potentially be if we're going to talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades is that\nThere does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which when I'm stuck into my parents are people from previous generations seems to be different it seemed people seemed shock that there are just handles of ... or whatever it's easy to get a hold of\nEasily available sit like basically right off of that your freshman year and\nI don't know if maybe Brianna or jak find that to be similar experience their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here\n[noise] um I think there's probably a fifty fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking hard alcohol or beer on depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for 'em ... before football games tended to be more beer\nGear heady whereas party hosted a fraternity and eat for ... you know whatever and then tended to be more um hard liquor centric do I think that's definitely a a notable point okay and Jack\nOn I Would definitely agree with ... like if you're going to a tailgate or something it's definitely going to be beer heavy but\nI think definitely for house parties and certain things like that are hard liquor is kind of like where people are kind of having because they don't want to carry your carrying around a thirty case of beer while you're at a house party is a lot more inconvenient and just carrying around a bottle and sharing it with your friends okay wildly Perkins\nI mean you've been studying this for several decades do you see that same trend\nRight well I think it is true that are depending on what the particular context you might see more beer being consumed or [noise] or more hard liquor [noise]\nBut the the fact of the matter is that uh we could go back decades and find a a punch in grain alcohol being poured for big parties that were quite common in certain circumstances back in the Nineteen seventies eighties and so forth [noise]\nUm and uh still nationwide beers a drink of choice although a in some sectors and some schools\nAre some hard liquor may have in the increase popularity but it's when we use the word trends of uh we're just not seeing major trends without regard [noise]\nUm and the bottom line still is how many drinks you're consuming how quickly and if you haven't been eating at all or you know they can enter your bloodstream pretty quickly no matter what type of alcohol you're consuming certainly of heart alcohol can can enter your bloodstream very quickly if you're doing\nTen shots in a row and that sort of thing but if you are trying to drink as many beers as you can in a row that can be equally um a devastating too so [noise]\nUh I think we have to temper the the notion that oh this hard liquor is it's a new phenomena and and it explains all the problem is that the U.S it's a mixed picture\nSo just a we have so many college when I joined us callers I promise I'm going to get to you but I Want to ask was the ... one more question here because you know look I I get it there maybe some people listening to this saying why all the shock\nI mean you you just made me you sound like you know a a a shock teetotaler who's saying oh my God there's so much drinking on college campuses maybe it's not I mean\nDoes your car has a nickname does it hold wonderful memories of good times with family and friends\nWill make your cars last memory the best one yet donated to WVU are\nWill get top dollar for the old car and you'll be supporting the news in programming you love\nAnd you may be eligible for a tax deduction go to W. B. U. R. dot org slash cars and thanks [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking about college drinking culture today and we're joined by meddling DeAngelis she's a Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard joined us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she's a first year law student\nAt the George Washington University School of law jak McCarthy is with us either Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of\nSmith College is he's been conducting research on high risk alcohol consumption for several decades where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five hundred eight hundred for two three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio\nUh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about to return to eat\nAnd the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find a shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna\nSo that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nThat's not fair to anyone who was suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself\nNow insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress\nIt does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just\nLet me just talk to Madeline and ... and Jack here I mean respond to what's what Steven saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you\nIs it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people use to relieve stress because I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before\n[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major ways to relieve stress I think a misery to relieve stress to go with your friends and have a couple of drinks like brown Hussein you go out on Thursdays it'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks [noise]\nThere's there's not what people are going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight and give us some more of like you just it catches up I'm like you go to a party and there's like\nThere's all called her and you started drinking and drinking and then you walk out but there's a million different ways relieve stress ... is not a common one I Would say\nOK so Brianna again Stephen ... says ah why do you find a shocking to you that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak there are a million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a ... century city you go for a run or you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for a school or work or other things that are laying down on you know\nI'm or ultra light jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class in the grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and then you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to drink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nOkay good some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that\n[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time\nUm at least not now in law school in undergrad when maybe your responsibility weren't as much as they are earning now um\nGo out on a Wednesday because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that but certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nOK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to drive different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least\nIn my license blackout is kind of used almost ... really like you you you're like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means it's kind of an normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so\nWe're garlic as to what the comment on lines and [noise] I don't like I don't know that\nWe are all blacking out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language out in a way that it might not have done before\n[noise] All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the air Veronica\nHi thank you for taking my call um I just uh from here I already graduated from college and hearing all and the drinking scene in ... crazy even outside of college we have Bourbon Street and that kind of like dry your party scene of the nation\nBut I just feel like sometimes people are a little machine to speak truth only about really what goes on and drinking and it almost sounds like it's that choice\nTo go out when I've seen people blackout it doesn't seem to me like they do that on purpose they just got to a point where they can't control that drinking anymore so I guess my question would be do you think that it's always up to you whether you're going to blackout or not or if it's more that\nYou get to a certain point where you just can't control and that's when like things with\nAre happening and maybe people will say like oh maybe I can remember or maybe they just saying that it's totally not possible it just seems to me like\nI don't know it's just like lying basically because you already know that whoever drink so much as he's portrayed too with the cakes and everything like that had to be a blackout and from what you guys\nAre they speaking they ... it's like grow upgrading that it's\nLike ... you can't control that you're going to get to that point right Hi\nVeronica thank you for your call jak McCarthy my turn to you on that or I mean you heard the question what do you say\nUm I definitely say for the blackouts especially I think\nWe're missing the point to that some people do they have like bigger issues that nobody knows about so sometimes they do go out to drink and like kind of forget about their problems and I think that's also like another reason people are blocking out up there because they have issues that you don't exactly know about like I've seen it firsthand with friends and other people out of the bars\nThey have other issues and the the um mass and soon alcohol because they are trying to cover up those issues ... ... what what's your response to that question\nWell I think that if it if you start from they are going to a party are going to have ... or a point of view first of all of that told me is a segment of the population but you observe the people who are the most extreme and you go home and we're talking with your friends and have stories about\nUh the person who passed out on the dance floor or who started a fight or who uh got sick or if you had to clean them up and that sort of thing [noise]\nAnd uh we have millions of who are stories about them it can be funny to reset it can be scary I ... and so forth but we talked about is what most of the talk is about [noise]\nAnd understandably these these are situations of concern in many instances [noise]\nBut when we talk about them so much and we have thousands of words for being intoxicated but only two or three for not being intoxicated moderation being sober at an abstinence but you can think of thousands of words for being drunk\nThat reflects the talked and so consequently it tends to normalize in people's perceptions that this blackout culture as we are talking about are describing it is something that is the norm and it's accepted it's not a big deal but in fact\nThe blackout behavior which can lead to a very serious consequences particularly in terms of\nOf a sexual assault or or or or ... serious problems over there but it's it's largely knows a segment of the population but so many people don't speak out about it or against it because they think well it is enormous what most college students to read it it's the same phenomena of\nOf ah students saying well most students do this but not me that is a very common pattern and because we just don't talk about the majority who are normal and it's not just from survey research we can demonstrate this we demonstrate this with anonymous B. C. testing on campuses campuses\nAround the country who have done this and shown that\nThere may be twenty percent coming home late night with a intoxicated and the rest are coming home and not having consumed alcohol or had consumed very little so it's it's the biological evidence in Missouri ovens is overwhelming but it's still a serious problem\nWell let's go to Marie who's calling from Hartford, Connecticut you're on the Emery\nAnd there are just wanted to comment on the seemingly close relationship to sexual assault on college campuses and the use of alcohol my daughter is in a recent graduate and she confided in me that her circle of girlfriends uh six or seven of them\nW. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away\nFrom a vote in the United States Senate to end debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court if he clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow senators giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend I Will say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n[noise]\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entirety over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended\nTo guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg has where this year and they know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is that what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final\nCleanup hit for their side\nBut don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more\nConservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nAnd you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there\nSterling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll see if there are\nSome crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but today is still young [noise] ah there is a group of speakers that are standing off to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away\nOr they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults actual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot foot or a Supreme Court you cannot elevates so much of the Supreme Court has been accused of such crime director has not been founded what what they're saying shifts at\nOne of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days [noise] as well we'll talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoning from the outset\nWhen President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh from the list of names pre approved\nBy hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\n... worse than when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public discarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of transparency and fairness\nAnd finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh committed a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly do a one week investigation of the allegations an investigation which was then severely ...\nBy the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay knowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago where one week ago Democrats had nothing no say and don't when it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward when it comes to complaining about the leg two words\nNever come from our Republican friends lips Merrick Garland\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction with this nomination in reality again\nUsing Democrats as a strongman because what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience did and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work of a smear campaign are they using Dr Ford of a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her\nTestimony and then trying to blame Democrats I don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee\nWhen future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here\nAs a shameful culmination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America\nPeople who will stop at nothing to entrench in advantage when our nation's courts let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue\nTo the brazen theft of Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many years and\nA bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices and for what for\nWhom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh\nCertainly a product of an elite education but also someone with hard right conservative jurisprudence far far away from what average Americans\nWhen we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified to judge show our highest court\nNot anymore not after all this United States Senate will also\nBe making a say whether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirmed that in the United states of America every one is innocent\nUntil proven\nGuilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient\nAnd signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center the mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case\nWhat will stand up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\n\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy on Americans live\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so\nLow\nSo modern president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long\nFor on full display so let's sit back and sample a few of the choice moments that the Senate and the American people had been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks the very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice where are the junior senator from Oregon declare that just nominate would pave the way they're tearing it\nHis audience crowds of oral out protesters still filling out in the blanks on they're picking sides that weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against it\nMore\nRecently we've heard the junior senator from Hawaii you argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit and I'll listen to this he deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her you're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct that from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nApparently get due process only if you agree with her and even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties\nThat was incredibly enlightening\nInnocent jokes beer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nAnd play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh classmate set in straight earlier this week\nJust stop and consider the snap shots they absurd it the absurdity the indebtedness say this is our approach\nThe Supreme Court justice this is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct and resist\nAnd before the ACA dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee were racing to announce it made up their minds are um are totally opposes confirmation\n... hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was I was a bunch of like clearer that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president Clinton declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote was called for a few weeks\nThere are efforts played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat\nThere were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside doctor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... awesome what went on hustled vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem\nThe old players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out\nBy the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh says twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus opinions were sworn testimony written accounts from hundreds of character witnesses Raul stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character so it was clear mind president they owe taxes weren't working\nMoney going to get the job done the resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what\nHappened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow mysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the community selected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh\nFBI investigation\nBy any first entered the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence none none\nWas produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring or from anywhere else nothing well\nThat wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after all waste or to get it right now when the very FBI investigation for which they've been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats moves that goal post yeah again I Believe the\nLatest story is that the whole investigation is invalid not listen to this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty or all allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid because\nBut lately been told secondhand or third I Am about nearly forty year old allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses\nNever mind and they didn't actually witnessed anything they didn't want us anytime\nSo let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say they'll say first heard thirty five years after the suppose\nMr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will do it if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these thoughts can drag out again I go back to that ... care where there's lots of last minute drama if you know the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nVote absolutely and we do see a number of senators that there's ... very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things than I Do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central a team won historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that traumatic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare a this would be the culmination\nFor Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime really of campaigning for a change the federal judiciary unless your social listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killers [noise]\nMister Kenny Mr Udall Mr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow Racine that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so how do you see that's right or you can't have a firm sense now the final vote goes until they banged the gas\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or have assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice that year where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for clay\nTelegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has that Delaware went and checked it to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week they'll lay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and it really is it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nOr that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench and a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated\nOn the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling as is now more or less close Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevator screeners are paid professionals only looking only ... senators look\nAnd but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia home we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is key procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate that test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex comment has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco\nRubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nHe's Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\n[noise] [noise] well it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nAnd you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think it was looking for something to get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm\nThere'd been do jazz and gap has a lot of the service has shown as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have it when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through a political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was a challenge for us going into the midterms oh it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters and be more amped up and the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans\nAs a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just the nail on the coffin in terms of locking down for ... and it is yet\nThem Alex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you termed it for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWell I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee from a Republican perspective we wanted\nWe want to have a a another twenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there indefinitely while the character assassination continues\nAnd then yes I Do think part of it is the the political factor\nWhich is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee another solid\n\nIs special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place in the U.S Senate in the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia\nIs there today Republicans ah ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed\nTo fifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnd we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate to kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as long as well\nAs anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well good morning to get both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple\nOf weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court that would've been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\nWhen I was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump picked from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill to court that was sort of like a balanced bored sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the vote is five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nBe even his term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly we're not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this time so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere are three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked where you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that Annette ...\nShip that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave a speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a so that a minority cannot block\nAction and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnother one being Susan Collins of Maine who issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that you spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins\nTo a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes voting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron Elving\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it's it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would she do that\nWell that the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't\nAnd at the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor\nShe has not said that let's be you know she did not say that\nAnd and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option she may I don't think she's actually well who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that she's on her and she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a\nTime when the rules were different when that sort of thing what happened you'd get sixty votes for cloture then maybe only fifty two votes to pass\nIn there you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who was a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote\nAnd then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the fact free verdict of the mob and the media would win out over the actual\nEvidence made sure the mob prevail\nBut they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the Senate will have the final\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer today with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and that we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now ... is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ...\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learn this news of the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the\nUh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock ... but uh you know she might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know deserves about I'm going to vote no but he deserves about that could be possible I think that's likely but possible and the other person is Joe mansion who\nUh I think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a an his vote today a to his vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now\nUh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to\nI Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or reinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we are deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one\nOr plausibly although it's a long shot in both\nHouses of Congress could flip and we have mentioned in our live coverage here\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we have been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate and then the final vote\nComes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending to big as a matter of fact one senator\nSusan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that you would give a different statement sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual votes would be on the floor\nFree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes but the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote\nFor a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his\nHarsh and partisan testimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is devoted let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to your ear to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kinds of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate and you know the the odds of doing that anywhere or nearly impossible now allow much Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she's very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nAh because of the politics of\nEither their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with\nJoe ... and when we say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody representing the state well last time that I'm not a fix would suggest that not as a Democrat ... pro democratic thing I mean that as somebody who had ... going on in their voting rights go against their base so when\nYou think about um what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine\nAnd Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an out I'd still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor\nBut protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake and an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday I must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\n[noise]\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure that judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't that a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody deep promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way in which when um\nSaid when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick\nGarland and of course right after Justice Scalia died\nMerrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell says Mitch McConnell said we're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with the just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never bat an eye led and\nAnd and Obama had thought he was doing a\nI'm a a reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick that he picked a moderate he picked a moderate liberal\nOr a ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the O. J.\n... whole month and that that you feel the reverberations of that still even though it was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nAre Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listen to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also are on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and\nEvery debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick up your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen but when you're\nOn answers that I've just had which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take a moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and and and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now depends on what what are beginning point you want to want the set for when the story started to go wrong\nYes there are some similarities here and for Republicans the years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time they had just one of the year before they had one it's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they had lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan landslide and that was significant because they were winning in the south\nWith black voters they were winning with African American votes and Teddy Kennedy made the case and other senators made the case\nThat those southern Democrats really owed those black voters a long hard look at whoever was next going on the Supreme Court all along comes Robert Bork who was willing to quite freely admit he had highly conservative views remarkably eye opening eye popping views on some of the oldest Supreme Court precedents\nAnd the Democrats were appalled in the hearings he was somewhat combative himself in the hearings not to not like Brett Kavanaugh was last Thursday but he was certainly pushing back on all of the assertions that were made about him\nHelp achieve a better tomorrow MOS died or in the museum of science primary local funder of science friday today it to [noise]\n\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United states senators voted fifty one to forty nine to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected to tomorrow\nThere was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators\nWhose votes run certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nRepublican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kavanaugh or at least have to vote no against uh on on uh on on the debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes ah put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there's at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote when the final vote comes tomorrow because she said\nShe was voting yes but you give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical much narrower still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what what evidence do we have to go on as to the way she's leading will\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching this court had you know the final four voters and there is a possibility that people vote differently for cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nIs she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of that the device for education secretary in fact she wasn't out\nAnd help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the ... pensions there's your help them and yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that she still had concerns about how ... how much you would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against\nA Collins and for or against um the boss and wound up forcing a Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney has it come down and break the tie on a package of\nTax just a reminder the devoted to it was a vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and your mood choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christian ... executive vice president for policy of the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ...\nCome on and so what are you thinking about this vote\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's\nBipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct\nAnd I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw serious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nFifty yards and it's not correct to say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony and considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republican out of fifty one who voted no\nThis has been a very very partisan vote into those equally part is among the Democratic side is not\nWell I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nA usually people uh want to at least allow the vote receipt or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote it sends a really strong signal\nAbout how troubled she is by this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court\nSo I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote but I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's\nProcedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg\nSo you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine Blasey Ford letter in early\nJuly I'm an ... you you were a\nSenior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which ah Christine shifts\nBoth so at ... and and Dianne Feinstein said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone it it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it really is typically now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public\nAnd I think Senator Feinstein honored her wishes and I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about\nWhich is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story\n... ... you think about that was it impossible for her to tip off your yard to mention it to someone so there could be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island\nAh to the chairman staff and the chairman staff released the person's name um so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could\nAnd still preserved confidentiality or share it even with the FBI instill preserve confidentiality so I view it as that or if I'm really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticized\nThen I suppose we should mention in the end confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or staff have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who uh had possession of the letter we don't know who\nElse might have been told and in what way but in the end it leaked do you believe it automatically had to leak\nWas there an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been uncorroborated than that I had an individual or didn't want to go on the record\n[noise] well I I don't know who leaked it but I think that\nWhat this experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week is there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone\nOr who will said he confessed to a senator they're interrupting in in an elevator I think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women\nHave experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good and I'm I'm really worried that\nChristine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter and a campaign rally sense exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere\nThat they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nYou know let me ask about one thing along those lines from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julie ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article of touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teens\nBut said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to take seriously and investigate these kinds of allegations a difference between that broad issue and the specific question of whether a specific individual can be proved guilty through some neutral process here\nHas there been some confusion of one with the other on this issue people who are concerned about the broader issue have assumed that Kavanaugh must be guilty because they're concerned about the issue or the reverse for that matter\nWell first they would say this is not about his guilt or not kill this is a job interview and Republicans prevented any corroborating or supporting witnesses from being hurt by the committee and then Republicans prevented the FBI\nFrom reaching out to people who would support Christine Blasey Ford's account or Debbie Ramirez is account so I find it really troubling that\nNinety two boys seven WVU ages break eighty nine boy one WB UH Brewster and streaming or W.

be hard pressed to come up with better bookends than the following today the U.S Senate voting to cut off debate on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and move to a final vote despite allegations of sexual assault and has passed\nAnd one year ago today with a New York times broke a bombshell story\nThe times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer in the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen one recent that out into the world we\nDidn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because the times was doing bigger investigations sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's going to happen to investigation wet it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party\nLike to say as we were working on it he said hurting wine skiing is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and ... really was not a household name 'em\nAnd and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to park\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and\nAnd there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were all then it ... or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge happened I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger let me ask you this\nIf Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a setback to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this is a set back he was confirmed anyway\nUh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um\nWomen were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of ... to hell the other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presidents and we also some moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able to literally stop a national conversation for a second and say listen to these stories\nOne footnote to this conversation before I let you go Jody ... we just heard there from our reporter psoriasis or hurting awesome but today also marks the order of the Nobel Peace prize prize that is often Xena sending a political message\nUm any word went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you like to the global scope of this me to moment that you hope set in motion\nA year ago I woke up to the same news and had the same side I think it's a reminder scale I think it's a reminder of a global reach that\nAnd also media reminder perspective at a moment when we're all so immersed in the cabin on the news media this as a reminder that this topic is it's even bigger than that in a way\n[noise] Jodi Kantor she broke the Harvey
