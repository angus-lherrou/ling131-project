host of running wild with their grills he's author of the new book how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation\nUm end up before they make their break a few me before the break a bear people tell me I've talked too fast so maybe I should slowdown here I'm a you were telling us you've got a couple of friends there in the studio that was unexpected to me because we didn't know or that you'd have anyone else with you on your end in London but you know what even sparked me about\nA this is talk about the survivors mindset and getting outside your comfort zone so we're going to get outside of our little radio comfort zone here for a minute I get you would if we can you reintroduce us to you too who your friends are and he said they have an incredible survival story\nWell what I'm saying is that survival is this is so much about the spirit you know and the rest of it as the arena that we ended up playing and whether you're stuck in a life raft or whether you're in a plane crash or whether you're dealing with bereavement illness or whatever it is all about having not survive the spirit\nAnd you know it's it's a it's great I Love being yeah love to hear about this I'm excited to to get questions from your listeners but I always try and kind of\nBringing inspirational people as well in a band that Simon to\nA couple that I've met they reach out to me that you'll hear that story in a minute but I really wanted to meet them and say hey come and join me fussing few because this is a fun one and I will take some questions and all of that but what they know about is is togetherness and an holding on uh-huh I'm OK and Ben is aged\n... eleven fellow man Simon is is that so I've been to go\nTo a little bit about your ... well hey man I'm Sorry for the first of all since I don't know who you are it on our listeners don't know can you just introduce yourself a little more fully what what's your full name and where where are you from I'm\nI'm Benjamin almost a uh I'm from ... in England them\nAnd and your eleven okay and your dad as Simon sitting next to you there in London yeah that's correct yes hello Simon what's what's your full name also from Cheshire I presume I yes some insight also from ... okay well the great to have you with surprise guests on this show so so tell us a little bit about what bears talking about what's your your survival story\nI'm a doctor will tell you okay he's a bit nervous or the wind or it's all in an unexpected\nBent bend house quite ... um he he can be hospitalized for about four days our time I'm being unable to freeze 'em\nSo he's on regular ... medication for that but he he wants to get back on the five cent so\nHe's he's tried ... simple most recently um but as program on this new book especially as inspired him to go out and about so he looks going climbing into my own since he's always pushing himself\nA ... every time we go um he he uses an inhaler low but he's really talking back on using the inhaler now so he's really pushing himself getting higher up the mountains like Mr early on\nYou know using the inhaler last see he's he's really pushing him so she knew spirits no\nWell that sounds great and and and Ben let me just turn back to you really quickly so uh what is what is it about about bear and what he's done and his book that inspires you to to push yourself why why do you want to do that\nUm it rains rationing because them all the things in that I cannot will still for namely thinking rumors or anything it's just inspirational\nOkay well so let's see how far the inspiration goes 'cause I Want to play a clip here from two thousand seven this is from an episode of bear grills man versus wild and he was dropped into the rugged terrain of Western Australia and he ran out of water and here's what happened next\nTime they will bring my on pay and Mrs [noise] sorry I've never done before [noise] and on my face and it's been pretty horrible [noise] but I Need to keep going and [noise] it may seem disgusting but you are in your in it's safe to drink [noise]\nFair grills a re hydrate ing in Western Australia in two thousand seven uh then I'm going to like you and I forget that [laughter] I'm gonna let you off\nThe first time I go and tell you that bend you're lucky what do you drink you know you're lucky if you will suffer the cubs [laughter] how about a novel with an apple juice then would you go so far as to drink you're in if you had to stuck on\nA mountain [laughter] depends [laughter]\nWell Ben Simon thank you for being a surprise guest this hour or ... let me let me turn back to you or was it disgusting it sounds like it was\nA ... a lot of things and survival of disgusting you know but I'm Glad you got to leave your prejudices behind you got to do whatever it takes and survival food is never going to ... nice and survival\nYou know fluid set need I taste nice but it's about doing whatever it takes you know and and I'm definitely not one of these people who drinks pay for found the center of there if you ... and actually I've met a few of them over the years and that kind of make a swift exit if I get Qunu by somebody tells me they do it for fun or you don't have housing\nIn your book though how to stay alive ad on page twenty here you actually have this really great a diagram of below ground solar still\nThat if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia a dig a hole in the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic you put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it\nAnd the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole will actually condense a underneath the the plastic and drip into a cop and you say they say here if you you earn eight in the whole before setting up the still\nMoisture and your your will condense into clean drinking water why didn't you do that\nUnless you get the thing is if you're really de hydrated\nDrinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you're just into pure waste product\nSo if you can make a cell is still like this you have the you have the the resources to do that\nPaying into the bit around that is gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you you're going to get flus out of that but if you uh well hydrated when you find yourself stranded in survival situation for example you call it breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrated you don't want to be paying out\nThose fluids because actually if you pay is clear\nThat that can actually help hydrate you so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways may be paying onto your clothes and wrapped around her head to Kuti ahead\nUm you know and he he's a little things about the bunch of times I mean it\nWas right for you love looking back into it because what if it was a crew to guide you stink then a few days we'll move ... just wrapped around my neck in a on a headscarf a pie and [noise] you know but he said let's see if it's about whatever Italians in it since you mentioned your\nCrew I've always wondered I mean how ... your crew was there with you with their equipment having to go through the same terrain and as you are I mean how how how much do you ask of them in terms of a ... of having a survival mindset or doing the things that you're even doing\nI'll tell you what they are they're incredible they really are they're being with me from day one small team\nYou know we're real kind of band of brothers and a foot of respect and admiration and everything you kind of thing can hype about them is true you know they always say hey you have these huge oh we're going to do everything you do the back woods carrying a camera you know and it's a bit you know\nBe under no illusion they are incredible and they work the hardest and the the real unsung heroes and the whole story\nAll right well we're speaking with their grills he is host of

I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind five cars are okay we're into this you know however long it's going to be just break it down into the daily tasks\nAnd I she found ... you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy this is a loving survive it to look up to yourself and\nAgain you know when we're now as a crew you know when we were filming staff everything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands be needed you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else if you needed to put a first on that well you do you know the ...\n... everything on the ground is so much harder but it's all so busy you know I just remember that see a training I went through the the days on All right it was just due to a doctor and if you collected firewood repairing the setting snap as doing that\nAnd by the end in sight yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beef you gotta keep thinking like you know\nI always say to people and it's survival situation is never letting your mind go into neutral is always something they are doing to think about the planning and um and that's why it becomes very draining the times on the right I I think it's three times harder than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere just one of the thing that Steve had said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from you because then I actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was man and he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was\nThinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly may ... spending three hours trying to lie to five and ... and the reality of a sudden in the old days on the Memphis while shows\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing this or you know hours and hours studying ... obviously that she was going to make a Rudy boring program you know I guess edited down and for you know it's like a bit of music and ... book is going to a guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why I said right at the start of the show survivor of summed up three was never give up is all about that so nasty that spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why the rule it's always got to that do get the determine you know next Saturday to the Berlin the brave the strongest\nWell so let's do a lightning round a quick quick thing about it right here for\nBy the way to rabbits for a few people [laughter] that's got to be no one the last ... food team found in the early ... yeah I I I'm not saying that Seventy says we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave them nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFilm everything themselves that you know we come back in months later and it's like ... like stream weight loss it\nAnd that is the reality of survival is yeah you're starving you ... your frighten you wet your cold and ... and\nYou know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous it's right on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nWell speaking of the the glamorous part of survival I Do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answers that we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans and survival situation it's survival situation how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why couldn't it be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind to subtract needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] I'm like I mean they definitely don't care about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff and I saw\nUm but on the whole is you're not getting the land ... by the failures that and your next time I got ... to ... that one again\nRight so I get Matt wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingest poisonous plant or animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said or not\nOr do you I Need make big mistakes once and when it comes to\nYou know poison things I've ... mushrooms and and ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt don't eat it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms you know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that ... like so many things okay and then\nYou know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one such a great film you know the end of the wind the Alaska decided in the ... and I had a baby coming on our own ran to get it wrong ones out there\nAnd by the way if you have it from folks have already Jon Krakauer original book it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\n[noise]\nWell hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress severely thinks she can snap in the wild and she's also disliked made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit and all the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible Geraldo ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on a team who ... you know it's such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples to survive is is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity\nUm and actually some of them they have the guns the guy with the you know [laughter] or that if it was impressive to see as well\nAll right one more a lightning round here question Sam Winston on Twitter or say on our website says beer can you do your classic how like when you accomplish a big Clyde thanks that's from Sam\nCome on let me give out the were on it we're moving on a ski guys stay positive protein in we can do that\nThey grill and his

woods you can't or use any part of a pine tree\nIt's high income you know drink the water from the Congolese part but I Can't find the information to know what that is true or not\nThat is true that the the pine tree is one of the unsung heroes of the wilderness so much you can do everything you mentioned but also more you know the old days they used to use the reds and mix it with a charcoal from afar make glue outta that\nUh you know ... ... ... to ... uh there's so much to do I spend a lot of time is moving through forests just chewing on the chewing on the needles good victim and see you know I mean you think of all of the classic old Raul navy and the old days sending around the world\nAnd ... and things ... and everyone was dying lack of intimacy and yet they were harvesting pine trees whether we're going to replace them moss and the ships but will they didn't realize that the the the pine trees could give them a lot more than just good new\nMosque some that ship it could

U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas\nBrandon running house joins us as well he's a political science professor at the University of Houston joining us from Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel I feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between\nCrews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas\nOh what is the Texas race mean to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nAshley Lopez I wanted to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth in the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that\nFifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here\nTwo and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between uh since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc ... not monolithic and rented was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there\nYeah and Latinos are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group\nAnd they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who said that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group a\nLatino voters is that they haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore it costs a lot of money and Texas\nAnd progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see a good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party\nI'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work than has yet Ian\nI see a brand and running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nOr will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's ah um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent yeah they're they're low\nRecent polling has got more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nAre meant for outdoors the kind of people who want to get to remote places so it's small and zippy and he can fit skis or hiking or camping gear and it easily and it's just a joy to dry it\nAnd we should stress you get your pick if you want the cross track if you want the outback these are both fantastic cars one thing that I I'm really interested in is\nThe the the the something we have the wheel all she does is Ninety eight percent of sue Bruce sold in the last decade or on the road today that is some amazing longevity if you're like me I drive my car until it dies\nSo you're like me this is the car for you and this was a car you could win by doing your part for the new year WB you are one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to a seven or online at W.

bar the we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez Brandon rotting house and Abby Livingston\nAs well unless you're a some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to you and and watching on their televisions\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad\nWhere [noise]\n\nEnjoy she wants to actually burn churches margins\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto ... campaign and here's some sound from an ad that ripped the Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running\nWild so\nTo Jim\nLiberal\nAn ad there from Senator Ted Cruz Brandon running house that that Ted Cruz add ... ... talk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to some things that that a lot of Texans hold dear I mean the the right to gun ownership but the idea that\nI'm a ... you may be liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas\nYeah I thought you're going to say that this was something that holds the Texans hold dear because it's like country music but I think that's true as well\nThere's definitely a a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign understands how to run in taxes they know that there is a certain size guys as you say for\nVoting um to keep you know people's guns I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely enough Republican support\nYou in a midterm election that an organic\nKind of campaign that relies on priming Republicans through these conservative policies can work or work\nHas to tangibly make up about a million votes and the just assure as God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in mid term so the difficulty of trying to make up that with a campaign like Cruz's running which primes Republicans and primes conservatives it just makes it really difficult well\nLet's take a call here Christine is calling from San Antonio Texas Christine you're on the air\nGood morning I'm just calling and I made millennial voters and for the twenty sixteen election I had ...\nAnd um I grew up in a conservative household my husband is conservative my whole family is but I've been very encourage and I and voting for that to work this election in November just because he looking beyond party line and I think that's so important\nTo 'em in this day and age right like you're either a Republican or Democrat\nI Am a mother and I have two children and I think it's so important that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that don't work is going out there and I'm making it a point to meet people where they're at ... and um I really appreciate what he's doing\nChristine touched a quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year yes I did go so what's changed their\nHand in that um I really ... whenever he was in the twenty the female action\nAnd how you get like the talk that whenever he was talking to\n'em President Trump and just how\nLike how he stood against them and all of a sudden he decided oh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that you're a true um I think it's important that person's true colors and how he just\nWas really again President Trump also nice for him like yeah that's that's not to show you something about sunny personality how I really appreciate how does your work is just um he is who he is\nOf course the owners that you can ask you one more question I'm again I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that you you think that you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the ... campaign recently right to\nA controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or a review for a Broadway musical of where he is in the review he wrote some I'm\nAn unkind things about the female actresses in that Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualification seem to be their phenomenally large\nBody parts or need to say it does that concern you\n[noise] um I I don't know um [noise]\nI Know he's apologized for it ... and um [noise] I I honestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for them making it all I just don't get that for a woman right\nYeah ... ... I I just wanted to I don't know is a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably what gets us in trouble so so thank you so much for your call\nAbby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked I Do wish talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more positive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In ... in taxes that's just sort of a an ... I Would call these women a husband should stand up for his wife\nAnd so it's it's a tough ... he was and I do think if this was John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave 'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came\nFrom a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not\nNFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military in Oregon ... ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful um and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated frankly with people like me and the vision of public draws in power who have been unable to resolve this or bring justice for what has been drawing and this is all from January to happen in this country and so long ago I won't leave peacefully\nMajor funding for onscreen is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and ranchers

Stanford she's the obesity she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital\nAnd Dr Stanford and Michael so many colors I just want to let people have their say let's go to Seth who's calling from Johnson\nHi thanks for taking my call\n'em so I just come on to talk about something the Michael brought up near the beginning of the food and we talked about the way that his mom was treated kind of um by her friends and then kind of her behavior home um I think it's really interesting because I've struggled with my weight my entire life\nUm but I've never really what my wait hold me back it always seems to be the prejudice reaction\nI'm kind of the stigma and things like that but I get from other people\nUm that really hold me back so Johnson City Tennessee this huge area outdoors activities or giant um\nSo I'm always very active however there have been several times in my entire life where I just don't get included and thing because people think that my weight will hold them back uh-huh I'm so it's kind of interesting but it doesn't just affect me but it also affects my relationship on a broad\nYeah well ... thank you for your call a and thank you for sharing your story I Want to get Cindy in here who's calling from Charlotte North Carolina Cindy you're on the air\nHi thank you I got to play one of about the definition of obesity I Am a very low killer very active by well and when I get on the scale I Am airports obese\nSo it ... the very definition of a case they will tell us enough to fail and like high\nRight now the em I write\nIt that that's that's that's one point the most important one I think it's that I never hear anyone talk about what is underlying the eating behavior so you know as a society we treat symptoms\nNot pauses I Know so many very obese are at absolute caretakers their school a foster kids they're carrying for everybody no time for them so they ... themselves ... hit the food that you\nLove so close and personal heretic and I never hear not walk with I don't talk about that\nMaybe a solution for obesity is treating the beneath the people in the\nSenate is Cindy let me just jump in here thank you for your call because doctors Stanford go ahead yeah so am I said you have an address few appoints thanks so much for calling you a number one I'm you talked about the mind which is what the World Health organization uses for obesity and I would say definitely there are some some challenges with that I can tell you\nThat with each patient that I see I pay attention to the weight\nAnd then how can I pay very close attention to wait distribution so central to possibly mean weight that's carrying that mid section\nIs most concerned because that does predisposed patients to um heart disease and other illnesses such as fatty liver so I Would say that if for someone like yourself who seems to be a more muscular where it would be a mind would not be necessarily the best criteria\nI Would pay attention to that we circumference targeting a waste of comforts of thirty five inches or less than we do have significant study's based upon ATP three guidelines that support that\nI'm with regards to the psychology I'm actually if you look at um doctor ... I'm Sorry Michel hops article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr ...\nFrom them gee each week center was interviewed and we do have all of our patients and spend time with the psychologist delving two issues um such as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behaviors because of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life\nSo I Do think that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like doctors all working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops to do a good job by bringing those voices into the army so I Want to switch you can\nSwitch gears here for a second um and and take a step back and Michael I'll bring you in back in here for this as well\nBecause I'm Dr Stanford I just I heard you a couple of times in this conversation you know call ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight\nBut fifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese American anywhere where near what we have now so I mean I don't I don't think anyone's gonna say that\nNo the this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and ... and so who [noise] this is such a ... person question but I just want to get your field for an ... and Michael you too [noise]\nIs it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it's kind of happened overnight absolutely I think\nThis is I'm really we are in an OB so Jenike environment so I call it the perfect storm\nWell we have is we have had a change in our food quality we've had a change in our physical activity we've had a change in the quality in duration of our sleep we've had a change in circadian rhythm um disturbances what I mean by that is that we are rewarded with being a\nAnd talk to our colleagues in India when we're supposed to be sleep here in the United states would tell you that maternity is terrible for our house [laughter] and I say that not not jokingly right if you're talking about sleep and and physical activity and food and especially for people who you know a lower income getting that high quality food Michael you pointed this out it's like eight times more expensive\nThan the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega\n[noise] yeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less and exercise more\nBut as soon as that people have the time to exercise and that their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids\nAnd two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people you know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids you're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen in process and whatever else\nAnd that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have we we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and the choices that we make with in those options\nI don't think there's blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them\nTo do and so the reason why I wanted to bring this up to up to Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and um\nEven in that context this conversation is it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know ... individual responsibility as things that can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to look way outside\nOf that out I mean we have to go outside the box we need to bring together persons and healthcare persons in that our policymakers\nUm physical activity facility schools et cetera I always talk about bringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a in a direction where we actually\nHad any dead on obesity rates in both a pediatric an adult population and and I think what we've done um with regards to this epidemic his work entirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and\nOh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive for the U.S and for the world\nWell let's get another call in here arenas calling from Providence Rhode Island Reno you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call um I Am a primary care doctor and Johnston Rhode Island just

U. T. we've got links to her latest stories on the Texas Senate race at one point radio dot org Ashley Lopez welcome to the program\nThe magna so first of all like well why do some of the basics here for people who aren't as familiar with the Texas Senate races obsessive politics watchers might be I mean how close is the race right now between a Senator Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke if you ask\nSome experts they say it's a toss up pretty much um all the polls have had cruise with a slight edge but you know as the election has gotten closer\nUm the polls have got the two candidates closer which is surprising a lot of people because as you mentioned this is not a swing state so a Sweeney election especially for mid term is it's ... it's just really surprising in Texas so a toss up and has it been like that consistently for the past couple of months or is is it narrowing or or widening\nWell in the beginning it seemed like this was you know get not going to be a ... a race at all I mean when that over at first and now he's a congressman by the way in El Paso\nWhen he first announced everyone's like you know this is a really interesting candidate a lot of people like him on he's you know really interested in working with you know that Republicans in Congress he's well known for being friends with will hurt who's a Republican in Congress so that was kind of a thing as she was\nReally a bipartisan friendly guy um but you know they didn't think that a ton of money would flood flood into Texas where this race so you know it was going to seem like a long shot for better work but um it's only in the past couple of months that it seems like this race is getting closer than anyone expected okay and so\nBe cloudy nights and I ... in the mid fifties becoming partly sunny demar loaded mid seventies or high temperature tomorrow [noise] this is not a boy nine WB you are\nWere funded by you our listeners Dana Farber Brigham and women's Cancer Center\nBridging science and humanity with new treatment options including personalized cancer vaccines a liquid biopsy to determine if a cancer treatment as working and therapies based on a patients' genetic profile learn more have you ever dot org [noise]\n\nRoom at\nThis point I'm making to shock her body we're talking about the race for Senate in Texas and that's the race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz\nAnd congressman Beto O'Rourke it's a close race which is surprising a lot of people and it's why it's one of the reasons why it's maybe one of the most watched Senate races in the country right now ahead of the midterms\nAnd we are joined today by Ashley Lopez she's a senior reporter for K. U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas Brandon running house joins us as well he's a political\nJoining us from Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel like to feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between crews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas\nOh what is the Texas race means to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nAshley Lopez learned to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth in the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that\nFifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between uh since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc that are ... not monolithic\nAs rented was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there\nYeah and look you know there are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group\nAnd they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who say that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group\nA Latino voters is that\nThey haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore costs a lot of money in Texas\nAnd progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see a good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party\nI'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work done has yet Ian I see\nA brand and running house so we can focus and a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nOr will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's\nAh um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent\nYeah they're they're low overall um recent polling has gotten more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo nine to ... percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's\nA lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring Ted Cruz and so now we've kind of morphed into one bigger sort of\nMore continuous unit for Republicans that support Donald Trump out there's a lot of friction so\nI see so so is there another group of voters that we should be talking about here as potentially influential in this race I mean white suburban white women or women in general\nYeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election that's really gonna what's probably drive any kinds of success that will walk fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challenges the congressional level many of whom have\nA really harness this vote and could potentially do well but I think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks ... considerably in favor of better work\nThey don't treat typically vote in the same numbers that we see for people who are over forty but it is the case that those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in\nThese big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual rows of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being of our luck poor partner\nPlaces like forbidden county here outside of Harris County outside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another level of success the Democrats might find so\nAshley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in in this race in November\nWell it's always the wild card and elections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always say a big reason that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it's because it's a non voting state\nSo if you get all these populations who don't usually vote that could change what Texas looks like if you changed the electorate you can change who gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term\nI mean this is a weird mid term because you know everyone's kind of excited and and and\nDemocrats aren't likely to vote during the term so if if that is different this year like this could look different than most midterms now so I'm seeing\nFor example Beto O'Rourke um\nUh a couple of Saturdays ago is quoted as having said our contention is that if no one's ever showing up\nAnd listen to you talking to to to voters\nOr or potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so it was he hoping to draw out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the tactics that we've seen in other places we saw that\nIn New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example\nLike what he's betting on yeah go ahead written in ...\nOh sorry I was gonna say yeah it's definitely the case like actually said that the turnout in ... in mid term years you're talking about\nProbably on the order of about forty percent which is extremely low now I think we'll have a turnout probably spike a little bit in this election because you definitely have the energy that we've seen 'em and so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you\nStill have about two and a half million on register Texans who could otherwise register the Latino population is only registered to vote at about forty forty four percent and that number is about eighty percent for Anglo so there's still some fundamental voting demographics and make it really difficult for Democrats to win statewide\nOkay well I Want to listen to a little bit more from the candidates themselves and by the way I should note that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign and to Congress and better or worse campaign as well invited them or or one of the represent their representatives to join us today\nAerobics campaign declined our request and senator Cruz's campaign never responded to our class but we do our due diligence on that part\nBut let's hear from the senator anyway this is from the uh the Senate debate that they had on September twenty second and Senator Ted Cruz was asked about his contentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen the election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said\nI have worked hand in hand with the president\nOn substance and we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax cut of a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and cut regulations we're seeing record low unemployment Texans lives are better so yes I could have chosen\nTo make it about myself to be selfish and say you know what my feelings are hurt so I'm going to take my marbles and go home but I think that would have been not doing the job I was elected to\nThe Senator Ted Cruz on September twenty second let's take a call here Dan is calling from San Antonio you're on the air Dan\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em I wanted to say that\nWell there's a lot of work and I know don't have all that much time but I did want to say that about two or gives me and my family's in ... that we haven't felt love generation or my parents would say like John F. Kennedy or the Kennedy family inspiring us to to have some hope\nBecause living in this so called red state wakes us cringe every time I hear that because we were starch blue family and everyone I Know just about is\nA at least inside their county here in San Antonio I'm however we are very diverse state and it's all good and like the message that list for years about\nHope and moving forward whether you're a Republican Democrat independent because we're so sick of the bigotry and hateful comes from Mr Trump will do you see and that's not what we're here in San Antonio in Texas and probably most of American people are just that the message\nDr Peter Oreo vice chair of network operations at Dana Farber Brigham and women's Cancer Center on WB you are under writer [noise]\nWe've chosen to underwrite on WB Network his mistress devoid of communicate the importance of personalized cancer treatments when a team of specialists focus on specific types of cancer\nTreatments based on a patient's individual cancer in biology\nPatients you see progress cure\nFor more information go to W. B. U. R. dot org slash sponsorship this is on point\nI'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez Brandon rotting house and Abby Livingston\nAs well unless you're a some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to end and watching on their televisions\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad\nWe weren't\nDollars off\nThe Georgetown wants to actually burn churches mortgage\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto ... campaign and here's some sound from an ad that ripped the Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running\nTo jail\nAgain I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that ah you you you think that you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the campaign recently right to\nA controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or a review for a Broadway musical of where he is in the review he wrote some I'm\nAn unkind things about the female actresses in that Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualifications seemed to be their phenomenally large\nBody parts or need to say it does that concern you\nUm I I don't know um [noise] I Know he's apologized for it ... and um I I honestly I don't know I Know that\nI mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for some Mickey apologize but just don't get that for a woman's right yeah ... ... I I just want to say I\nDon't know is a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably what gets us in trouble so who thank you so much for your call Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked to the we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more\nPositive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In ... and taxes that's just sort of a an ... I Would call these women has been should stand up for his wife\nAnd so it's it's a tough conundrum humid than I Do think if this is John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave 'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came\nA from a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not\nNFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military and are working to ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful um and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated friendly with people like me and those visions of public trust in power who have been unable to resolve is or bring justice for what has been drawing and this is all from drip drip drip of in this country and from Long Island we peacefully\nWhile we argue this country are watching these games they take on the street or changes that are good for this problem to ensure that we regard as why they're doing it and I can think of nothing more American than some people [noise]\n\nActually Lopez or as I mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in Texas well\nI mean if you look at the black vote in Texas I Would say it went over really well specifically among black voters yeah something like Ninety seven percent approval according to like one latest poll on that one might be a little high but it it's not unlike most polls that have come out\nUm you know conservatives this is red meat for them this is something that Ted Cruz had been talking about um the NFL or in the the protest during the national anthem he's been talking about his rallies\nBecause it really frustrates conservative and they see this as like disrespectful to the flag into veteran so you know if you look at like democratic base voters this is something that they are so excited to hear you know a Democrat\nI'm standing up for racial injustice in their eyes and then on the on the other side you know conservative voters you know this is a polarizing issue so conservative voters see this very differently and are very frustrated by this\nBrenda running house I mean I think ... outside of Texas political watchers are saying that perhaps this is the way better or talks about these issues are is one of the reasons why he's getting so much traction there that it's not", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "03"}
