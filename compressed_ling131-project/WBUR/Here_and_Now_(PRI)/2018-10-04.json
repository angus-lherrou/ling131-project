I Will say that uh the the vice president did cite one instance of the hacking attack a computer attack on the Hudson Institute itself the host of his speech today after that Institute\nA invited a speaker that China was not in favor of so there was some discussion here of cyber attacks yeah\nLook at your damage speech very briefly the vice president reached out to China do you think Beijing how will baking react very briefly\nI think Beijing is\nConcerned about the aggressive posture that this administration has taken towards China whether we're talking about militarily whether we're talking about the trade posture a and I I think the sort of rhetorical open hand that Pence extended will be overshadowed\nBy the much more aggressive telling the most of the speech and he'll have caused by Scott Horsley thank you You're welcome itching\nFor here and now comes from W.

B. or he joins us now account hijacked and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with pastures\nSo the projection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective a spending usually does grow year over year but the\nAverage growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like Macy's\nRight so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic and brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year\nIs way fair the online furniture retail or they are experimenting with temporary\nBrick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they would just be showrooms you can actually buy them there you see them in the physical space in that order on\nLives of the ... model of where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers\nQuite so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days suits could increase minimum pay the Fifteen dollar an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season the market research firm weak field of research published a survey last week of a thousand retailers\nAnd report the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars and forty cents and that's a big jump from an average eleven in Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just above seven dollars an hour a nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on get sick\nTariffs are has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... or the tariffs are especially on Chinese imports could make their costs to go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers one\nMore thing or kill them big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on here\nRight so it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest in ... eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on and investors' minds but of course they're weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury notes considered very\nSafe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get into riskier stock market\nBut if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market\nAnd maybe mortgage rates and other things also start to pick up even more ... of WB or thank you so much with your\nWas we heard earlier a vice president Mike Pence took a hard line on China today including a stint on Taiwan saying well administration will continue to respect or one China policy Taiwan's embrace of democracy shows a better path for all of the Chinese people\nKind of course insists Taiwan is part of its territory and actively works too isolated diplomatically\nAnd that power struggle is playing out in an unlikely region only Seventeen countries in the world still recognized Taiwan including several in Latin America\nAs part of our continuing series on China's expanding role in the world NPR's Carrie Kahn reports on a small and poor region of Latin America increasingly embroiled in Asia's diplomatic tool", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "04"}
