time at the Roma yawn a shopping mall you remember that was this huge shopping mall that was destroyed in the disaster but I have to say Robin there is no mass government mobilization\nOne week later that is absent this is a do it yourself affair I'm full of good Samaritans\nYeah and and in the areas that have been devastated I mean the pictures just ... you know we almost get numb to these pictures of toppled homes and buckle roads and smashed cars in body bags um but you know what how do you take that and\nYou know you you take it in with personal stories of people\nYou take it in with the man who sits and described to you and he's had with a far off looking as I\nUm this complete conflict that he has inside his his self\nThat he ... that that he survived but at what cost he kept saying things like\nIt you you may think we were selfish when we just ran um because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left the father behind he said he was he was praying in his house he said we had seconds to\nTo get out um and they were luckily on the street she looked up germs or saw wall of water coming at them\nAnd just ran its you know in some ways it's it's so serendipitous and miraculous that people survive these these sorts of events because this this uh sue nominee is coming at them like a locomotive and it's just building steam and it's building height and so I think it's a the\nPersonal stories um of of people who whose lives are completely shattered you know there are thousands tens of thousands of people whose livelihood has been destroyed\nThe economics of this city robbing are simply not an up and going concern right now yeah and the vice president said it's going to take two years for that to happen\nI think by the look of it it will take much longer but you know this question but what does it look like there are you you you would be forgiven if you drove through and thought ah some areas the Joe Joe through some areas and said well there are there what could possibly have gone wrong here\nAnd other areas that are completely\nOn on recognizable\nFor example a church moved and entire over and over a mile it was moved by the churning earth below it\nIn one area I'm ... a vast expanse set on swamp land it must be said was part of this churning of the earth someone called it said the ground was like a blender the earthquake was like a blender just gobbling up houses and its weight then you don't know\nHow many people are are are are lying beneath that that mountain mountain of mud is what I saw and so that will take a long time to do on earth and they don't have the equipment here to do it yet\nAnd that is part of the mystery of this place I mean it's really not knowing how many people perished\nNow we know a French rescuers were very frustrated they thought that with their equipment they heard signs of life under a four star hotel the collapse now they're thinking that that might have been a gas leak or something that they the there is no life there that you mentioned the lack of coordinated government response\nSo yeah long term recovery but what about you know tomorrow to people have food do they have water\nThey don't have food they don't have water there are scrounging for it and they're begging borrowing it\nOn there are people coming in from the outside driving for hours to deliver aid\nUm

here evidently of hundreds of tons of supplies they're just not getting here you don't see evidence of it there was no running water electricity is extremely spotty um gasoline again extremely spotty and people who get it are leaving\nNPR international correspondent Julie McCarthy in Palo Indonesia and the\n... ... it was also a donkey now Julie thank you so much\nThank you Robin well the United states is not the only country dealing with political polarization Sunday's election in Brazil is expected to be the country's most polarized vote in decades\nThere's widespread distrust among the electric because a record number of lawmakers have been caught up in a massive corruption scandal polls show that's driving voters too far left and far right candidate joining us now from Rio de Janeiro is Tim francs or the BBC Tim\nOr what's at stake in this election in Brazil\nWell for a lot of people do say that democracy is at stake and the reason they will say that\nParticularly opponents of the man who is leading the presidential campaign including the opinion polls that they said because he ... he's a fall right congressman who's\nThe sort of sprung from ... ah he's a threat to the Democratic norms are in Brazil and this is just says he is remember from when there was a middle tree dictatorship here so will vote democracy is vibrancy in this country\nThat people don't take it for granted equally supporters of Mr ... and already said that they are the ones who are going to rescue Brazil's from the clutches of the people who have been responsible for a surge in crime a surgeon corruption and the worst recession\nThat the country has ever experience so they say that\nYou know Brazil is on the mortal threat if the left gas and hence Europe's the rights to about ... but also the language people use about what is at stake in this election could not be more fruit\nAnd we should also remember that two of the last few presidents or one of them is in jail right now the other was forced out of office\nYeah and that is ... under pins are a lot of the opposition to the main challenges to this fall right presidential candidates because the work is policy the P. T. to give it it's a Portuguese accident\nThey would impact she hasn't been she's two thousand and six team\nAnd I only watch the largest corruption scandal that Brazil is that a theme and in fact these mashed much of Latin America at two groups\nAnd ... presidents of messier Lula da Silva who was a two term president in Brazil or the P. C. had\nBeen hoping to feel the same as the candidate in this election\nBut he was sentenced to twelve years in jail for corruption of the year and so they put up put this all the men and onto a dodgy who ... more colors a lot less charismatic and he's funny difficulties is the second in the opinion polls at the moment but he's funny difficult\nTo punch through against the\nThe brush populism of ...\nOr people excited about this election or some people not even gonna bother to vote because of all this other\nThing is I like to be honest I think people are on tens of hooks about this election and I think a lot of people\nA feeling that so she's a state so polarized so the choices facing them but they really have to choose the apathy isn't\nIsn't an option and I think one of the key things that you have to remember\nHere is that although an awful lot of people do feel visual ... is misogynistic racist homophobic a man in the past to to warmly about dictatorship or even about those who\nTortured and killed for the state's\nLoss of people feel very strongly that the workers policy has had eight shops in Brazil and on their watch\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners

but these are some of the most fervent supporters uh of senators who tried to convince to vote against the cabinet nominations\nAre there are people they're supporting Kevin\nThere are some I Would say a handful of\nOn one hand the not if you saw the worst in support of Kavanaugh from one\nPerson who actually describe yourself as an independent I talked to him in front of the Supreme Court he said he was there to to push back on this\nCircus like atmosphere those are his words a that surrounded the nomination of of cat and he's saying that the Democrats have brought it on themselves and that they they made a spectacle out of the nomination process\nThere was another gentleman I met a since he was a member of the n._r._a. and was really there\nTo show support for in our area but he said that he went to West Virginia and a couple of weeks wanting mentioned to do the right thing which in this case was to go to a vote a yes vote for half\nAn hour and we still don't know what I mentioned is going to do tomorrow in that final vote how far have people traveled to get to Washington\nSo we've met people from uh from Illinois we vet people from Denver ah we've met people from all

yesterday and ah they were trying to make sure that she was a no vote which she ended up doing in this cloture vote again it may be seeing which is going to do tomorrow\nWell just briefly for act in a lot of ah protesters have made their way into the capital to try to have their voices heard by senators are getting into elevators et cetera what kind of access or protesters getting inside the Capitol just briefly\nYes they're they're still getting in I have not been inside the Capitol today but they're not being impeded by by Capitol police to get in on this process is going to continue throughout the day and and you can probably see that happen tomorrow as well\nRight That's NPR's Brakkton Booker outside the capital back and thank you thank you well it's we continue to follow everything\nWith Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races\nAre in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series this week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHey how you doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to tell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else should we know about her\nOh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist she lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college\nShe was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen meeting Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jackie resident that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nCalling senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada is a no\nI'm telling you right now I suppose we should legislation to ensure the way from ... Americans who played hundreds of thousands but but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there but you're going to be hell or\nJust promise and voted for repeal deciding vote just or how\nHow big of an issue is that slip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have seemed to be making a quite a mark here\nAbout a year ago maybe a little bit more Heller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change the Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nNot just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue\nOr what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nI don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver not telling me what\nYou're going to you and just do it\nAgain and get things done forty pieces of legislation to help our veterans parties to pass a balanced plan\nDelivered to the actual name Heller is our voice our\nOur boys and\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking of that ad are women\nYeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen my fourteenth points over Heller fifty two to thirty eight percent that's a huge drop from the summer when ... was at about fifty percent with women\n[noise] what else do we know about ... other than the fact that he sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally\nYeah now that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote unreliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called Heller and and and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this\nUm that's what the hell are seem to change his vote and um they adolescence in turn have given to his campaign war chest\nIs adults in a huge player still in Nevada politics\nHuge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest man in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need him on your side in order to hold office there [noise] you know this this will be the ... election to see if that is the is the case\n[noise] ah any sense of how the cabinet or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada\n... said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a checkup it did explode across the social media landscape here um\nAnd and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking a direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Capitol hearing what\nWould you say is the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November\nThis election is I think it's not the heart and soul of Nevada I Do think President Trump will be on the minds of voters Democrats Republicans everything when they go to the polls because through his words his tweets his actions he has made politics about values\nW.

Utah even sending a head shot hoping to make a guest appearance [laughter] do you think it could have crossover appeal today or are they even making an effort no\n[laughter] in one word or you know I spoke to the show's creator and show runner Diane English in LA in July\nAnd basically she told me she didn't think there would be a show 'em there would be a revival uh if if Trump hadn't been elected president\nUm she was a how supportive of Hillary Clinton ran a pack um that was connected to her before the election had a huge party at our house ah\nAh for the election and had like two hundred bottles of champagne that she couldn't open when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how they affect the Trump has had on politics on media especially ah she's got this show that features these people were supposed to be top journalist\nSo of course pushing back against that has become one of the major themes in the revival of of Murphy Brown\nAnd because she's so close to Hillary Clinton of course she uh she got the former secretary of state to actually make an appearance on the show so we've got a clip of that or let's\nLet's let's check and I also assume you've had previous secretary ... for four years I was a secretary I was a secretary at a very large organization [noise]\nAnd you have all the requisite skills computer male female [noise]\nI I Do have some experience with it\nDo you wonder if you're running as something again I get out [laughter]\nNo I doubt it I don't think they would have brought up emails [laughter] at any rate um it ... you know Hillary Clinton has been having some fun she was she's also appeared in a an episode of a Madam Secretary that trauma\nUm alongside and Colin Powell and I'm I'm a ... and uh other political so I'm ... this show has been very much about pushing back against Trump ism the Murphy Brown revival\nAnd I'm In an in an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back against some of the things they do so this shows very much about pushing back against Trump ism and pushing back against the monitor shape but the GOP so it it is not a bipartisan\nThat the original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real life needs fiction moment during the Nineteen Ninety two presidential\nElection Quayle made of family values speech where he criticized the character Murphy Brown for having a child outside of marriage then the character Murphy round responded to wells criticisms in the show and now it seems like the show is trying to manufacture that same dynamic with President Trump\nYeah there there's a a there was a scene towards the end of the first episode of the revival where Trump was supposedly watching these fictional uh news characters on the air and tweeting about them and then they were reading the tweets and responding to him I think we have [noise]\nMurphy you hit me hit back in time harder oh you were\nWearing a hat on [noise]\nSo of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a delivered a very effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show\nI think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival I I didn't I found some of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned\nAnd in some of the speech fined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a diabetic\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like it kind of wish the show I'm ... these people making a kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweet at them\nA while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but um what's really happening is that there are so many people that had been saying things like this for so long on TV including most of the late night comedians that we have you know Stephen ... Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh Trevor Noah that it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary uh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world\nNow all of that has changed and I think his left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times\nWell what about the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bringing back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of stars and bars politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that\nUh fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows that are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver\nAnd all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slapped living near the show a over it so\nI'm a you know those have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon that will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show hadn't been in syndication for a long time so I you know I don't think a lot of younger people we're all familiar with the show and because the the the revised version of it\nUm it's still a little awkward and kind of old school I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\nNPR TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAny gang top story today the Senate advancing vet Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lied I cannot have prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct most had changed\nThat's NPR's Tovia Smith reports some say there's still a ways to go to many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra let's God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it in schools knew how bad it was in Nineteen Ninety to Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh went\nCentered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster Georgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents he vowed to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women John Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nThis has been a call to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't some gauge to him soul searching who's making a mistake\nSchools have already changed dramatically since the eighties toll free says driven by evolving attitudes and society at large stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent and respect\nIt is changing but it's still a problem on campuses and I certainly can't say that we are out of the woods yet\nThen did just three years ago saying all the school in D.C had to ... college yearbooks after discovering seniors at the elite all boys school had included crude and success slurs\nThat's way too recent this is very disturbing\nAttorney Eric Nick leash represents victims of sexual assault and it's also a saint ... alone\nRight now fifty seven degrees and Boston this WB you are [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Arab politics ... the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that\nYeah it was it was an interesting point that he made I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that\nAnd this has been set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington ... today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett cabinet will be confirmed for the Supreme Court and whether I'm taking responsibility for his actions\nBut of course keep in mind that when Frank and laughed we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place he's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans so on one hand he's criticizing it seemed ... Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand it's presented in opportunity for head ... the most fascinating\nBut how is the whole cabinet debate impacting of it is this race or is it just falling along party lines\n[noise] you know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this is something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Cavanaugh we support judge cabinet but what was sort of weird was that people said you know we believe that something bad", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Boston", "day": "05"}
