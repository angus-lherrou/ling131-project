B. U. R. don't forget whatever you pledge right now you're going to be entered into when this brand new twenty Nineteen Subaru provided by city side Subaru in Belmont and maybe\nYou know maybe you're like me and I always you know assume when I entered these kinds of sweepstakes for these kinds of conflicts and like there's no way I'm going to where there's no way but you know what someone is going to win and I tell you what we actually caught up\nWith one woman who won one year this is Carol ... she's the w._b. you our listeners and she and her husband they actually they got an email from Julie in our membership department letting her know that she had one car just like one that you could when when you pledge right now\nWe came home to a message on the machine and sort of looked at one another and set on this has got to be a scam [laughter]\nJulie it sent a matching email so then my checked and different things to be sure that she was telling us the truth ... gun in the forest or it was like oh this is at it this is a beautiful\nWe're regular donors to W. B. you are because we listen and we enjoyed the station so we just how many times do you make a donation that was one of the questions when max said to me\nTo do and did this contest and I had to admit I said I don't know because I was donating regularly not donating for the contest thanks to city side and you guys get the new guy [laughter] so that's\nCarol Dolores she's the one who won a a a Subaru courtesy of city side Subaru and she mentioned there that she she was a regular donors she wasn't donating for the contest and that's an important thing uh to know is that when you become a monthly sustaining member of WB you are which means you ... you sent us you\nKnow five dollars ten dollars Fifteen dollars a month you get entered in for every single sweepstakes that we when you could win something without even knowing about it and we have had\nSome amazing sweepstakes this this fund drive we've had\nTrips to China trips to the Galapagos island trip to Tuscany in Italy these are all amazing sweepstakes that we offered generally pretty regularly as part of these fundraisers and these are all things that you can win by becoming a sustaining member even more importantly you want to become a sustaining member right now because for the next four minutes\nYour money goes fifty percent farther once again one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or online that WVU are out of work\nThat's right the clock is ticking just a few minutes left to take advantage of this fifty percent match that we have from a generous group of listeners like you and we know that many of you were just like Carol who we just heard from you give any way you're not in it just for the thank you gift\nBut it is there is an opportunity and for others out there it's just that extra nudge the perhaps you need to get in off the sidelines perhaps you've been listening for many years you've been a long time\nFan of WB you are and you've been wondering is now the year for me to step up and open up my wallet even for a little bit and don't think that your ten dollars a month doesn't make a difference it absolutely does in any case and especially in the next couple of minutes when we have this fifty percent match let's take advantage of it uh W. B. Y. dot org or one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight\nYeah for the next four minutes or so your ten dollars a month becomes Fifteen dollars a month for the for the first year of your donation\nRemember we still have a lot of money that we need to raise as part of this fundraiser eight thousand dollars we're trying to raise this hour eight thousand dollars that we need in order to keep ourselves on pace towards what we need as ... said you know every little bit helps because that's really the beauty of the fundraising model we have here WB you are it's not one person calling in\nWith a five thousand dollar pledge if you can do that right now that'd be great because that would pretty much wipe out our entire coal for this hour but you know if you can just be a hundred\nMaybe ten Fifteen twenty dollars a month or whatever you can give every little bit really does make a difference when we're talking about the tens of thousands of people who have joined to support WB you are in the past you can do that right now my calling one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven are going online to W. B.\nU. R. dot at work I can remember what you are giving for the the funds that we get from you are listening community is what allows us to maintain our independence to go hard charging after the truth uncovering facts that others don't have time to spend because they're so concerned about the bottom line what you give us is that ability to be independent and\nTo take on not only the daily breaking news you hear every day on MORNING edition and all things considered and those conversations you hear in the middle of the day on our talk programs but also those long term projects press you've been listening to last seen our latest podcast out\nThere was more than a year and the ... and we're able to undertake those kinds of projects through your generosity and it missed final couple of minutes and this half hour you're able to make that dollar stretch even farther the fifty percent match up until the bottom of the hour at one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven\nWe're down to six thousand dollars now we need to raise my one o'clock six thousand dollars were almost halfway there with about half\nOf the hour left remember right now when you get give it's only about another two minutes or so right now your money goes fifty percent far this let's knock another thousand or two thousand or three thousand dollars right off that number right now WBRC here because people in the past have done\nTheir part said this is something that I Want to support that I Want to protect\nIts here for you because the people in the past doing that now it's your turn to do that for someone in the future so they can discovered WB why they can discover the great programming here one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight\nSeven but that's right no one is forced to give to NPR to W. B. or something people do voluntarily it's sort of an unusual business model if you think about it we give away the news for free\nEvery day and you're able to take advantage of that whether you give or not and yet you're only able to take advantage of it because of the generosity of others and some of you give individually regardless but we also have those generous underwriters and those communities your listeners that are giving even more to encourage people to get off whether it's suppose thank you gifts for the fifty\nNow's the time to do your part one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or online at W. B. U. R. dot org\nAnd it really does make a difference that we rely on the community for Ninety five plus percent of our funding it not only keeps us independent but it also maintains that perception\nOf independence remember you've probably heard if you follow the news\nPeople attack other news outlets for their ties to corporate owners and those attacks may be untrue sometimes but it's enough to plant a seed of doubt some folks mind and for you when you're listening to W. B. or an NPR you can do with total certainty\nThat we are independent of those kinds of influences and when you're having those conversations with your friends who may be even more skeptical of the news\nThan yourself you can point to what you hear on WB or as air and know that they also see that reputation for credibility whereas they may have questions about others and that is part of what you're giving to protect its that credibility that reputation for independence at W. B. Y. dot org or one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven\nI remember very early in my journalism career I had a an older journalist telling me he said the most important thing you have to do is avoid even the appearance of impropriety and all of your dealings everything that you do and I I think for the vast majority I Can't speak for everyone I can speak for myself you know\nBut I think here WB you are I think everyone subscribes to that idea and I think that's what makes WB you are\nAnd public radio in general a really special place to work in a really special source for news because we don't have\nAny kind of a you know outside influence on what we report to you it's I mean are outside influences you the public that's I mean it's right there in our name where public radio were by the public\nMeans we're also for the public but it also means that every now and then we have to come to you and ask you to do your part to help keep a strong independent and vibrant thirty nine hundred dollars now to raise my two o'clock we can definitely get their call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or go on line and W. B. U. R. dot org\nAnd we know that many of you would give regardless but we also want to say thank you and so when you call with a gift of even five dollars per month as our thank you give we'll give you a twenty five dollar gift card to Henry bears park\nClassic toy shop there's seven locations in greater Boston in one in Providence this is the place where your children can discover the joy of play at any age with toys games in books our thank you for giving to review our adjust the five dollar a month level\nRemember you'll be also entered into when that brand new Subaru from city side Subaru in Belmont thirty nine hundred dollars we need to raise now my two o'clock so let's raise it All right now one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or online at W. B. U. R. dot org\nWVU our supporters include the cabin in Beverly friday ten time Grammy winners and vocal hall of famers the Manhattan Transfer standards and their new release the junction tickets at the Cabot dot org\n[noise] it was a part about the last game that got me my nails ...\nSea Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter from her to alleged attackers they were having a good time she said\nAt my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to catch treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left and my friends now well over sixty pretty strong decried if that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline reported busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and ... heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers\nShe joined us from Chicago and welcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from the week prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago for say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the weeks prior and we're continuing to see an increase call volume right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing are we ... we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flashback you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely through a flashback is for a survivor\nOr re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey're right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this you heard of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pin down and I had another friend telling me just imagine regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe loves the Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIs the feeling of being choked of being\nOf being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when the experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we are going to fight\nWe're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and was lousy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about as well from the survivors that we work with we usually\nPeople have a flashback she's also explain dust that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presidency too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talked to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience was and so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that sort of ...\nOf the way the trauma is stored in the brain to literally re presents themselves and re experience that trauma an incredibly intense way\nWell some of us thought that she\nActually sounded Fifteen at times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to a what that was exactly like for her infant yes yes yeah look\nThe majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg\nAfter watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by him using executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know it was happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there don't remember when it was the place I don't remember how many years you know was what I don't know [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Boston", "day": "03"}
