the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this is\nThe presumption of innocence and fair that you know they're on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nThan for the next twenty minutes she walked through why she ultimately believed the charges against Kavanaugh should knocked prevent him from serving on the Supreme Court her conclusion\nMr President I Will vote chicken for judge Kavanaugh\nMinutes after that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would also support the nominee or we're going to bring in NPR's Kelsey Snell she is on Capitol Hill she has been tracking all of this back and forth today he kills either high so I Want to ask and just a second a little bit more about what senator Collins said but first just the headline\nIs there any suspense at this point how this confirmation fight is likely to shake out\nWell now that mansion has said that he remains I guess this is essentially they had the fifty one votes the fifty on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing could happen but now I'm not going to happen we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA role but he might have had to play how to how to not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins as she laid out her position and the links for speeches or you just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speech as a kind of closing argument did was as much that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically was saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called the gutter level political campaign instead of a fallen confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there while she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could watch her well she spoke and it was it was a it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew\nWhat was coming to me a little bit more about how she said she wrestled with the allegations of sexual assault\nYet she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward and ah Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault but she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through it and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was Kavanaugh's who did it\nAnd she's sticking to her belief and the presumption of innocence and she spoke about that quite a bit um and about the idea that this isn't a trial but that due process is still something she believes in\nSupport for NPR comes from WVU are from farmers insurance\nCommitted to helping people understand the

you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the rule judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Malcolm so these are not he said she quit she said questions there that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the ISI circuit court of appeals in our audience who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week was testifying\nThat is certainly true I think that there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him\nThat he would have acted like and what time is on I had\nBy the way he acted like in ...\nI think the response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interviewed well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim as a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice while I forward\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not base he leaves based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remark and he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that she found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes truly on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things they shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to centered ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and the ... gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats and you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the program [noise] you're\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers by the challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate\nI think it's a huge deal\nAnd houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from and players they can't find more hurry that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says those historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nAnd also of course has sent Connecticut implications for wages there\nAre signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down load people benefit of disproportionately goes bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment\nThat's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating so who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade\nFormer President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who is senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates should you know look I'm getting too low you have a problem with the PlayStation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally began raising rates gradually and has continued that pays under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people in the bed and many other economists they would start to slam on the brakes she'd be on a one way to get around five percent and they never would have allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWhere

clear how she was wanting to vote yet she basically used her speech as a kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically we're saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there while she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so

an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easy Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon ... this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with eight second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representatives for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van

something you can shape looking at the ... video of districts that act so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community well\nI think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there is another trial would lead it to the shooting\nThere are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald a preventive at night and there were reports and I think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community field but also that feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial and how she reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shot six soon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers unseen that night who encountered the comic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that was important to a lot of folks that fact of
