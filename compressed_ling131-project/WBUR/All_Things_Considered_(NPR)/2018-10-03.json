S. held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages in border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nHa just by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children\nThe government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all and then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children it anyway no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nSo have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nVHS does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...\nAre there any children who still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Jill you're walking [noise]\nRight now by the way the New Yorker we offer subscription a discount subscription\nIn a lot of our fundraisers but if you haven't been reading the New Yorker you know a what a monument is effect it's had on news of late so you'd be supporting us certainly if you make a call right now pledges support really for whatever gift you'd like to get\nOr even no gift at all one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to ... age seven\nThanks a lot of funding for WVU our weather reports\nComes from Charles River apparel home of the original new Englander rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three the wind and water footed rain jacket for all around you available and twenty color combinations including blue and white stripes gray on well read in the navy\nLearn more and located Charles River apparel retailer that Charles River apparel dot com [noise]\nFrom Boston University you're listening to Ninety point nine W.

B. U. R. dot O. R. G.\nHere protecting independent journalism with your pledge that is what you're doing you're making sure that this radio stations days independent that no one tells us what or how to cover the news [noise]\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of wind and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of taboos Missouri exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lead paint explain what you mean by that\n[noise] you know just just thinking about tropes in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can ever make\nWe do that with ... we do that with breast feeding all of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum\nOf gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women\nCan you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to this call them since it was published this week\n[laughter] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yup we've\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled\nI asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi well so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads\nWho are good dads\nThey're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone\nUm so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nIs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell her father's about this sort of have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time because of what we're hearing into the cabin up for hearings because their fathers have said something like\nI'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago\nAnd I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\n[noise] Monica ...
