S. government spends a lot of money repairing coastal communities after big storms Lisa song is a reporter for ProPublica and wrote about the high cost of beach re nourishment and how that money is divvied up welcome Lisa thanks for having me at least that can you tell me what beach nourishment means\nWell it's basically when the government comes in and they pump a lot of sand onto your beach to a fix the damage to the beaches that have occurred to erosion or through storm damage\nAnd the reason why a federal state and local governments will fund this is that without beach nourishment\nSome beaches in the U.S particularly on the east coast in the Gulf Coast are just getting smaller every year um they're retreating and so the people who own property on the beach obviously want the beach to stay where it is and those beaches are very important to the tourism economy\nHow much does all this cost and where's the money coming from\nIt costs a lot um so many of these projects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state a low the federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies the people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties\nSo these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect and which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis\nSome community is actually find most of this work themselves to the local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved", "show_name": "Marketplace", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "02"}
