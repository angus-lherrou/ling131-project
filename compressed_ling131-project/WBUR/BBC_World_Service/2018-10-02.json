woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just ask\nWhat was your breakfast I usually asked my patients delayed have you eaten you because she sometimes for gets herself she has ten kids and she had been even eaten you know the season is just feeding maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your ... when a female patient walks in one of the things you've taken into consideration and it comes to like to think that I think for\nMy last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because I got my education from Russia and now you spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling him what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came severely a leading in flood level was very extreme you didn't do in the condition in somebody we don't have blood bank so we have human ... so you need to call everyone who has the exact today that the blood and and draw divide so we\nSix seven hours looking at ... and ... and she's good to go out a number of ... you cannot have the children you have to do you have to do this given all this patient education and I'm leaving after four months she's coming back again bleeding okay so she had another miscarriage yet\nAnd that was so if you guys you know starting breach inherent you know you want to die you ought to do this and by the time I was walking away from her bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or for the children I just to get my second husband if I don't give him\nA child he will just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen and shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader start listening an approach my patient more holistically where they're coming from is not only being a physician who or training to what that turns for my clinical skill and wet broach\nI went to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you face take all the first ones off skew point about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and of course for a long because most treatments were designed for men not women point is that well\nScience has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals\nThere's a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women\nSo much of our science has been done on a male model\nAnd even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women and late face clinical trials you're still dealing with the issue of the science on which the clinical trials was based being based on a male model\nAnd can you give us an example of a disease that affects the two sexes different she\nSure let me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we\nSee and cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque or the hardening of those arteries in the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference\nSo if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked there are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology\nWomen are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to develop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something that's actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg\nBut the good news is that we are learning these things but we still have a very long way to go\nNow ... you were working in Somalia country that has seen almost two decades of civil war and up until recently there was no central governing authority [noise] one of the greatest Barry is to say just treatment for the woman and you'll catch everything you can imagine\nIs there because when you're done ...\nWhere you don't have lost to follow you know the\nBrutality happening to the woman his body and all the way they made to lead the way they don't allow him in ... surgeries\nBecause the man said so or because of there is a con deficient so if you're a woman and you're married from one client and you learn from other so you become an object of the\nRivalry between the two clients and they will not allow you to go your own house procedures to the woman oh effected by this plan rivalry\nDefinitely they affected in many levels but if things not improved with the new government [noise] not yet the whole health system is run by World Health organization the government is very poor did enough money to invest in healthcare\nStill everything the focus in its among tuition and infection where we'll neglecting did diabetes and chronic diseases so it's still difficult it's still hard and one thing that\nThe health care was improved for the last couple years it's\nI'm In school child spacing so that's the one area we got progress and we educate much mother is and we give the injection we have delivered all hospitals fee injection isn't and birth control pills so we're pushing on that site and I'm very proud to have those [laughter]\nPoint teasing translate you research into into biology how do you translate that when you're working in the type of environment that day covers describing\nYou're really thinking about whether or not only the disorders that diseases that affect women\nBut also what is the context of that disease\nSo for example if we were to start to think about lung disease\nIn certain areas for example in Africa and other places one of the main causes of pulmonary disease pneumonia but also chronic pulmonary disease or cook stoves you see what the end result is but how do you begin to understand and unravel\nNot only what is the cause of it but how do you change practice and practices so connected to culture and to use those structures within a culture to change behaviors and that's something that doesn't happen overnight\nDeclare anything to add to that you're right it's just cultural change and also development change you know government to test to change its not only hospitals and medications you just talked about the stove housing\nSanitation plumbing old that includes the hell have been a better environment it\nPrevents a lot of diseases\nOn the sports that making women's health the priorities are we talking about on the conversation today with Dr ... Johnson a cardiologist and women's health expert and Dr ... who together with a mother and sister when hospital in camp for many women and children who were displaced by ... in Somalia [noise]\nPutting your ideal he's in has healthcare cheese\nPie in the sky because in most health care context it's not practical to implement such a nuanced approach we're not\nTalking about adding additional resources on the front line\nAlthough sometimes that is necessary what we're talking about is an approach of looking at health and health care delivery through a gender lands using the best science but also the best understanding of how women are leading their lives I Would actually call that really good medicine\nAs opposed to something that we can't achieve\nThey could do you think that you deliver the haves and have health care absolutely the woman needs\nMore time more listening more comforting because of the word role of men and women change so she's not only the mother and caregiver her own children she's also bread winner in the house so she has so much stress\nYou're listening to Ninety point nine WB you are from Boston homo Boston's largest radio news Rome Ninety two points on WB your way to his Bertie learned point one WB UH Brewster and streaming of WB you our dog or W.

other businesses you say you're taking a long viewed away from us [noise]\nSo in this back and say you have potential to better also sitting along with us along with volunteers [noise] uh so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better they are not taking their business over his\nHis career my points to go ahead what we find there's obviously politicians of it is about saving the planet but it's also back saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day\nThey can't afford to take something along to a professional repair uh\nI'm guessing assessed than to be told to calm the retired\nSo what we do is we do at least the assessment for free and then maybe we say it is we're taking it to retire us so we take out some of the expense or on the person is going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC cafe down have those countries\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future do get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair she'd become cheaper and now for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor\nAnd labor is sex tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that labor or should be taxed lower so that's\nA professional repairs have become more attractive in in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business and um [noise]\nI don't know of course there will be different labor costs in different pulses of welfare so what you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet [noise] after listening to have\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work at just the costs were alone people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that as I found out when I paid a visit to a landfill thought the other day how about this one to the white water\nBecomes to protect today and I'm Talking some topics I made a half [noise]\nThrow this is the golden child was

during the time yeah\nOh yeah I've got whacked two kids that don't have to run and that's how people did right sometimes it's just not practical exactly\nWhat's in it for the cameras stuff from cameras stuff you know when you put on a lens and the\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately um Georgia or point where they\nCan't use because they got fungus in general things wrong with him so ... ... is that you could you right but there's not really much more than it was anything to take you to pieces and cleaning around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good that now and then put when it's just that\nIt comes down to the fact that that were in perfect working order about twenty quit or ... or something like that I was a real ... ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour legs and say we're going to put them in the world is is is Lois Lois has been no I've already been up for not looking good regard\nWe should really be doing things to reuse

generally cheaper nailed equipment and he just by the joke [noise]\nSouthern a couple of issues are raised the I Wonder you know ... people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but lawyers often gets in the way that she's busy I just don't have the time\nYeah obviously of people are pretty busy\nThe lady informed community of people around or whoever you conscious about this and vitamins that that saying bad movie get and sometimes we get ... just fun because people want to do that bitch in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they had actually being lord of the thoughts that things don't go to lunch and\nMust seem I Wonder if you could kind of address ... some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because now that already on board with the environmental movement without ...\nHow'd you get the other people have you ... the other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip you are quite happy just to throw stuff away\nWell that's the challenge of course but we hope to get them into the repack I say when they have something\nThat they really want to hang on to win that when it's a fresh is broken object that cannot be so easily replaced by the cheap you type and we know that that's what happens when people come to say they don't really expect\nThings to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind towards a more sustainable society\nPolitical running show some time now for the

of course campaigns ... animal testing\nThat trans phobia of fracking folks hunting nuclear issues plastic packaging the list goes on how does that relates to selling both products\nWill be trying not to relate it to something past presidents because all the things they she said you just mentioned the things that we will cap I'm passionately ... before we became a company that made\nSense we were all campaign as an activist before we came up to ... and that includes the people who started lash so obviously there's a whole host of things that we will care about and we built a business that suddenly became big enough that we could use our shop fronts on our website to actually talk about the\nThings that we were campaigning about in a private lives so for us that's a huge buying on those issues it's not marketing saying\nOkay so this is all just heartfelt stuff it's not anything to do your saying with the commercial end of the business know how's it affected the commercial end of the business\nWhich that will when he first started campaigning publicly that we would never judge a campaign by its sales figures that we would never look to chew up at the same time because it would make you hesitate to have to win again so that little fact and we largely stick to it\nAs everything else you right now how is it affects your say oh I can tell you deal with it because actually surprisingly put sales up\nSo when the campaign people came to you saying that sales were up this was during the spike ups campaign that was getting all the negative publicity\n[noise] uh yes yes during this microbes campaign and yet it wasn't a campaign speak but it was actually our accounts people came to us and you know made a phone call and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know and hang on in that\nIs that because any news is good news\nI think it's because then you need is good news out I Would hope that what it was was a customer standing by us that they were really literally holding hands through it and saying you know it's okay with you we know what you do we know why you do it and we're going to keep shopping with you know we don't care if you mess up and we don't care if you mess up sometimes\nI mean I I get what you're saying and I get the thing's a heartfelt and do you separate the two things I I suppose I'm slightly struggling to understand why you'd be bothered with even trying to sell soap or other products cosmetics if your campaigns are served as Britain have absolutely nothing to do with that I mean why marry the two in the first place\nI guess we marry the two because we've built this huge brand we're on high streets around the world and it would be homeless roots not to allow the people that are

talking on line to other people who care about them and exchanging information and I think they won bronze to be counted that\nWould you like the Nike I mean like Nike and you and what you'll do would you like to see other companies doing more this activist campaigning as as part of the brand promotion\nI'd like to see companies take a look at the world see what's wrong do something about it in the supply chains do something about it in the way they interact with the world as well as in the slick marketing I think it is more companies cat and actually you know ... to ... then a lot of us as
