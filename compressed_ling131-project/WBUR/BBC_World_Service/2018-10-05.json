if he was definitely have learning disabilities he may not know how to interact it's our job to be able to respond to situations\nIn a manner which creates the best possible outcome you can't look at that situation and saying this was the best possible outcome under the circumstances of that moment with what they had to work with there was the best possible outcome\n\nAlready this year right across the U.S at least a hundred and thirty people with a range of disabilities physical mental and intellectual a confirmed to have been killed by police officers in hundreds more cases it was never determine what's the person killed had a disability a tool\nBut what if the officers involved in taking the life of someone with a disability\nAnd brought her heart for nine hundred that\nThing in Oklahoma City we rode with sergeant ... as you went to patrol you reveal too was a moment Fifteen Years ago the changed his life\nI was involved in this critical event where I could just add a subjective is armed with a knife outside of school and um\nI was forced into a situation where I didn't have any other choice but to to shoot and kill the individual and we're outside of school

know that at the time I didn't understand what was going on at the time\nFor the time you you you felt you had no choice to to feel differently about that even\nNow I don't feel differently about it now\nOutside of that event outside of the pressure cooker outside of those milliseconds of the officer has to make a decision many people have the benefit of of looking back at that with ... minutes if not hours or ... days to contemplate whether they would have done\nAnd then they charge the officer because they didn't do the thing that I Would have done\nSo why does it happens so often with so many people with disabilities being killed by the police well firstly old police here are goes on and they face members of the public who want to the tourist sleep in places like Chicago's south side\nWhen we talk about police killings in America the biggest stories of the last couple of years the full surround is always the ... race riots just because we're talking about disability that doesn't mean the race over the falls flat how they do a lot of other cases we've looked that way people with disabilities having children interactions with it\nBecause of the highest police presence in those areas the highest essential for violence but also according to this issue\nFor a long time to choose a relief when they come into those areas [noise]\n\nSouth side Chicago is predominantly African American as challenges with inequality and crime\nAnd is one of the most heavily policed areas in the u._s. it's seen many instances where people with disabilities have died and interactions with offices the complaint from many that is the police too often command and control shouting commands and physically dominating\nEspecially when someone doesn't immediately comply\nAnd that can include the use of lethal force the problem is because we've already heard some people just can't comply\n[noise]\nKansas Coleman who has self has cerebral palsy works as a community organizer with

to the district attorney John Chisholm who'd ruled Adam did not die as a result the actions of the officers who teased him numerous times\nThey're not doing this because they wanted to harm Adam ... it's the exact opposite right there but it looked like it doesn't but it does their their their expressly tempt any number of times is that they were there to help them but they wanted to get him out

lakes and rivers is also the source of the clean hydro electricity that pile is no way but there's a paradox this country is still a major producer and exposure of oil and gas\nOn the real story this week we're debating Norway's energy future what\nA country that's grown rich and the proceeds of oil be prepared to make radical choices for the global environment and come this country's approach to the future provide a template for authors that said inside the wolves to be top panel\nAnd they are ... good medicine and pay for the conservative party here which is the largest policy in the

...\nI Do believe that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention\nWhat a a various political parties have done the wreck the several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in Norway and\nWe have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that the I Believe that we should be quite proud of who can't Goodman since I'd read last month\nCars were electrically and that's the crux of the major league towards a more green society especially when we know that the transportation sector is a big country be thrown into the field to credits yeah so for me I think it's very important that we have an active\nPolicy towards seeing getting new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives the money to do all the research on how\nWell the the green technology development\nGay Sunday so I think the because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better global and we do a big job abroad or we do a big joke inside no end up is because we have the money for more than ... to do to jokes\nWe do a lot of things in the rain forest numbers on those we do look with the electric cars you know what I Know there's a good thing\nThe ... from all the panel these green credentials their Christophe it's an ... are you going to agree\nCarry this this is not the view that shed by much of the new age in public that actually better that no way does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from no way we take it out cleaning from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries are in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on importing false ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the right person that's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you can sense should the Norwegian government be grunting new exploration licenses for it in places like the ... seats in the up to I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we actually sat and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seventh day twenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero\nZero Clemens got submissions can ...\nWell I think we have to see it on the great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounds based on cold\nIn the works but I don't know oh yeah we're talking about well yeah but my point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with\nUm when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worse agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do\nAll that stuff is in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the vibrancy because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the old sinuses they're out there\nI think it's very limited have long county or and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the tragedy we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... of when I was next sense and and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan\nTo get a full sized feels good sunny stuff\nWould look at the time frame because ... says well it could be draining on two twenty Seventy yeah you'd will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to\nMake shift without it and remember duck is based if we go to do a big big job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge\nHow do you want to just to mention also that we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you know it's not and and we'd be debating and those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built toughest new investments are being made into when you have all energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil team competition with the whole as a politician and in a country like no way would you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough does anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen they're such a moment and\nIt's become you see it but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you decide well because we have been producing country for so long and it seems to a large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that\nWe're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in morally feels for the future can convince\nIs kind of we have to look on what are our options what are the renewables for example\nWhere are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you have to do so well uh you get to a perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our Lance part of the ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf he wants to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers stuck to now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called a clean uno they changed their name it's part of the trust as they because they understand they're also part of the Grinch shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's start with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green is it a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or\nAt the same time we have to address CCS since his view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers do\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like ... regions big ... on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do and we can do because we are in the situation we're\nCarry you wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway ... effort political party actually agree on see if we let me just explain yeah this is what we mean by that cash a\nStory and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the seals in life you know we've been trying to develop that technology\nIn no way for for some time now\nAnd I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't no way are shifting government suspend quiet all of a lot of money to try to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and CCF has been focused on in Norway for Twenty years I think the also an to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think\nWhen we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if you're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less and they what you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC don't casual UK and you can subscribe to the podcast such the b._b._c. the real story you know pulled coughed up\nOf the b._b._c. World Service of us has made possible by the American public media producer a distributor of award winning public radio contest\nEight PM American public media with support from the three R O T addressing the world's most challenging problems that the convergence of artificial intelligence audio tea and elastic\nDrew our own the dogs are\n[noise]\nTo go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan with energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with that we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of bringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so there\nBecause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future and it just secure it is of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of towards ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which accounts\nFor other than oil actually had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan't government's fault no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion and the American sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made out there I\nKnow but it's ... it's it sounds like it doesn't say sometimes when I listen to skip because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them
