rows and rows of massive ten and\nThe United states government has sent Thirteen hundred kids they're so far and that number's expected to continue going up because we were dealing with a bottleneck right now where unaccompanied minors continue to come into the country but they're not being released as quickly as they used to be and so as a result we're just far over capacity in the shelters that\nBut typically hold those children and that's why the government is turning to the tent city in Texas\nThis term suitable for some of\n[noise] so it's comfortable from what I'm told but spare the

know at the end of the day they're soft sided what what are called soft sided structures are essentially large tents and so the prospect of living there for months on end for a young kid is pretty

you know\nMigration flows into the United states they fluctuate constantly\nBut in the last several years they more or less stayed at the same level ... have changed since President Trump came into office but what's different is that in the past unaccompanied minors were matched with sponsors that's usually family members or friends who've come forward once they come to the United states and agree to sponsor them and take them and take them home\nBut the Trump Administration has changed you know both policies and rhetoric in a way that have really intimidated people out of coming\nBecause they are afraid themselves of getting caught up in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement agenda because the vast majority of adults who sponsored these kids and take them in our

behind waking up in the middle night in ... giving them a whole lot of notices that the government doesn't want them to try to escape doesn't want to give them enough time to try to come up with an

be clear it would be good to be tempted facilitators the boxes to school to the boxes to come play we'll start life like for them\nThey can play but they do not have access to schooling so kids at the

La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be combat\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThough that impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs an gr off tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fired up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks early night among annual average is the ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages Bernie parts of the climate story ... ... the ... the masses to us\nOften we take a narrow view and I say we sort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect\nIncrease in that has huge ramifications for global sea level rise from melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the average is because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes in so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time honored television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind after all those happen every yeah\nOf course you know All right let me think what is not necessarily a hunting or what to come which is the reason why I mean do you attribute any of them are and I think this summer and it's\nTo say this is something different than you still quite rare and is now a relatively common and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here words of heat to heat waves\nThe atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nYou're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is defective climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger in apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks they also put another high over Siberia with high heat that and over North America\nWhere the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says mark ...\nCalifornia it's getting warmer and warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um is getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress um the summer droughts\nAre so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential\nFor worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season a California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have\nA perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California only this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out\nSo California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already\nPosing to us\nThan I Do I have ... the largest fire forty fingers in the size of Los Angeles [noise]\nThese are the conditions\nLived and experience fine then yeah queen David some fire experts at the University of California\nCompounded the tree stressing effects of long term child was enough rain in northern California last winter to stimulate a surge of bras gross to add an abundance of dry on the gross which fueled firestorm\nIn some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent\nOf normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking you know this just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem\nAnd so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and buffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising Harris and my husband actually went over and worked on that\nThey were all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California we've had it you know the last ten years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every year every other year but the Carr Fire felt different\nBecause ... affecting a major residential term walls in itself terrifying but the big one was the fire in the Mendocino hills actually a pair of funds that started on July the twenty seventh ... only finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning nearer to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California\nIt was during the height of the summer said the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing through those areas is\nJust all the right conditions for fast fire spread and extreme fire behavior and so the fires grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in at twenty four hour period or were more maybe\nThe the rate of growth made it very difficult for cruised to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that the next big it was last year in Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres so\nA very large area\nOf course it's not just being heat rice and fires well\nCalifornia bunt in camera Sanford and yet they have the worst monsoon fighting in a

undoubtedly\nYou said it was it create that ... in this country that British democracy and its role in the world\nAnd not be taken for granted it means to be invented let's look at look at the the bad side this gives the people who have Britain and the port unity do what they consider their position in the world and I believe that the judge me has been doing a very good job\nOr a recognizing that the last ... years of privatization of moving towards a business model that effectively tied the economy's growth on two bottles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's closing the assessment of they even with that or is\nInteresting and so you would say because you talked about last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of near liberal economic ... you would say the Tony Blair was in no way are left of center politician would you\nWhat does it mean on the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money to the national health service money that they thought he said stop the national health service off but at the very same time\nHe did it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye to the private money man thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances that lead to less than an eight and to the collapse into housing\nI'm not done all the the the current shadow chancellor of the sticker here in the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example the man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. ever need to have\nTen percent of ... given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of dividends to be received by each worker and the access beyond that would go to the government so it actually is a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the states and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote for that\nI think so and I'm very glad to have hut or John Macdonald put forward there have been proposing angle so McDonnell about the program we eras things you've been saying society proposing precisely that\nWith one difference I've been proposing the creation of a social but fund where the ten percent of the ... says I'll say every ... or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund\nAnd then the dividends are distributed to the former universal basic didn't\nWhereas the Labour Party is leaving them up amongst the workers within those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is not even need the money factor yet this is part of the Labour Party conference it may go into the manufacturers hope it does if he's a very interesting discussions are that we must have even thought it must have\nAbout the division between competed and labor but it differently statement once upon a time when and that sort of both the machine the machine lumped industrialist and then the investors who claimed that profits of the machine produced for the company but these days of Google and Facebook\nWhen every time you such and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital to Google and no one is getting a defense for that except for Google we have to reconsider that property rights over the dance of capital and live that everybody is the only party in the world that he's doing these okay\nSo for you definitely UK labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually in the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls your ideas are not gaining very much traction if we leave aside the United kingdom so I disagree with you is\nIs there any way I look at some point say to yourself you know what democratic politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP ... and she said recently and there's no such that we need to topple the government if we can't do it at the ballot box we will do it with a general strike by working with the trade unions is that your kind of full\nOf what's actually assigned has nothing to go to the last time I checked illegal immigrants and he's right now that your view on when you're all kinds of politics needs to go\n... ... let's be very clear to because these are dangerous times with their eyes of extremists around the world and we have to be very clear in our language and the the way that we support democracy\nSo to answer that gay I'm going to quote from with some church for\nThe Democratic process is pretty awful it's pretty nasty but it's the best of all of a sudden there's and we have to be prepared to defend it with our lives I think that this would be the faithful would answer to your question now where the strikes are part of the political democratic

as well as success stories in China\nYeah tell me Dan was to become an ecological zero sort of emission poster child but it didn't really succeed\nAre there are many reasons behind it but a shoreline this case just keep in mind that we didn't the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned business is\nTo this new area so it's a little bit different from the other big new projects in China this one is really read top down\nBecause he ... and the ... report came out a year ago nobody seemed to be happening just then since those days are the government has issued more plants ... prove this does seem to remains slow the\n... city planner for showing a new district uh he he ... he's the city planning gee he said that they will range of environmental problems in the area including a high flooding risk and poor access to transportation this is what he said in the speech\nIf these two problems and not to be solved it will be like building a ... no rubbish tip you meet the ... the government brought up for this new town\nWell Gabriel will ... is the Shanghai bureau chief for the Financial Times he went to the site recently this is what he so\nIt's definitely still early days for this mega project I visited when they were just completing the centerpiece of the first day the film on public service Centre and that is a kind of mini city within it maybe that include electric cars charging stations and\nSensors are based on than recognition twenty thousand sensors around the whole city is a future hotel that would include human being free checking they planted thousands of trees around the dancer but beyond that a public servant center is still quite\nA quite barren with basically still be able to read an almond trees surrounding the central service center\nWell George magnets is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans\nBasically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects and it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand they actually use the financial crisis in the west\nStarted to send ripples through China um and uh it was actually a time when the Chinese economy itself was actually go for a little bit of its own kind of tipping point\nSo really what's happening in the last ten years in particular I say\nThat the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so every time they called him he looks like it's looking a little bit worldly I'm you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments\nAre on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about a ... and leads to you know better growth that you see huge contentious issue because some of us believe actually the sequencing works the other way round that actually you get better urbanized ... from having good growth model\nCars actually if it was a simple than every what you need for groceries just build big cities\nPlus of course as a ... a declining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever and it wasn't always give you the same time that it did it the ...\nYes indeed and I think again you know like so many things in China and everything is so new on so if you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure ahead of population of course it's still some way behind Japan\nA soul in in Asia or you know American cities in European cities but um you know as ... that kind of famous British economist once said in the long run we're all dead\nAnd what we have to be concerned about really is about the missile allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks coast cities and I'm actually quite a lot of problem\nAnd it can also leader goals to huge amounts of public debt ... how big is Chinese public debt well\nUh it is about ... at the end of two thousand Seventeen was around three hundred and fifty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nThat sounds like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat where the the there is any magical number at which point you know a crisis ensues but certainly the the miss allocation of resources\nThe cumulative increase its difficulties which smaller Chinese banks are facing um funding that loads of what they have to raise deposits and\nIf they can't raise them from households they are raising them from increasingly a new voter tall and uncertain short term sources and I think these things are contrived to to bring about kind of some uncertainty now\nYou've written a book called red flags I mean how much jeopardy is China or in from ... and other risks\nWell I think I'm trying to doctors and the only problem joined the faces that it's also facing you know kind of a confluence of lots of problems aging\nAnd you know technology um currency stability and so on the difference that I think uh the last few years of made is that Xi Jinping's governance system has changed China\nI mean now I'm not clear whether you know intensely autocratic society with top down guidance and control is the most efficient\nThat's it that's all we have time for Joe ...
