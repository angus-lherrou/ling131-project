break the law\nAre we talking about the emergency broadcast system every so often old American radio and TV channels sound a squawking great ching a lump to test the system which in theory would be used with us every one to a threat to\nOversee we don't want to cause any alone by playing the alarm so we're just going to talk about the ... there's a new addition to a to keep up with the times a text message or let a fourteen twenty later today everyone\nAnd we mean literally everyone is going to receive a presidential election it's a text from the president and it's the first test of the latest debate of\nThe emergency alert system you cannot opt out of the moves however since voted by everyone that there were some interesting issues behind this and history as well and\nWe got it from Andrew for she needs a who is with Harvard Kennedy School bell ...\nThe alert system has been around for about fifty five years as a way for the president to quickly send a short message to the nation and the case of pretty much only sudden nuclear attack where there was not a lot of time to furnish that message\nUm that message was always going to be carried on radio and television and the most Americans will probably recognize the shrill attention tone that it broadcast or from the regular tested it had been going on right sought tomorrow's different because tomorrow will be the first time a system that was built over the last few years to allow it broadcast\nOr directly to cell phones is being used\nIt's interesting because cell phone's been around for a while because if the government is catching up a little bit late\nRight this was actually a implemented as a couple of years ago during the Obama administration as a way to say the civil defense status that is the emergency alert system\nOr needs to be modernized and now that we have this new phenomenon which is to say everyone in America more or less has a cell phone on their person um wouldn't it be nice to be able to reach them immediately\nOld television and radio channels would come together and we'll broadcast from wherever the prison walls or do a a sort of a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC requirements um the Federal Communications commission\nOr in the U.S that you had to participate if you are public broadcast or a private broadcaster for that matter ... so if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region\nYou would be um made to carry a message or the or more just see it where it would go off and they would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information stay on this channel\n... and they would they would do tests so Americans with ... with the sound but there would be told that this is a test of the system of the of the emergency broadcast system\nYes there was a required a monthly test and some places the weekly tests as well but often you know it was a midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when they snoozing on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nThat sounds like a cultural thing this is a Trump to learn the Americans know the left side of America wouldn't know that is that's a great detail I Love that [noise] so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness where people are realizing that this is something that's going to happen this is coming straight to everybody and I think the part that's really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump I'm not wouldn't be confusing would ditch [noise]\nUh no I think at some point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think having that happen right the first one is that is legal they did set this up to say\nThere is a way to you this is only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically would be illegal now a lot of people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down to legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal as the country\nUm but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House in in Trump's authority only but\nThe procedures would be handled by Shima so the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least I don't think that it would be like his Twitter account where he had on constrained access at any time\nRight so it is slightly filtered by the emergency management I'm a people and presumably Yukon reply to this text right\nTook control of the system though and sent some message either in farce or in you know the port city to the entire country in the wrong moment right that that would be a a worse situation almost than having a real message come through a at an untimely time\nYeah reply old would lead to trouble with ... or ... or of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School or just to spoil your anticipation that message are we going to get says this\nThis is a test of the national while this emergency alert system no action is needed but coming from the you know are we going to get all caps luck for example well this is this is the thing I'm I'm ah in fact will want to enter and other people are\nInterested eight and is the kind of the fact that many people who have a policy Xanax due to the current ... of the White House will just kind of go I don't want to miss the president's going to ignore it\nEven when it could be quite important and likewise if somebody else we're in the White House\nThe other half of America would possibly avoid it as well\nAs he was saying um it just feels as the president count really send a personal message or the bear in mind that these false alarms do actually have to remember Hawaii that there was a there was a a a false alarm of a ballistic missile attack which went home for thirty minutes before the pug was actually pulled the noise by the way
