snap on your smartphone if you're listening there don't delay on just do it now\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross let's get back to my interview a journalist Michael ... author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adapted into films and the undoing project\nHis new book the fifth risk looks at the federal government under President Trump it seems to me are you in your book you're basically saying you could predict similar problems that the federal government was going to have under President Trump by looking at the transition\n'em and looking at the ... candidacy so let's let's go to there the first chapter is about the transition before Trump wasn't even elected because the transition process is supposed to start with each candidate each candidate is supposed to be preparing\nAt some point as if they were going to become president so that their briefed and they're up to speed if they do become president so the first sentence in your book is Christina Chris Christie noticed at peace in the New York times that's how it all started what was the article Christie notice and what did this article start\nSo there was a piece in the times to describe the meeting that occurred between the Obama administration\nAnd all of the remaining presidential campaign so it was Hillary Clinton's campaign Trump's campaign this was still the before the Republican primary was over there were four or five of the campaigns and had set representatives and the reason is that happening was\nBy law the outgoing administration is required to prepare for the transition and by law anybody who's likely to get elected\nThe candidates are the two major parties are required to prepare to receive the the briefings\nAnd Christie saw this and he saw that the person that Trump's campaign said nothing about government and so we called Corey Lewandowski was running the campaign said look I'll go do it if no one else will because we really need someone someone who understands government to get involved\nIt surprised me that after learning that the Trump Administration had nobody who could fill this role in didn't seem to care very much about filling this role that Christie ... cello and supportive Trump and wanted to run their transition\nI think there are a couple of things going on at once one is as Christian makes quite clear but as other people have pointed out\nTrump didn't run to when he he didn't have an acceptance speech on the on the ... election he was running for as an exercise in brand building\nAnd so his whole attitude towards preparing to be president was why bother\nAnd when people told him he had to spend money either his money or campaign money to build a transition team he'd become furious and when you heard it was millions of dollars you'd scream at one point he said the Christie you know if we win you and I can leave the victory party two hours early and figure out everything we need to figure out about the government\nSo that they were both are smart yeah well that's if that's right so this is another theme that underlies all of this and that in the Trump operation\nThe presence of rich people Trump and especially in Jared Kushner there's this sense that\nThey both think that because they're rich they must be smart but the combination not way to spend the money not actually thinking he's gonna win and not being really interested in the subject at all leads Trump's to neglect the transition effort\nBut this is where it is curious Christie does wrangle a few million raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law any bills actually\nI think are quite good transition they had hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments and received the government for their ... the Obama administration is so the bottom and Mr Asian has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books that have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins and it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems so you understood so this is how we dealt with the Zika virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic\nHere's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it and an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems this is what this department does\n... this is how you do it and Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election\nSo we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings why did he fire them", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)",
