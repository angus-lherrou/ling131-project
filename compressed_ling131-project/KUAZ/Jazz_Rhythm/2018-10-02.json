things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people

the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern in the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about so the department of energy could just as easily be called the department\nOf nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested\nBuddy who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about so\nDepartment of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nIn one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside the department but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from ... didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside of the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good\nShe didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside of the department commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and the downside to know\nThis from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think that's like a big theme and his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal I Do with their conscious is easier to do because they\nHelps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing\nBecause you can just focus on the short term

first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who made a career out of those are people who really know really know the jobs\nAnd the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day [noise]\nAh so those are people who made a career out of ... people who really know

being here\nThanks for having me run down and what this law is and who will be affected by it\nSo California Governor Jerry Brown just signed into law a bill that lawmakers there have been trying to get through for a long time to actually require companies that have their principal offices in California do you have\nWhat we'll start with at least one female director on their board\nDid most sports include women already I mean how how unusual is it either to have women\nJerry Brown just signed into law a bill that lawmakers there have been trying to get through for a long time to actually require companies that have their principal offices in California do you have\nWhat we'll start with at least one female director on their board\nDid most boards includes women already I mean how how unusual is it either to have women on boards or not have women ...\nParticularly large companies most have a woman on the board large publicly traded companies\nBut uh their numbers show that about twenty five percent of companies headquartered publicly traded headquartered\nCompanies in California do not have any women and so they're trying to fix that issue through having a mandate of sorts it will grow over time over the next couple of years they're going to add to it where it's not just one that you were required to have that depending on the side the board they want you to have\nOne two or three and really most companies are probably going to need to have three\nThat are headquartered in California\nWhat happens if your company headquartered in California but say your incorporated somewhere else does this still apply\nFor the question here said they have put through this bill but there are both business groups in California\nIt will grow over time over the next couple of years they're going to add to it where it's not just one that you were required to have that depending on the five before they want you to have one two or three and really most companies are probably going to need to have three that are headquartered in California\nWhat happens if your company is headquartered in California but say your incorporated somewhere else does this still apply\nBut the big question here I said they have put through this bill but there are both business curtain California some corporate governance experts including a former members of the FCC has said you know what\nThis

in corporate governance\nWell I have seen the same question of whether he is trying to make a statement particularly this week although this was the deadline to end up September for deciding to find it into law so what was this a way of making a statement of of what the country has been engaged in a major national conversation about yeah I'm\nThe issue of whether having more women on the board has any impact is is a good question there is a lot of research that shows it does have a good impact but it leads to either higher returns or better decision making are better price mergers yet\nThe question is how do you do it do you actually require them to do it\nAnd I know of what the country has been engage in a major national conversation about yeah I'm\nThe issue of whether having more
