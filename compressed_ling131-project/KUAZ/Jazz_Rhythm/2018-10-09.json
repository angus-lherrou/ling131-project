media\nBut how good an in house a cue or is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when illumination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy\nA breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would jus really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know a change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as real as\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label\nPeople uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas I'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes\nLike that happen yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate there are some troubling\nWith more photos of people of color yes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple\nIf you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question so easily win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse\nWhether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception

the trust crisis that it has this is really smart I mean this is a device that lets people have these really direct personal connections are\nThey in fact more private than posting on Facebook and you could imagine if you were part of a Facebook group like a book group right or a little family group\nThat you could have a really nice video chat together uh and then you have so many connections on Facebook that the idea to be able to easily connect with them and do this video chat would be great we're still waiting for this in some ways\nI'm ... and actually and this is surprising it has a

you could have a really nice video chat together uh and then you have so many connections on Facebook that the idea to be able to easily connect with them and do this video chat would be great we're still waiting for this in some ways\nUm and actually and this is surprising it has a little more built in privacy then let's say an Amazon Echo you can turn off it off the camera and microphone\nFacebook says this totally ... cuts that connection to the mother ship and it's worth noting Bloomberg pointed out that when Amazon announced over Seventy new devices and services last month it didn't mention privacy once\nOkay yes and point taking it however comma this is Facebook and we are in a world where Facebook has the trust gross is that it has right\nI have been operating a very informal survey I don't know ironically Facebook I'm trying to go ahead I'm Ninety eight percent of respondents would not buy this in more like fifty fifty for Google Home [laughter] and uh and Amazon Echo\nIt's really surprising announcement to make for example right after a hack right after announcing that fifty million accounts right compromise\nAnd a Pew Research center survey from before\nDetroit gross is that it has right\nI have been operating a very informal survey on ironically Facebook eye to eye on 'em [noise] Ninety eight percent of respondents would not buy this in more like fifty fifty for Google Home [laughter] and uh and Amazon Echo [noise]\nIt's a really surprising announcement to make for example right after a hack right after announcing that fifty million and ...\nAnd a few Research Center survey from before that hack news said Seventy four percent of people were reducing their use or deleting the baseball cap or changing their privacy settings I mean you have to trust a company a lot before you let it put a camera in your house\nAnd it's a very confident assertion by Facebook I think that that maybe people are worried about their privacy at all\nWe're which may well be the case right as we have talked about let me ask you a different but related question it's kind of business model and it goes like this hardware is not Facebook's core competency\nI mean separated from all of that I think it is very interesting that Facebook wants to get into the hardware business it is tricky there are low margins it it's hard to get right you add a whole customer service layer that didn't exist before you know Google and Amazon both\nWe're which may well be the case right as we have talked about let me ask you a different but related question it's kind of business model issue and it goes like this hardware is not Facebook's core competency yeah I mean", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jazz Rhythm", "city": "Tucson", "day": "09"}
