malfunction\nMade an emergency dissent back to earth and they're happy to report both are doing well both landing safely Rachel Feltman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and other selected subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe thanks for having me Ira\nAnything more about what went wrong there\nSo we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure and they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing a ballistic descent which is so called because\nUsually they add make kind of a [noise] a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rock literally coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because uh they were supposed to come back down to the ground in the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing\nGo as they come down to create a little bit of lift and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rocket is really coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because uh they were supposed to come back down to the ground in the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agencies that immediately they would begin investigating and uh so far that that's all we know\nWell the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right\nAnd again this is a rare but the kind of things that astronauts train for all the time it's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so\nYou know not something we want to have happened but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWell what what what what's their Soyuz capsule being the only way for humans to reach the international space station is ...\nYou know a little bit of a problem is no other way to get up there right so there are um I Believe three so use mission\nOnly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happened but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWhere ... ... but with the Soyuz capsule being the only way for humans to reach the international space station is ... you know a little bit of a problem is no other way to get up there right so there are um\nBelieve three so use missions\nPlanned that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian space agency again is undertaking this investigation\nAnd so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not uh you know those two crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on I assess a minute there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know we have three people on the space station right now\nA gap in staffing you know we have three people on the space station right now but they're scheduled to come back in December now they could extend their stay a bit but the Soviets capsule they have up there that's going to bring them home I Believe it's only a it can only stay up there through some time in January so\nStarting at

radial\nA three year old NPR Boyd one\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nIs less than a month until the mid term elections on November ... and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated yet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems\nHow does all of this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security

what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\nLife to be here and it's nice to have you um Larry I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire early what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um a lot of conversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election in ...\nAnd is hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians are where the hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think um\nAgain not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that have the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm\nLooking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off [noise] is that what you're talking about in that case or is it something different\nKnow know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems might actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them\nI'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and a deal with registration databases\nOr electronic publics or what you kind of what our use their off in a uh\nNo no what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not they're they're certainly wasn't an attempt to hack them\nI'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and deal with registration databases\nUm electronic pull books or what you kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or art or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that there were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome dinner and it sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine compromise [noise]\nUm [noise] um well that's actually quite a controversial question ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped\nUm I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromise well I'm\nA well that's actually quite a controversy or questioned him ... you mentioned\nUm well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan scan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners that acts\nYou alluded to at the Twenty one states um they got attacked there was a voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan scan paper ballots and if we're thinking about the voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you\nMade a reference to the DEF CON um activities\nAnd so what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly um that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be ...\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines\nUm require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them\nUm and you need some sort of inside job um that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nOur they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is\nSo um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier to actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nOur they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go\nWith one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election\nI mean they're in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election\nAre using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election being there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing\nThat um there were mistakes made but a skeptic\nCan I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there were mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking\nThat the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I could just jump in real quick point um I I I I I think there to to build on what Charles just said uh I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument\nFor you to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see it DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I if I could just jump in real ... point um I I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and it's an example of that my an obvious example was election I reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states\nOr that I Know of but in other countries ... election reporting attacked um and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is um a lot of false\nAnd that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh we we have

Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future have catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages in and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement to ask\nAgreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages in and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point\nThe agreement ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius\nBut how much does happen to Greece save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is that to Kelly the vendors she is senior associate with the world resources\nA number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly the Vin she is senior associate with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much that can be with you\nWant to send out a shout out to our listeners and with this question as we barrel Tour de one and a half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to for eight to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at ... fry 'em so back to live in the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells is\nThat even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right said that and pass the government actually has these two goals as he said to limit warming ...\nTwo four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five you can also tweet us at science friday a show Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to degree increase in average global temperatures but this report till this\nBut even a one point five degree increase is going to bring some pretty big change [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius\nAnd they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and in the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd good for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found for example for extreme heat\nOne point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track on and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference and for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found\nA for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer um when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point\nWhen you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic or this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have\nA dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses um two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is\nAlmost forty percent worse uh under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent ah which is just tremendous\nKnow does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the back to orange or a degree\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible\nThere have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide

down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and\nHave to happen um to make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent they're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that

tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing

decision\nOn requested the PCC the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nUm had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent

policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea um\nAbout a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n... ... a lot of

was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in so off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season\nBut the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them and I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow I'm a big show how many do you study how many of the group a number of your study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nAnd do do do they each have each personalities of the room and you get your name\nWhy now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging

to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSome squirm one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life\nOf a squirrel monkey [noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh the\nI'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree\nAnd uh they spent a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nAh they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and\nIs about ten minutes [laughter] um and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven ...\nFor their practice yeah or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd a with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp ... the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes\nAnd they seem very happy while they're doing it wow\n[laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a while I'll watch tennis right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I've actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a a particular species and um they\nSometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a ... [noise] wait why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low\nAnd once the adult lost desert the ... the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] those once we're not leaving so right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nI ... I said spider monkey everybody does\nThey're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] those wipes for not leaving self ... right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nI ... I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah yeah okay tell us what we're listening to\n[noise] okay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I can recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver yeah um but when there's you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\n... we have another clip that sounds a little bit more how shall I put it\nFrom you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I can recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's so sad that we hear is that rises this usually this is those a squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nMight it might be birds actually because\nIn the wild um my guess is that there's an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's the sad that we hear is that right there there's usually this is those a squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because we're monkey sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of\nBird how hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference and to study this sounds to me\nIt's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and knows everything about square monkey then so\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and he knows everything about square monkeys and so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys and how long have you been doing it for a little longer he started with with a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well do you call him a yes sometimes he does he like he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language or evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nYeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in\nWe can learn about human language or evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nYeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the

and so manual grooming sort of the the kind we seen bad dunes andme attacks\nBecame less less feasible really and so the idea that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal

know I just I just said it but but salmon live impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys take\nThat is pretty impressive and their journeys can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds ...\nAnd and they usually hedging these are these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate up steam may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this they they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThe ... same and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journeys in wages they use\nThat's correct and they

array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they\nGenerally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\n... now I Know that your research is looking at a different group of them be lapped exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals\nThat were transferred from a landlocked lake\nIn Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\n... and ... and yet you found that they still have these Jew magnetic\nSam and that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake in Maine\nTo a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of the hatchery\nAnd yet you round but they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they not been ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different\nComponents one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as my dad field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the pole\nAnd so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as magnetic field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect\nOf the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the pools and shallower at the equator\nAnd both of these components predict are favorably are predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nThey're the mechanisms behind magna Utah reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that a salmon and other species have tiny chains of magnets\nAnd so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nSo they're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species have tiny chains of magnet tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic properties\nAnd so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields and so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nThough these structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm now why why is it important to you why do why does it matter that they can still detect these\nIt's a rather interesting question that we wanted to know whether landlocked\nAction potentials so these structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm and why why it important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked members of species that\nCould go to the ocean retain a map sense just to point of curiosity\nAnd we also wanted to know um\nIf it Lennox salmon also possesses ability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse ... amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon\nBut we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect a magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you touch copper wires to an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school them if I take a magnetized object and put it in\nThe magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nIs a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school them if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nSo we are present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains\nOf NATO tight right that somehow connect within ourselves right and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye

event by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nThat's terrific and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is the question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale of the night ...\n... so what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these [noise]\nDo do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future
