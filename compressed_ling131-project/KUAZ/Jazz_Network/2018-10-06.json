P. L. but we were among the very pioneers in that what is your role on the James Webb I Am the sort of coal PI science team leader for the mid infrared instrument\nIs the ... that looks at the longest wavelengths the most of the all the other instruments work in the region from visible to about ten times visible wavelengths\nAnd they actually are all centered on looking at stars they want to they just want to look at stars at such high red shift so early in the universe that their life has been shifted into those wavelengths region so the ... for an instrument that I'm at the science team lead on\nIs the one instrument is going to look at the fundamentally a nonstarter sources planets stars imbedded in dust\nGalaxies with a huge miles of star formation in them most of the ... of an ... an energy of which comes out with dust active nuclei from black holes and so on\nThe universe that their life has been shifted into those wavelengths regions ... admitted for it instrument that I'm ... the science team lead on is the one is tremendous gonna look out the fundamental ... our sources planets stars embedded in dust\nGalaxies with a huge ... star formation and them most ... ... ... energy of which comes out ... dust ... nuclei from black holes and so on\nTell me a little bit about what the biggest challenges ... the James Webb space telescope are\nWell the biggest challenges we wanted a telescope that was too big too big because it won't fit within a rocket fair and so there's no way to launch the telescope without having a fold up so the whole telescopes ask the shrink down ...\nGet in the rocket get in space and then unfold and wind itself up to make good images and space using the images of stars to guide how you move the segments and the telescope the marriage ... many different pieces get those segments wind up to make a good image\nThere was another challenge which is as an infrared telescope so it has to be cold\nYou said that ... and infrared telescope has to be cold how cold does it have to be\nRocket get in space and then unfold and wind itself up to make good images in space using the images of stars to guide how you move the segments and the telescope the marriage made of many different pieces get those segments wind up to make a good image\nThere's another challenge which is as an infrared telescope so it has to be cold you said that are in infrared telescope has to be cold how cold does it have to be\nWell this telescope itself is forty degrees Celsius above absolute zero recall it forty degrees Kelvin in Fahrenheit that's like sixty degrees above absolute zero so it's like minus four hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nAbsolute zero is the lowest temperature you can get to temperature is new to the vibration of molecules in absolute zero is one that stops\nThe telescope gets there by just radiating energy into space\nThere's no actual mechanical cooler that cools down but spaces even colder and so if you just build and right you can lose the energy to space and yet poll the only exception being the instrument that I'm involved in which has to have a cooler to get down to just about six degrees above\n... knew the vibration of molecules and ... when that stops\nThe telescope gets there by just radiate energy into space\nThere's no actual mechanical cooler that cools down but spaces even colder and so if you just build and right you can lose the energy to space and yet poll the only exception being the instrument that I'm involved in which has to have a cooler to get down to just about six degrees above absolute zero\nDoes this mean that the telescope has to have big sun shades to keep the sun off the back end of it the sun shade as as big as a tennis\nCourt and it has many different layers has proved to be one of the big challenges because we can't launch it either it has to be all folded up and it has to sort of on for like a window blind when you get ... and space and that's proven to be a really big engineering challenge\nThe particular kind of light that you're looking at the mid infrared why is it that you are so interested in that\n... infrared lets you look at for example ... planets around other stars or asteroid belts around other stars so it's part of the big push in astronomy to find other planetary systems is also it turns out most of the energy of very distant galaxy\nIn space and that's proven to be a really big engineering challenge the particular kind of light that you're looking at the mid infrared why is it that you are so interested in that\nSo Mitt infrared lets you look at for example planets around other stars or asteroid belts around other stars so it's part of the big push in astronomy to find other planetary systems\nIs also it turns out most of the energy of very distant galaxies that are still forming comes out in the infrared so if you want to study them this is where you have to lower costs lots of other things I could go on until midnight so maybe I'll stop here\nAnd why do you have to have the mid infrared portion of the telescope colder than the rest\nEverything radiates in the infrared and that the cold or it is\nThe longer the wavelength that it radiates out so we want to cool the telescope down so the radiation of the telescope is longer and lower than the radiation or looking at from the astronomical objects otherwise and we'll wind is All right thank you for coming in George You're welcome\nIs Tim swindle and this has been Arizona science you can also listen to this and other Arizona science segments by going to the Arizona Public me\nThe Cold War it is the longer the wavelength that it radiates out so we want to call the telescope down so the radiation of the telescope is longer and lower than the radiation or looking

planning a to speak with chemistry Nobel front a Nobel is Francis Arnold later this hour but briefly what did you win for\nShow a doctor or not and two other researchers George Smith and Gregory Winter where where did the chemistry Nobel for their work on directed evolution so this is basically one person called it applying the principles of Darwin in a test to taking advantage of natural selection\nAnd using it to um kind of direct bacteria or viruses to produce molecules that can be used for all kinds of peaceful purposes whether it's making antibodies or biofuels or drugs\n... and the chemistry Pulitzer Prize was split with two other researchers right Smith and Gregory Winter mhm and what what can they win for\n'em so they both work on a this technique called phage display which harnesses facts\nNatural selection and using it to um kind of direct bacteria or viruses to produce molecules that can be used for all kinds of useful purposes whether it's making antibodies or biofuels or drugs\n... I'm a chemistry Pulitzer Prize was split with two other researchers right Stuart Smith and Gregory Winter and and what to what to do when for [noise]\nUm so they both work on a this technique called phage display which harnesses bacteria phages there are viruses that infect bacteria um and it's kind of a ... the similar principle where you're taking advantage of these living systems to produce useful molecules proteins and antibodies that have all kinds of biological and medical applications\n... what about physics\nSo in physics the a prize was awarded to three researchers who work with lasers a pretty cool [laughter] I'm Arthur Ashe skin dried Murrow and Donna Strickland 'em and they basically not just use lasers but use lasers as tools so asking um develop this technique called optical tweezers where he basically\nFigured out that when you point a laser this focused beam of light out of spherical object the object is actually drawn towards the center of the beam and you can use that to manipulate things is teeny as particles or as big as bacterial cells\nA pretty cool [laughter] I'm Arthur Ashe skin dried Morocco and John Strickland 'em and they basically not just use lasers but use lasers as tools so African um develop this technique called optical tweezers where he basically\nFigured out that when you point a laser this focused beam of light atmosphere ... object the object is actually drawn towards the center of the beam and you can use that to manipulate\nThings just teeny as particles or as big as bacterial cells I've seen the ... yeah [laughter] it's a real life tractor beams I'm unfortunately doesn't work on that largest accumulate they're pretty focused but um it's fun to think about\n[laughter] and I after winning a done a Strickland explained what amazed her most about the research\nI think quite late generation is just one of these remarkable things one color like water any clear anything at all come to color was short and and it's just remarkable that there were all this color\nOne of these remarkable things one color like water any clear anything at all come to color was short and and it's just remarkable that there were all this color\nStarting at four pm every day here on NPR eighty nine boy one\nSaturday and weekend edition twists and turns at the Supreme Court saga and what it means come November when Americans cash their balance also are Tom Bowman in Raqqa Syria and the story of a veteran trying to find his piece\nWhen I decided I was gonna so capable that sewing machine and I was like I'm gonna do it right now\nAnd I literally just shake my head we can tradition Saturday from NPR News\nSaturday morning from six to ten year old NPR eighty nine Boyd one\nI'm Ira Flatow and you're listening to science friday we're talking with Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the twenty the Nobel Prize in chemistry um hey ... a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were very proud\nWe've got ... I was like I'm gonna do it right now\nAnd I literally just shake my head we can tradition Saturday from NPR News\nSaturday morning from six to hear on NPR eighty nine boy one\nI'm Ira Flatow and you're listening to science friday we're talking with Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the twenty the Nobel Prize in chemistry um hey you\nA lot of people think you're a scientist but you were a very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the difference is well I Love to build\nThings I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] yes it's really amazing has changed so much in that Thirty years that I've been doing this so that today you really can't type out a DNA\nIn evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] yes it's really amazing has changed so much and the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you're saying that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nRight and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edit it but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology\nMolecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three so it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and make biological molecules in codes the ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules is a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules are so what\nMean then and what what do people mean ... whom when you say uh the\nSo it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules in codes to ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules is a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what you mean then and what what do people mean ... whom when you say uh the directed evolution of something what does that process me\nIt's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs race horses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube\nI can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product that I'm that what's the next step\n... and put it in a test tube I can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product that I'm about what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own\nAnd a day in day then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes\nThan I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with which one of those microbes makes a bitter protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you um take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt is it's sort of creating life and that so it was a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools of bias\nWhich one of those microbes makes a better protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you gonna take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt's sort of creating life in that sell as a new you're creating a new form of life are you are not [noise]\nWell I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools of biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells\nBut you do you need the cell to help you make the protein [noise]\nWell actually so [noise] you don't have to have to sell there's now very powerful systems where you can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\nAnd so uh where do you eventually see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make their ... agents and and\nProtein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\nAnd so uh where do you rent truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make\nTheir ... agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\nMy time you're talking about have fun for swing molecules to have sex Oh yes [laughter] I Do [laughter]\nWell if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dieting codes\nYou have to wonder why nature would devise such a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dating coach something

could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discourage did an ad plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model and mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept him or good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm I'm a

important and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out and to try to pull out what is that genetic basis\nWhile you weren't you in touch with my my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I can be while you've got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools were ... that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have\n... powerful enough tools to do that but I'm also interested in how do you use a guy and machine learning to interpret

how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately our guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago\nHer newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and um [noise]\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners are pointing in the first one Alex is from Chicago hey I'll learn a neighbor\n[noise] hey hey there you go ahead so odd\nPreviously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nHow as a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist systems that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American\nAs my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nAs a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist systems that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicides mystic systems unknowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to tighten if I as a feminist um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system and so I'm being able to see\nThe fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing as a feminist\nUm in identifying myself in such a way it really changed my mind\nI'm In the thought about that that's great thanks for calling us that is great that's very heartening\nHe's he's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we others see yes\nI think that is part of the problems and I think a big problem is that we'll spend two don't trying to defend our end points of view instead\nThey'll be a male male experiences while existing reminisced a and identify myself in such a way really changed my mind\nUm and I thought about that that's great thanks for calling us that is great that's very heartening\nIs you know as part of the problem was that we don't see how we others see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is that we often spend you know I'm trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view\nAnd we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience [noise]\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions do require man he requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect another view and listen to it\nPerson's own experiences so in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that to somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions do require man he requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect and their their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way pauses math\nAnd these things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects that bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician\nIn order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some from the current events or let's turn out to the oddest topic in current events and that is voters in Congress are divided over whether to believe accusations of sexual assault ticket and it's a joke\nSo deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician who not\nLet's talk about some some uh current events or let's turn out to the oddest topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and it's a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether this should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process as at plagues tell me what you mean by that\nThat's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things and things\nStarting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because all of the people who claimed to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence\nThere is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume ... someone innocent until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser\nUndone accused personnel let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man on the woman both innocence at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and philosophy has studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels or finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of presuming the U.S\nThe innocence until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a paradox because we can't actually hold the man on the woman both innocence at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and philosophy has

of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look whoa whoa that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that well and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to be innocent until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen and does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so\nCreated a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether your prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women\nThat being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off and that's\nReally about whether your prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault overtime and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo the next problem is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between I'm\nSo there is a an argument's around saying something like um you\nAre making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor long but said on his book that that we are characterizing just spin the bottle crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is\nIn between I'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like ... you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor lung but said on his book that that we are characterizing just spin the bottle crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and straw person arguments while you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\n'em to finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing a little while you have to decide what you'll default position is and then to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nAnd finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing law where you have to decide what you'll default position is and then to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nAnd the thing is that in\nA court case and the trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very sure that they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court\nAppointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important\nAnd so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good and important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation to be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial\nDoing is we're giving something something very good and important and\nSo we should be very sure that they deserve that very good an important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a

developing beetles and um we didn't know before whether that was a good thing or a bad thing um but we did know that um that this association existed and so this is something that we wanted to investigate more\nTo understand the consequences of that interaction for telling me tell me what did you learn\nWell um [laughter] we looked at all in all different parts of the um ... and we found

so it's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there are a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um\nHe cheese in NSF graduate research fellow in the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome\nTo science friday thank you very much for having me first what what moon is is we're ready to give us a little thumbnail description\nSure yeah so it's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there\nAre a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of them went to the size of the points\nSo the size of the planet is ah about the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell a and then the moon is uh like I say about the size and the mass of net\nPlayed on the net and pretty unusual well known that big well it certainly unexpected right where if you look at the moon's in our solar\nSystem ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat are sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this was\nAnd that's pretty unusual well moon that big a well it's certainly unexpected right when if you look at the moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said uh you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat are sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see so large\nYou know because we think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a peace it doesn't look like that in this case uh yeah\nIt's right there so there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact or scenario like how we got earth moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planted in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like a nap tunes largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ... [noise] so\nIt looked like that and this case uh yeah\nIt's funny you know there's so there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact or scenario like how we got earth's moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planet in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like a Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is it well you tell us how\nYeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet then we would expect a big dip a front\nThe exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far is using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing\nIf you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the starlight\nIf there is a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks out some of the light as well\nIn addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet and so that makes the planet ... around a bit as it as it orbits the store and so\nSometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late\nAnd so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also or something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're\nAttributing to them and they insist on that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they say out loud so it's an extraordinary claim\nEarly other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're\nAttributing to them hey says and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they say out loud\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and is the famous thing goes next door now claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to\nRule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA good question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system and that's that's pulling on this planet and making and walk around a those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations\nAnd uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible is not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system\nSomething happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system uh that's that's pulling on this planet and making and wobble around a those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations\nAnd uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible is not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm\nIt was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you write very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about this\nVery sure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits it with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observed this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth so you'd have\nAnd a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nOr so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event ah we observe this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth\nSo you'd have to stitch together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that are that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point\nGoing to be hell why yeah if it had been spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a ... aware as Hubble orbits the earth or when we performed this observation you know you can imagine Hubble staring at this target but then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes now\nUm it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point it's going to\nBe helped one yeah if it had been spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a ... aware as Hubble orbits the earth\nOr when we performed this observation you know you can imagine Hubble staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James jaded just he won't have that problem and like I say the mere is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah uh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly one of the time so we're going to have to have a very good case\nYou know there are downsides officer now there isn't\nA matter of obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think some law when we made it twice as big we've sent whatever yeah sure yeah you\nSo there's other telescopes coming down the pike ... their people bidding right now to well the we talked about\nThis a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly for the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know there are downsides officer now there isn't\nA matter of obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think some law when we made it twice as big we've sent whatever\nYeah sure yeah you know so there's other telescopes coming down the pike ... their people bidding right now to well the we talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah that's a\nUh I I don't know who's working on it but it's it's a ultraviolet and a red and optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so ah they they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instruments stadium is the will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is All right so if this is a strange ... planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nA great question and one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come with the question why do we care about these\nMaterial misty will definitely be an improvement on Hubble but you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it really amazing\nIt is All right so if this is a strange ... planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems\nWe are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here happened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here\nAnd that of course speaks directly to ah the question about the origin of life for example ah so it's particularly since this a moon is raising new questions about how you get something like this\nIt's opening up the new questions about the dynamic all histories of these uh a planetary systems and and the speaks directly to that\nAnd the more exoplanets you discover\nAcross the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here and that of course speaks directly to uh the question about the origin of life for example there are so it's particularly since this moon is raising new

balance also are Tom Bowman in Raqqa Syria and the story of a veteran trying to find a speech when I decided I was gonna so capable ... and I was like I'm going to do it right now\nAnd I literally just shake my head introducing Saturday from NPR News Saturday morning from six to ten here on NPR eighty nine point lead one\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book\nThe poison squad one came a single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five I'm let's turn that the the clock back\nTo that time period Deborah or you have an entire chapter on catch\n[laughter] what was going to that ... devoted well I read it I Know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up\nSo this is it gets it it's just amazing\nSeven to for eight to five five I'm let's turn up the the clock back to that time period ... or you have an entire chapter on ...\n[laughter] what was so and then after that ... while you're devoted well I read it I Know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is a catch up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny first century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based kind of a but\nIn the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of thin nasty a sauce with a lot of vegetable ways to end that people would put pumpkin runs people would put tomatoes but they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called our guys and then because of the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dump preserve it is and it like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... because of this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair and in this\nPumpkin ... people would put tomatoes but they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called Tara dies and then because of the whole mess of it\nTended to kinda be rotten anyway they dumped preserve it as in a like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... because of this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz and he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said that kept the bacterial count down\nAnd then he really went to war a mean this was a\nBetween business and advocates and and ... business friendly government and Heinz although he was a big believer in profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his uh\nCatch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz and he did it so there was a lot of tomato an acid that kept the bacterial count down\nAnd then he really went to war a mean this was a battle\nBetween business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz ... though he was a big believer and profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives\nI Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nPlus you know there was a major\nCombat over the preservatives and get er and that was pretty fascinating but let's talk about a ...\nHarvey Washington where I was a little bit more than ... the focus of your book in the poison squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that because what if one of the ... yet the main thing\nIt's just crazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this\nThe preservatives and get er and that was pretty fascinating let's let's let's talk about a ... Harvey Washington where I only a little bit more than ... the focus of your book in the partisan squad um\nHe actually started where people volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that what is the only one of the ... yes it was amazing it's just\nCrazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know at\nCompletely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animals safety testing at all I'm just going to dump these things into human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees a mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week\nSkip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animal safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things into human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison quote squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at ... which is a cleaning product he looked at salary silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems and because\nTo hide and food he looked at ... which is a cleaning product he looked at cell of silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety [noise]\nKnow that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras spray he his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also like to enter a preacher conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety\nKnow that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras right he and his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also like to enter a preacher\nThe conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling\nAnd and widely really I mean what was interesting about him was that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party spilling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government\nThe layers of it apart and the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on travel golf\n[laughter] they can take a drink of water that are there you go um\nThis very early sense of the role of the government when we say on the constitution promote the general welfare this is kind of how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare in your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person who drives a conversation right for thirty something years\nDay life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right but he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually dead that's the\nThing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person who drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually we're in we're in our laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be\nI Am so after you know he's like battling always stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws
