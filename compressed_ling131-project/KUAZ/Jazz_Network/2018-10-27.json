referring to it as a dwarf planet\nSeries is the the largest object in the asteroid belt so it's in between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter\nIt's about nine hundred and fifty kilometers in diameter so so it's sort of in between the size of\nA normal asteroid and what we usually think of as planet so it's for example in between the size of smaller asteroids bigger than smaller asteroids but smaller than mercury the smallest of the planet so you know I you know I'm In college or we refer to it as a dwarf planet because it's large\nIt's around if you look at it you would probably think it's a planet but it's imbedded in this other population of smaller objects\nWhat do you mean by an ice\nSo so it's sort of in between the size of\nA normal asteroid and what we usually think of his planet so it's for example in between the size of smaller asteroids bigger than smaller asteroids but smaller than mercury the smallest of the eight planets so you know I you know I'm In college or we refer to it as a dwarf planet because it's large\nIt's around if you look at it you would probably think it's a planet but it's imbedded in this other population of smaller objects\nWhat do you mean by an ice volcano\nLike we're used to thinking about on earth or other planets Venus or Mars or refers to melting portions of the interior of the planet bringing it up to the surface rubbing it onto the surface sometimes using it on to the surface sometimes exploding it onto the surface\nAbroad bringing it up to the surface in some way and the reason it's liquid rock on earth or Venus or Mars is because the interior of earth and Venus and Mars is is made of rocky material at least the upper few thousand kilometers are so\nSeries and other objects farther out in the solar system are made of rock also but also a lot of ice water I just saw leads to out so if you melt portions of the interior of series or\nSay Europa or an icy moon of Jupiter Saturn and you bring that up to the surface the liquid that you're putting on to the surface or the the lava\nBecause the interior of earth and Venus and Mars is is made of rocky material at least the upper few thousand kilometers are so\nSeries

of Jupiter Saturn and you bring that up to the surface the liquid that you're putting on to the surface or the lava if you will that you're putting on to the surface is going to reflect\nThat composition of the inside of the planet so an series\nA lot of the inside is is ice solid water melts it and you bring up a lot of the ... going to be liquid water\nHow are these similar to are different from the volcanoes were used to that are these going to be ones that are going to explode or lose or do you know what they're going to do\nYeah that's a good question and and that really is is part of the heart of the of the study of of ice volcanoes we've never seen an ice volcano a rough like the mountain on theories that we're studying that we're seeing is ah is what we call ... or an ice volcano we don't get to see it are up like we see\nVolcanoes on earth wrapped so we're stuck trying to figure out what parts of volcanism that were used to on earth applied\nYeah that's a good question and and that really is is part of the heart of the of the study of of ice volcanoes we've never seen an ice volcano erupts like the mountain on theories that we're studying that we're seeing is ah is what we call ... or an ice volcano we don't get to see it are up like we see\nVolcanoes on earth are wrapped so we're stuck trying to figure out what parts of volcanism that were used to an earth applied to ice volcanoes and what parts might be different\nSo we think based on the shape of the mountain that we see on series of shape of the volcano\nThat it's a neat losing category it probably didn't have this huge explosive or ups and like we sometimes stereotypically think about a fertile ... those are probably more slowly lose onto the surface and slowly over time built up a mountain\nWhat are the techniques you use to study these\nA lot of it is looking at images from the dawn spacecraft and a lot of it is is looking at pictures and you can take these pictures and you can make a map of the surface and you can make a map of the elevation of the surface that's what we call topography\nAnd we supplement that with computer simulations and our computer simulations tell us how we think these mountains get built\nOver time built up a mountain what are the techniques you use to study these\nA lot of it is looking at images from the dawn spacecraft and a lot of it is is

with computer simulations and our computer simulations tell us how we think\nThese mountains get built and they tell us how we think the mountains of all over time and disappear over time and so that combination of observations from from the dawn mission and our computer simulations are models is is very powerful and and we think is taught us quite a bit about the volcanic history of series\nHow did you get started on this sort of work did you start out fascinated by ice or by volcanoes or by spacecraft\nSort of all of the above a the fun the fun part about this mission is dawn represents one of the missions that his that was the first mission to visit this object serious had never been visited by spacecraft before a much much like New Horizons of Pluto recently [noise]\nSo it's always fun

the subjects in science it's popular science senior senator Sophie Bush with [noise]\nWith have you back nice to be here so when we're when we go let's talk about this we're exactly the researchers find these micro plastic\nSo researchers um they had a group of eight subjects I'm from countries all over Europe and Asia and essentially had these subjects keep a food diary for a week and then at the end of the week they were they took a stool sample from themselves and sent it to the researchers and then the researchers had the sun job picking through that\nThey were looking for ten different types of plastic and they found these these plastic types that on nine of them and they were in all of the samples [noise] still samples to his own right for our body yet we eat them and then we send

her\nRight researchers have found micro plastics in tap water in the er it's in seafood um because a lot of these plastic fragments get into the waterways and then\n... them and we eat the fish\nOr the other thing is that all you know a lot of us drink water from plastic bottles or food out of plastic takeout containers are that's been wrapped in plastic and there's all sorts of chances for fragments to come off so the definition of a micro plastic is that it's smaller than\nFive millimeters but it can be much much smaller than that you know some of these fragments or on the nano meter scale\nAnd and we suspect that there's no harm coming from the\nVery difficult to tell you because it it's hard to sort of parse out um you can't really feed people some people plastic samples and not be the other people plastic samples at this point it's just not at the flea\nFeasible but um it it's hard shell maybe they're just passengers harmlessly it's also possible that they could be

it it's hard to sell maybe they're just passengers harmlessly it's also possible that they could be accumulating and that um a lot of these plastics carry chemicals that they might need each into the

a bit better and he was\nConvinced that the best thing to do and wants to treat blood as a commodity really so he thought that was when ten must come out and if you used blood you should supply blood

happy to be here\nWe're happy to have you so what is so special about breathing through your nose\nWell a nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system so evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several\nKey aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing the smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory nerves\nAll of our sensory systems and there are several\nKey aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing the smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory neurons are the only part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our ex turn all world\nAnd the way that this information gets from these neurons inside of our noses\nInto the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems information relays through a structure called the ... before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas\nBut in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose into the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus um and what's special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear\nInformation relays through a structure called the thalamus before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas but in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose into the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus\nUm and what special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear learning and memory so this gives a little faction of sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas in the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling\nNasal inhalation provides a sort of entry point by which breathing rhythms can modulate brain activity in these structures\nAre so just the active breathing through your nose was you knows also strange the air is coming in and alert these this pathway on the ... point in your brain and say hey something interesting happened\nRight it yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity or not only responsive to chemicals so they're not only monitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are that can er\nSo just the act was breathing through your nose was you know it was also strange the air is coming in and learn these this pathway on me and point in your brain and say something interesting ...\nIt yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity\nOr not only responsive to chemicals so they're not only monitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are the kennel receptors so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the\nThe nose yes um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythms just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby

you I mean [noise] uh we we use as far as his tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and helps your taste buds taste what which were actually doing is there a connection there\nRight that is true that is a good point um and that's\nThat's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have food inside of our mouth I'm the air can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going out word rather than in word\nUm and it definitely impacts flavors and and taste yes\nLet's talk about your study

MRI [noise]\nI'm no that's an in that's a very interesting point um we did not use fmri right because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located very very deep almost in the center of the brain uh making them very hard to reach noninvasive Lee so we can't record from these areas\nFrom electrodes on the surface of the scalp\nAnd functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study\nWe worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these Olympic areas for patients who

people with memory problems also having issues with smell [noise]\nThat that's a really good point um a lot of neurodegenerative diseases actually do present with early olfactory decline I'm In well I think are these findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for neurodegenerative disease I think um [noise]\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggests

and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing is so easy to measure\nAnd this is something that we're looking into and in the lab so do um patience with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nAnd so that's something you're you're going to be following up we're right yes I Am ... any Moore degenerative disease in particular\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with

only thing I'm going to just throw this is talk of some really dumb [laughter] are I mean why do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have our noses and are we the only animals are breathing through our mouth\nYou know I I really like a great question and I spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I I mean I think the answer probably goes far beyond just the sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested\nYou have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Aaron and still live in one that was laid off and on one um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that the full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really\nThat actually I I mean I think the answer

interesting point I Know that um well most mammals that that I can think of do\nPant and parenting is is typically something that involves mouth breathing so dogs pant not only when they're hot but I think also when they're stressed\nCats as well and I think that's um something interesting about that because mouth breathing is altering activity and these emotions centers and fears centers of the

technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drunks and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think ... is communicated really effective what's he has served as you went as you knew him well I didn't really I don't think any of that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie\nA he had a sense of humor he was a funny guy uh but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about uh [noise]\nUh you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues and ask her own office\nI think we do is communicated really effective was he as a reserve as you went as you knew him and well I didn't really I don't think any of that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I

a\nA you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues and ask her own office so you know I think it's a bit of both the was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but uh but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out [laughter]\nUm you didn't get that impression too much in the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life than required concentration and diligence yeah\nAnd there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI think engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies do you see that there's an engineer there's a very serious one there's ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair perfect portrayal because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how ...\nAnd there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI think engineers have a whole variety of

polled the scenes of space flight where you had a Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting anytime we saw people flying ... you'd was that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people assume you have this\nFun floating feeling but especially in the Gemini capsules the mercury there wasn't a lot of room that you were really crammed in there the cockpit is right in your face the control panel so I think that was a very accurate portrayal ... all the switches engages are just right there so that and then of course

worth telling\nHey thanks for that call you know I spent a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got to proceed you know to go landing on the ...\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible in the last one office there were I mean there were other candidates for the job but for sure the Gemini eight experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous missions and I was just looking at all life magazines from that month\nIn that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seat you know to go landing on them oh\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible in the astronaut office there were I mean there were other candidates for the job\nBut for sure the Gemini eight experience was a a really key point I was a really dangerous mission and I was just looking up all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really a kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race\nA kind of success or failure in that sense but a ... a fantastic a moment [laughter] so captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very very exciting I'm ... the big emotional punch of the story was and Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old\nAnd then the loss of the fellow astronauts on the lead up to Apollo you know weapons Apollo one whatever how do you think these humans just lost his shaped history has has played out\nI you know I mean these things or if I I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses because they had been

they were used to it but nobody's really used to losses like that and especially losing a child is something that nobody can really knowing this happened to them\nBut I think those things deeply affected Armstrong to the degree that we can say and those those things were communicated really effectively in the movie in a way that I thought it was really poignant and powerful ... you know we really don't usually see the personal\nIn a way that I thought it was really poignant powerful ... you know we really don't usually see the personal side astronaut lot of films Apollo Thirteen we saw

I Believe was a ... some kind of Netflix theories about about that and also some kind of documentary series that was regarded yeah\n... and all the people who were in that control room and all the other places and you know\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories um it's interesting ah hey this this is a movie um about their worlds who've astronaut certainly fifty years ago\nAnd it will be fifty years since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff\nYeah ... and all the people who were in the control room and all the other places and you know\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories\nUm it's interesting of this this is a movie\nUm about the heroes of astronauts nearly fifty years ago\nAnd it will be fifty years since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also\nHave Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff why is Hollywood still talking about things that happened fifty years ago when so much has happened since what do you think [noise]\nYeah I mean that's a good question I I think part of it is that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big stuff that human exploration has has done\nIn the last fifty years I mean that the shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible as like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that\nUh and that is that like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get\nThere do you know that's when I when we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any store\nFifty years I mean that that shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting an incredible as like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that\nUh and that is that like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get\nTheir due [laughter] I Know that's when I when we were talking about because they said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and they're ... and other places\nYeah and you know what we also hear about any stories of any other countries in his basement ... there are so many other asked if there are so many countries up there\nRight now I mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russians I think there'll be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're older travails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like ah there's many ways to make sense for into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and\nThose are sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to be sort of looking backward movies I think maybe there is something to be said about\nStory to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're older travails and difficulties in\nThe space dog like a ... there's many ways to make her into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think\nMaybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back rules with imagining the future\nIs your what are they talking about a NASA these days about\nAh so what what are big project is actually trying to get back to the mood so that ah the Ryan as the last programs and all of exploration systems element so\nYou know really I think we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of a story to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering and how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell\nWhat it takes to actually get to the flight\n... for the astronaut to fly on it ... Bennett Mason Arizona Welcome to science friday\nThank you my name's Ben and uh yeah\nThose flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of uh stories to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering and how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could\nFigure out how to tell what it takes to actually get to the flight ... for the astronaut to fly on it mhm bend in Mesa, Arizona welcome to science friday\n... thank thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I Would I Would think it'd be interesting to uh make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop the launching a and unfortunately that did not happen\nUm and it in the end it affected them in ways that many people did though of course in fact it killed the crew but oh I think that many of the of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made on the day in the ... the day before the launch which were critical\nKill the crew but oh I think that many of the engineers story to tell us well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made or the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and uh\nI'm I'm and I'm sure it will be you know a crucial to understanding the accident Mm [laughter]\nYou know you mentioned the Orion mission that wants to get us back to the moon is is it going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Powell\nIn order to know are getting to the moon is just as hard today as it was in the Nineteen sixties\nI mean we know a little bit more we haven't experienced base of one to draw from a but actually going to the moon mission is going to be justice risky it's just it's hard to do um the amount of a prop we need when Neal said he wished for more ...
