one attraction is that culture is unique and distinct from the U.S and the history is long Japanese history goes back at least two thousand years so there's many traditions\nReligious and cultural and regional differences it's a very safe country low crime rate and people are generally very friendly towards visitors international visitors I Would think the culture is so rich\nWell one attraction is

differences it's a very safe country low crime rate and people are generally very friendly towards visitors international visitors\nI Would think the culture is so rich and long and treasured that an American would be forever in outsider how realistic is it to be you know accepted if you if you move in here you're always going to be the foreigner\nYes the best thing is to get involved in some kind of group\nWhether it's your neighborhood if you're living in an apartment become active in your neighborhood association or if you're going to school then joined some clumps of a student's university or high school\nAnd if you were working for a company go out hang out with people outside of work as well as in work and usually when you become associated with the group then you're accepted or not

they want to learn English a lot of my friends have gone to Japan and and they are and they're living teaching English as a second language\nYes it's true or many Japanese wish to be able to speak English and visit the U.S or other countries English speaking countries\nAnd it's you know Tokyo is going to host a twenty twenty Olympics So there's really a a high demand for interpreters translators of English in other languages and people want to learn English so that is one good way to make contacts are friendships with Japanese\nThat's Monday evening at seven o'clock here on NPR

always curious about this it seemed like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace pop religions that come and go [noise] did you have any ever think about that well you're in Japan\nI think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either she do or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she still has to do with\nSacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival I might be Buddhist it might be she though it might be Christian and you're\nIt and most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife whereas she still has to do with\nSacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival I might be Buddhist it might be seen though it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just setting up the numbers who said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought it in a ... plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred [laughter] but it right away because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I guess you'd say for missionaries such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody except Christianity and then exclude the other religions\nOr so and as a missionary you'd have to do when I was from the northern God's before me or or this sort of write exclusive and that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kind of like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so they would that's right they would pick on\nBecause my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody except Christianity and then exclude the other religions\nI saw it as a missionary you'd have to do with us from the northern God's before me or or this sort of a rite exclusive\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kinda like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so they were ... they would pick on Christianity but but it wouldn't be\nThe only religion Ruthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what his Buddhism and what is Hindu as I Am and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally ... into means the way up the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate offerings too that God that help God of agriculture for example\nSo there are no images inch into like statues are idols or anything\nMuslim or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate offerings too that God that help God of agriculture for example\nSo there are no images inching do like statues are idols or anything and it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the upper who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state and then the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and missed that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals it's sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it it's the idea of sacredness making things clean\nBut again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and missed that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals it's sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something a sheep though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or ... rice planting festivals that are related to ... though so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas one year and and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk\nAnd then on New Year's it you know like a whole time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging this song what a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of ...\nConfused at holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas when you're in and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was

banging this gong what a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of since that you may have\nCommitted that temple down very slowly hundred and eight times and then as soon as midnight\nPassed on New Year's morning people flock to the shuttle shrine to pray for health and success\nAnd happy new year and by ambulance\nOr even something to put in your car for a traffic safety and so on at the ... so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she'd do for the new year\n[noise] this is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you can make you hear a book is the moon guide book called the living abroad Japan and routine when we're thinking about living in Japan what's the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on a hand in the domestic world these days or or just in general yes\nSomething to put in your car for traffic safety and so on at the ... so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she'd do for the new year [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you connect you hear a book is the moon guide book called the living abroad Japan and really the one we're thinking about living in Japan what's the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on a hand in the domestic world these days or or just in general\nSo I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment and a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is\nAnd I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities in terms of employment and a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes then they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true anymore so there isn't any changing yes so the younger generation has has pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to order on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get

your experience like were you doing for your work\nI was working as a teacher for the University of Maryland [laughter] um and I taught at a military base and it was clearly Japan\nUh and I live

really intimate relationship as people down there and\nIt really opened a lot of doors to have that close friendship with them and they were the ones that taught me all the Japanese are basically I ever learned\nSo you were able to break into the society as a foreigner and make real friendships with the locals\nI did and it was amazing there was two things that I did one of them was learn Japanese which are Ruthie alluded to which opens a lot of doors people are really really friendly once you at least make an effort and the other one was I tackled the transportation problem\nI didn't really want to buy a car because it's very expensive to buy a car very hard so I bought an extremely small motorcycle little fifty cc motorcycle but the maximum speed limit in Japan\nDid and it was
