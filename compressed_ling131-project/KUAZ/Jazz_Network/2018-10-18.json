life of its constituents\nUnlike my opponent I have no obligation to special interest groups I Would never called for a boycott of the state I'm committed to work towards measurable change in the incomes ... education rankings veteran care\nAnd border security in eight term sixteen years my opponent and hasn't been unable to fix either because he is unable to or because he is doesn't care

majority of our states border with Mexico so this first round we'll focus on issues related to border security and immigration the first question goes to Mr gr hauled off from a VPN Nancy monthly\nMr getting however there are many people across this country who feel that undocumented immigrants uh especially from Mexico and Central America are real drain on our community resources what's your take on that and can you give me some examples\nI I think what has to put that question and in in the context of what what has occurred for the last Eighteen months it even prior to that we've heard a a a very divisive or\nAttack on anything immigrants in this country by the president and others we've had her enforcement only policy uh by the president and others and his partner homeland security what we have is a border is very much an issue of economic uh economic\nIn the context of what what has occurred for the last Eighteen months it even prior to that we have had a a a very divisive uh\nAttack on anything immigrants in this country by the president and others we've had an enforcement only policy or by the president and others and his apartment of homeland security what we have is a border\nIs very much an issue of economic uh economic failure on the part of other parts of ... of Latin America but more importantly what we have at the border is an opportunity and what we're concentrating right now is an enforcement and division\nIt's no secret that everybody running for office goes and takes a picture and all that lives in front of of the wall and says this is what I Want to do\nThe issue is much more complex it ... it requires comprehensive approaches of solutions time we talked about solutions and not just continuing to batter a dead horse about an issue that is political rhetoric and really know solutions and be offered by the majority in Congress\nIs your parents and you have thirty seconds to respond\nObviously the the borders are complex situation it's going to take an enforcement\nShe was much more complex it ... it requires comprehensive approaches of solutions time we talked about solutions and not just continuing to batter a dead horse about an issue that is political rhetoric and really know solutions and be offered by the majority in Congress\nIs your parents and you have thirty seconds first fine\nWell obviously the the borders are complex situation it's going to take an enforcement of the regulations that we now have but it also involves comprehensive immigration reform and I'm for providing in a way for for the people to be treated with dignity\nAnd where they can earn a path to citizenship and I'll discuss more of that later\nThank you the next question is from Joe Ferguson at the Arizona Daily Star for Mr

Michel please indicate which candidate you'd like to answer first as a reminder both candidates will have forty five seconds to answer this question\n[noise] up Mr ... ... all of your legislation that you have supported and tried to put forth on the border are what are you most proud of and what what has been your biggest accomplishment\nI thought I thought the the effort the legislative efforts are\nHaving been accepted\nBoth candidates will have forty five seconds to answer this question\nA mystery ... you know all of your legislation that you have supported and tried to put forth on the border are what are you most proud of and what what has been your biggest accomplishment\nI thought I thought the the effort the legislative efforts or haven't been\nAccepted as legislative effort and when I began this process very few supported that moment of changed considerably in the last four years and we have some opportunities\nThe successes are convincing the previous administration about the need for stimulus packages ... son at least so that we could start to build up that infrastructure\nThe quarter going from the valley is a Tucson or that now receive twenty five billion dollars very proud of that\nAnd so it it's been a consequence of having someone in the White House that was appreciative of that and supported the local communities are legislatively it's got to be comprehensive reform and uh so far this has been an appetite by these majorities in Congress even tackle that\nNeed to stop you there Mr Peterson yeah forty five seconds to respond\nGoing from the valley is a Tucson or that now receive twenty five billion dollars very proud of that\nSo it has been a consequence of having someone in the White House it was appreciative of that and supported the local communities are legislatively it's got to be comprehensive reform and uh so far has been an appetite by these majorities in Congress Steven tackled that\nI Need to stop you there Mr Peterson yeah forty five seconds to respond\nAs far as uh the question that Mr Mahdi scriptures huh yes certainly\nWell one thing that um the incumbent has failed to tell us is that he had very little to do with the that money going to the border communities the other legislators worked very hard at that and and he's all happy to be in on the on the goodies on that\nSo it's an important area takes leadership and it takes someone as he mentioned that that can get the agreement of the others in Congress and I believe he's not in a position because of his views where he's going to be able to accomplish that and that's why we need change\nIncludes our segment on border related questions we naturally I came to the issues related to the environment at first\nOh happy to be on the on the goodies on that\nSo it's an important area takes leadership and it takes someone as he mentioned the ... that can get the agreement of the others in Congress and I believe he's not in a position because of his views where he's going to be able to accomplish that and that's why we need change\nThat includes our segment on order related questions we now turn our attention to issues related to the environment the first question is from a VPN Nancy Montoya the Centers for Mr ... reminder one minute response please\n[noise] ... and I know both of you are bilingual so you know that means water or Mr good at ... um about the Colorado River watershed a situation what should be the federal government's role\nIn having some kind of a drought contingency plans what should the federal government's role being that\nI think it's a federal government's role was we'll get to the Colorado River has to be proactive\nAnd right now just got a city back under this administration and see what the state of Arizona in their own stumbling around on what to do with a water management plan for the state given droughts given scarcity given the finite reality of that resource ah the federal government to step in\nI in having some kind of a drought contingency plan what should the federal government's role be an ...\nI think it at federal government's role was got to the Colorado River has to be proactive\nAnd right now just got a city back under this administration and see what the state of Arizona and their own stumbling around on what to do with a water management plan for the state given droughts\nGiven scarcity given the finite reality of that resource or the federal government to step in and provide guidance Colorado's a resource for Seventeen million people countless businesses\nFrom here to Southern California and beyond and so it is a resource that needs to be preserved we cannot allow uranium mining around the Grand Canyon to preserve that water source and we can not let the subsistence to continue to happen without having contingency plans and there's the quietest choices\nAnd this requires a user's a to understand that sometimes the highest users and consumers of water in the state or have to take a ... step toward the reality that we have now that we have to conserve this water and manage it much better than we're doing now thank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds for response\n... the water issue is a state issue that needs to be resolved\nAnd you'd have happened without having contingency plans and this isn't quite as choices\nAnd this requires a user's a to understand that sometimes the highest users and consumers of water in the state or have to take a ... step toward the reality that we have now that we have to conserve this water and manage it much better than we're doing now\nThank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds for a response\nWill ... the water issue is a state issue that needs to be resolved between the participating states in the central Arizona project\nI Would prefer that the federal government not not be involved and as far as the local sources of water currently we are to the city of Tucson is on the a P water and my biggest concern is the contamination level\nSo I think one of the biggest things we can do is forward or legislation that would create a national standard for for where the water quality and this is one thing that is missing in and we need scientific help on this\nAnd he now question from ... from the Arizona Daily Star this one is for Mr Peterson\nPearson how ... works in Congress to prioritize what is often seen as western issues such as federal versus private land use\nWill private land use 'em should first be taken up by the state one of the things\nStandard for for where the water quality and this is one thing that is missing in and we need scientific help on this\nAnd he now like in from ... from the Arizona Daily Star this one is for Mr Peterson\nPearson how ... works in Congress to prioritize what is often seen as western issues such as federal versus private land use\nWill private land use 'em should first be taken up by the state one of the things that ah I Would be in favor of is that the federal lands more those federal lands be turned over to the state\nSo that this could increase the educational trust fund any increase revenues from the state trust funds\nAnd with so much of the federal lands are in the state the uncontrolled by federal and a tribal entities that doesn't leave us much for the state trust lands and I think we should also swap outlandish ... that should be in the state trust lie and some of our state trust land is in Yuma proving ground so we should\nChange a swap land out so that that land that we can't use right now it's in the human proving grounds be part of the state trust land so creative things like that should be done that would increase the revenue to find our schools\nAre highly yeah thirty first time the public lands in Arizona\nTribal entities that doesn't leave us much for the state trust lands and I think we should also swap out land that ... that should be in the state trustworthy and some of our state trust land is in Yuma proving ground so we should\nChange a swap land out so that that land that we can't use right now it's in the human proving grounds be part of the state trust land so creative things like that should be done that would increase the revenue to find our schools\nAre highly yeah thirty seconds for\nThe public lands in Arizona and along the southwest are essential and a oversight by the federal government is essential\nRight now this administration has made the public lands uh uh one dimensional resource extraction oil gas mining period\nAnd that's a are public lands and our waterways as well like the Colorado a I run a national resource and I think that the prospect of the federal government could bring to this is that uh we need to protect those that he'd be conserved ... what do they need to conserve and more importantly if we look at climate change\nAnd that reality and as we look at what's going on with water in that reality those public lands becoming valuable in terms of how they fit into that picture\nAnd remind your will stick to the time limits any over ...\nI run a national resource and I think that the prospect of the federal government could bring to this is that uh we need to protect those that need to be conserved ... what do they need to conserve and more importantly if we look at climate change\nAnd that reality and as we look at what's going on with water in that reality those public lands becoming valuable in terms of how they fit into that picture\nAnd remind your will stick to the time limits any uh over just will result in a penalty later next ... this one is trying to tell them anything from our NPR sister station in Phoenix ... that you\nHave to have two questions first or do you favor Arizona implementing stricter water conservation throughout the state and secular and a follow up how would you work with the Arizona Governor to balance out our water needs with our gross\nYeah the ... the the domestic use\nThe household use of water are in this state has increase that's potentially as we have grown in population\nAnd and that has to be accommodated and and the issue of the use of water by mining companies has to be accommodated this has to be looked at in terms of how much they use how much certain ... certain crops used in terms of ...\nAlan ... our water needs with our gross\nYeah the ... the the domestic use\nThe household use of water are in this state has increased as potentially as we have grown in population\nAnd and that has to be accommodated and and the issue of the use of water by mining companies has to be accommodated this has to be looked at in terms of how much they use\nHow much certain ... certain crops used in terms of how the high use of water they had that has to be a factor did and and and the governor and\nOther elected officials must begin to look at those options are those are choices that they're facing a I think to ignore the fact that this finite resources going down there was a mistake another thing I Would do is this a shirt water a permit that is given to ah to developers like along the ... that the court just root root for\nAssured water seems to be has no criteria to it or I should water should really mean that scientifically assured water and I think many times are handed out as part of a development agreement when in reality there and water and we're losing thank you Mr Peterson yeah thirty seconds for our response\nWe're going to be fighting all over the world for water in it and in Arizona we really need to\nUh to developers like along the ... that the court just would rule for assured water seems to be has no criteria to it or I should watersheds really mean that scientifically assured water and I think\nMany times they're handed out as part of a development agreement when in reality not there and water and we're losing thank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds for ever stop\nWell we're going to be fighting all over the world for water and it and in Arizona we really need to address that so one of my biggest concerns is local\nAnd that local concerns involves our water table which at the moment has too many contaminates contaminants and this problem needs to be addressed because if there is a drought situation Tucson is going to be the one of the first ones to be suffering from this\nAnd obviously we need the cooperation of the central Arizona project to the extent that we can uh I don't want the federal government are involved only as a last resort\nAnd kids are next question comes from asking on this one is for Mr Peterson Mr Pearson\nUm should environmental policies are especially things like carbon emission standards should that be a federal and state or local issues poison and tell me why\nWell obviously a climate change is is in ... is a very critical\nTo the extent that we can uh I don't want the federal government are involved only as a last resort\nIn Cuba next question comes from acting on this one is for Mr Peterson Mr Pearce and\nUm should environmental policies are especially things like carbon emission standards should that be a federal and state or local issues ... in and tell me why\nWell obviously a climate changes isn't ... is a very critical issue we have to be leaders in protecting the environment our country should be leading in innovation in ways to protect the environment and clean the environment and uh as far as the carbon\nTax is concerned that has to be part of the total package which has dresses climate change\nTaking money from different areas for this um has to be considered very carefully because we we have to\nConsider the effects on our economy so we have to address this in a way that's a fiscally responsible\nYesterday ... thirty seconds for a response we the United states has become re engaged in the issue of\nTaking money from\nDifferent areas for this um has to be ... considered very carefully because we we have to consider the effects on our economy so we have to address this in a way that's a fiscally responsible\nYesterday ... thirty seconds for a response\nWe the United states has become re engaged in the issue of climate change is a worldwide issue\nIt affects his country where ... the\nThe greatest producer of uh the greenhouse effect in this in the world and we need to be involved that we should pull out of the Paris accord which in fact in science to drive the policies of the agencies like EPA an interior which has not been just a dismantled as a function of those agencies\nA health care transportation basic services broadband even get into those communities\nAnd so if you're going to deal with rural America or it's not just a question of waiting for Santa Claus I think there has to be initiatives on the part of the federal government\nAnd what's needed there is not just the issue of access is the issue of infrastructure and the the issue of retention\nA health care transportation basic services broadband you would get into those communities\nAnd so if you're going to deal with rural America or it's not just a question of waiting for Santa Claus I think there has to be initiatives on the part of of the federal government to provide\nThank you Mr how how fat either or we do have a follow up question also related to the environment is one comes from or district or issues related to a congressional districts three this one comes from Nancy Montoya um for Mr Pearson there's been\nA lot of the political realities is that a an elected official at the federal level is only as powerful as the committees you get placed on or if he were elected what\nSpecific committees would you see to be appointed to in order to help this district well first of all in helping this desert I can help the district\nMost from\nWorking from the local level are will work hard to be on the other committees in Congress I understand that you have to buy yourself a position\nThe only as powerful as the committees you get placed on or if you are like that or what specific committee's legitimacy to be appointed to in order to help this district well first of all\nIn helping this district I can help the district\nMost from\nWorking from the local level I Will work hard to be on the other committees in Congress I understand that you have to buy yourself a a position on a lot of those committees but I Will work locally for early by yourself\nWell I've understood that some of the positions you have to contribute money to your uh to the leadership to get a position\nSo I'm going to start locally and improve the economy and the living conditions in the district as best I can and I'm going to do the best I can to improve and gain access to committees um in in ... in Congress what committees\nWill the education committee is an important one we need to get more funding uh for here and also the um education or the immigration to protect the border and and to improve the border security and to work on immigration reform\nThank you Mr or how the yeah forty five seconds every elected a repeat of the committee say half and that if I'm fortunate enough to be in the majority\nAnd then gain access to committees um in in ... in Congress what committees will the education committee is an important one we need to get more funding uh for here and also the um education of the immigration to protect the border and and to improve the border security and to work on immigration reform\nThank you Mr gr how they you have forty five seconds sort of reelected all replaces the committee say have and that if I'm fortunate enough to be in the majority I Will be chairman of the national Resources Committee and the second most senior member\nOf the education and workforce committee so that some of the things and legislation concepts\nThat President majorities for the last eight years and not allowed even to to be hurt or a committee hearings will now have an opportunity to be debated and go through regular order if I have that opportunity and I'm reelected though that's I Would stay on the committees that among\nThank you for the remainder of tonight's debate or panel will be asking questions covering a variety of issues facing the district and the nation you know for ... years on Daily Star question now for Mr\n... is ... I'm Glad you mentioned regular order Congress hasn't passed the fall but for your budget in a very long time and said it passes a bunch of short term temporary measures notice ...\nIf I have that opportunity and I'm reelected ... that I Would stay on the committees that among\nThank you for the remainder of tonight's debate or panel will be asking questions covering a variety of issues facing the district and the nation Joe Ferguson at the Arizona Daily Star question now from Mr ...\nMr ... I'm Glad you mentioned regular order Congress hasn't passed the full but for your budget in a very long time instead of passes a bunch of short term temporary measures notice continuing resolutions he's get federal agencies little room to plan to make changes but give Congress and the president a tool for negotiating policy\nWould you advocate for or against this pattern and bought a budgeting\nAgainst I think one of the things that the house of representatives has to do as a coal equal member of Congress and up an important responsibility for the United States Congress house of representatives is to develop the budget and to develop the budget to each committee process\nTo have hearings to look at each agency and then from that budget is adopted then you go through the appropriations process of how you are going to spend that money\nAre we haven't done that just been piecemeal of that we have a good we're working under the continuing resolution till December seventh right now and nobody could plan we don't have an influence\nFor the United States Congress house of representatives is to develop the budget and to develop the budget to each committee process\nTo have hearings to look at each agency and then from that budget is adopted then you go through the appropriations process of how you are going to spend that money\nAre we haven't done that it's been piecemeal of that we have a good we're working under continuing resolution till December seventh right now and nobody can plan we don't have an infrastructure bill we don't have transportation bill we don't have a farm bill\nAnd uh I think that the American people deserve a much better they deserve some consistency and some ability to know what that decision is going to impact on them for that year and following years and we're not doing it\nIs you're passing you now have thirty seconds for response\nWell obviously we all would like a balanced budget at the federal level the problems are many in in designing a budget\nWhat needs to be done is you need to get agreement among both parties that we're going to be at a certain spending level and to take into consideration unfunded liabilities those are going to be hitting us we have a future of liabilities in terms of health care for elderly\nFor a response well obviously we all would like a balanced budget at the federal level the problems are many in in designing the budget\nWhat needs to be done as you need to get agreement among both parties that we're going to be at a certain spending level and to take into consideration unfunded liabilities those are going to be hitting us we have a future liabilities in terms of health care for elderly\nAnd so it's it's a difficult situation but we need to work hard on that\nQuestion now from kj ... his question instruments piercing\nOur border towns and cities three and they're hurting economically um prominent business citizens shuttered\nMain streets are drying up and the guy listen Douglas in San Luis so what do you propose to support these local areas as they attempt to bring some sort of economic stability or business back to those main streets\nWell that's a very important problem that we have all along the border and and the border cities what we need to do and what I have spent my life doing is working with small to medium sized businesses\nIn San Luis so what do you propose to support these local areas as they attempt to bring some sort of economic stability or business back to the main streets\nWell that's a very important problem that we have all along the border and and the border cities what we need to do and what I have spent my life doing is working with small to medium sized businesses\nAnd working within the community within the community organizations the nonprofit boards that I worked on creating a consensus on solutions to the problems so one of the things that we need to do is work with the ... public sector of the private sector and the educational institutions in the community so that we can find ways to\nSolve the problems in terms of a growing the economy\nAnd you need to create an environment that will that
