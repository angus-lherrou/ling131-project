in with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yes a Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girls get sold just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nFrom my father was a singer he came from Tipperary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous\nAnd my mother was a musician as harsh so she always had music

other blood ... down and also we were members of the game the league and the Irish American club in downtown Detroit\nAnd that was our community that was where we socialize so I sang my first son into a Mike there when I was seven for my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that at sessions singing sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing songs\nAnd people don't know that about Detroit it's uh it's got a very very strong Irish population\nHad a bit of Ireland in Detroit\nAbsolutely and then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my

generated by us and it was all song and story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like higher\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it seems to something larger the spirit\nIt bullied the spirits of the Irish who have left through the centuries of no choice of their own to make a living in other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the her role with people and pride of place every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive Rhode Island does a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about added\nTo I don't want people to run off the bus or throw me off the bus but yes you can sing a song about everything for me it punctuate and historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say and now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about you know winning race dogs there\nIt is a way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive around Ireland as a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in oh here's a new town that has a song about added\nTo I don't want people to run off the bus throw me off the votes but yes you can sing a song about everything for me it punctuate and historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say\nAnd now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about you know winning race dogs their songs about greed horses there are songs about people's families there are songs about deaths in communities drownings off the coast of kind of moderate that are heartbreaking so everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nAnd heartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began to your relationship with England and uh just tough times and civil war once Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell\nYou were subjugated by the the English for centuries you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how Ireland it's going to be managed by its own people\nExactly who is I'd argue on do you want a completely free Ireland or we take this interim step of twenty six counties until you can get\nSo than Nineteen sixteen rising yes big deal that was like the American revolution\nOnce Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell you were subjugated by the the English for centuries yes you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there was a civil war about how everyone's going to be managed by its own people\nExactly who aside are you on do you want a completely free Ireland or we take this interim step of twenty six counties until you can get\nMore so than Nineteen sixteen rising yes big deal that was like the American revolution and yes history just a little over a hundred years ago there must be songs that bring you back to that that stir your Irish patriotism more pride\nAnd even better than that right because some of the men and women who were actually on the front lines during the Easter Rising wrote the song some I'd like to sing one for you know if that's okay sure this is a song that was written by Paul Peirce Patrick Henry appears as one of the signatures of the proclamation of independence\nAnd it's a very powerful sunny took an old melody any real new words to it\nAnd he is saying to the

[noise]\nInformation about Cathy's albums enter performance sketch or on the website and that's Cathy Ryan dot\nAnd when we think about Ireland it's also proud culture of course it's got its struggle

violin dot com\nThat was born in Detroit now she goes Ireland county loves her home [noise]\nInformation about kept these albums and her performance schedule on her website That's Cathy Ryan dot\nAnd when we think about it also proud culture of course it's got its struggle with London to be independent and I understand that the first printed book of Irish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for everyone to\nIt's a valid history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most accepted it was Thomas Davis who was one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and condemnation and Plunkett\nWhen Ireland was starving during the great hunger Thomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist he didn't believe in aggression he was a Protestant as well\nSome people listening might think oh it's between Catholics and Protestants knows that the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted to Ireland to be so nation but he wrote songs and he believed\nThat the best way to serve the history of the country was through its balance\nHunger Thomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist he didn't believe in aggression\nHe was a Protestant as well some people listening might think oh it's between Catholics and Protestants knows that the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted to Ireland to be its own nation\nBut he wrote songs and he believed\nThat the best way to serve the history of the country was through its ballot tree\nAnd I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are ... they still exist were still singing them they keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of this struggle or this this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up in that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about off it's not the culture of celebrity that's sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the June and we are\nThe tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can

rumored to have been eaten by cap\nWas it true or did he grow\nAs the official reports great\nJournalist Carl Hartman was determined to find out what actually happened to Michael the Rockefeller\nThe Twenty one year old son at New York governor Nelson Rockefeller was never\nSeen again after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one up\nWe traced Rockefeller's drink combed through

often\nRetraced Rockefeller eastern combed through our times and interviewed ... witnesses to come to his own conclusions which he writes about in Savage Harvest a tale of cannibals colonialism and Michael Rockefeller's tragic quest Carl good to have you back on the show thanks so much\nSo did I said that Rockefeller story up correctly there\nYes no question I mean I'm Michael graduate he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and\nWent off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called than a few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were\nIncredible ... and he determined to go to as Matt and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick a sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back for a couple of months and\n... and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were\nIncredible ... and he

he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and are on that trip he vanished\nSo Michael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one in your studying of this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to the his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nI think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around our you know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball and um you know some of the greatest started of of the world\nHe was enamored of ... and fascinated by asthmatic culture and has met carving it means you know the best\nWith well I think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around\nOur you know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball and um you know some of the greatest start of of the world\nKey was enamored of ... and fascinated by asthmatic culture and asked Matt carving it means you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were you know twenty three twenty four foot high a polls kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it and I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he you know got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd this is in New guinea this is a huge island down them between Thailand and Indonesia is one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics of that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch

fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and ah\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence\nOf which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an integral part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and Michael unwittingly stepped into a
