Peterson thirty seconds if you'd like to\nSew the role of the federal government I think is certainly in planning however some of the the very drastic conditions are facing the ... county in particular need to be a partnership between local jurisdictions and the federal government\nOne of the first things we can do is appointed director of beer on land management that's an important function and important person that can relate to the the water situation in a crisis we're facing a coach he's county I think decisions about water need to be made locally by local jurisdictions they need to be at the table\nThank you or next question comes from Lorraine ... under those four moons Marquez Peterson how were you were to get Congress to prioritize what are often seen as western issues like federal versus private land use and water conservation policy\nI think it's really about having a seat at the table engaging in committees that react to to those issues um I in particular are interested in the energy and Commerce Committee I think that's my background in that suits very well\nI think that would be able to provide perspective and an independent voice in Congress on somebody's very important issues is key and that's how we'll get things done\nLike you must Kirkpatrick you have thirty seconds I was on the transportation and Infrastructure Committee and plants\nBeing a seat at the table engaging in committees that react to to those issues um I in particular are interested in the energy and Commerce Committee I think that's my background in that suits very well\nI think that being able to provide perspective and an independent voice in Congress on some of these very important issues is key and that's how we'll get things done\nI think you misspoke about trick you have thirty seconds I was on the transportation and Infrastructure Committee and plan to be on that committee again working in southern Arizona to improve infrastructure\nAnd get funding for projects working with mayor Rothschild what's a local mayors and CD chews up to improve that critical infrastructure which we need to do to improve our economy it's so important that we have good roast that we have a working water system that we have\nGood paying twenty first century jobs and a quality education for our children those are all infrastructure projects\nOr next question is to ms Marquez Peterson and it comes from Steve ... sting\nMoves markets Peterson coming back to swim as prepared for kids or what would you do when\nYou have to say about people from mid west out of state step in\nGood paying twenty first century jobs and quality education for our children those are all infrastructure projects\nOr next question is to ms Marquez Peterson and it comes from Steve ... sting\nMoves markets Peterson coming back to swim as prepared for kids said what would you do when\nHave to say about people from mid west out of state stepping in there\nTalked to folks throughout coaches county including the Fort what you've got the development ah\nLand development companies um\nIs so many folks had different opinions air and I'm Still truly going to stand by the fact that we need and local jurisdictions in those organizations at the table\nIt needs to be a local solution certainly federal government can provide support in the planning but I think we need to rely on stilts and in ... county to solve this problem and not step in and the federal government to try and solve that for them\nThank you and most Kirkpatrick my mistake that question was actually supposed to go to use a we'll give you a full minutes to an ...\nAh\nYeah yeah water is so critical uh and I know that a Senator Kyl and Senator McCain we're working closely with me to come\nThe federal government can provide support in the planning but I think we need to rely on fell to the ... county to solve this problem and not step in is the federal government to try and solve that for them\nThank you I miss Kirkpatrick my mistake that question was actually supposed to go to use a we'll give you a full minutes to an ...\nAh\nYeah yeah water is so critical uh and I know that a singer Kyle and Senator McCain we're working closely with me to come up with a strategy for Arizona one of the things we really need to do is have a state wide drought plan we are in a drought but we need to be all working together\nOff of the same blueprint to preserve our water that includes things like\nLow uh uh or more efficient\nA water\nTanks waters thinks are using gray water where we can a conservation measures perhaps collecting rainwater to a garden with oh there's so many things that we can do that really we are doing it it takes leadership\nIt takes leadership like Senator McCain was providing for do that and I plan to provide that leadership in Arizona and throughout the west not only in congressional district\nYou thank you and our next question will be\nAh using gray water where we can a conservation measures perhaps collecting rainwater to a garden with oh there's so many things that we can do that really we are doing it it takes leadership\nIt takes leadership like Senator McCain was providing for do that\nAnd I plan to provide that leadership in Arizona and throughout the west not only in congressional district to\nThank you and our next question will be to you miss Kirkpatrick comes from Jo burg describes trick should Congress step into local water decisions such as the ... subdivision in service to several thousand homes if it threatens the prophet of property is like for her to go\nYou know I used to serve on the water commission and one of the real concern I had was approval of the subdivisions what's out actually looking\nA water source for those subdivisions that would've really saved us family\nA lot of problems it has to be a joint effort between the federal government and the state government working together to make sure that we've got checks and balances in place so people aren't sold land or houses that don't have adequate water\nI really feel for that family they invested their end\nThe subdivisions what's out actually looking\nA water source for those subdivisions that would really saved us family\nA lot of profit from it has to be a joint effort between the federal government and the state government working together to make sure that we've got checks and balances in place so people aren't sold land or houses that don't have adequate water\nI really feel for that family they invested their entire life savings into that property and now they can't sell it because they don't have water source of water source\nThank you must Marquez Peterson you have thirty seconds if you'd like it\nYou know in the Sierra Vista community this has been so top of mind Joe as you're aware and they'd not pull the housing permanent\nIn a long time so I think having that discussion having that the local and state weigh in on the determination if that subdivision can be approved is key I think again the federal government can provide guidelines but those decisions should be made at the local and the state level\nThank you we have a follow up question of from the wrong hands and what the Arizona Republic let us know if you'd like to\nA remark has ah Peterson or do you accept the science of climate change\nFashion having that the local and state weigh in on the determination if that subdivision can be approved is key I think again the federal government can provide guidelines but those decisions should be made at the local and state level\nThank you we have a follow up question uh from Ron Hansen what the Arizona Republic let us know he'd like to\nA remark has a Peterson or do you accept the science of climate change and if so what are you willing to do to act on that in the\nA body of knowledge from a climate scientist\nI think it's a delicate balance between a growing a company and the environmental regulations that are put in place and not having them overreach uh but I think it is a very delicate balance it must be met\nThank you and miss Kirkpatrick is you have a forty five seconds for this follow up let's go ahead and you hear from the candidates\nAre\nI Believe the science behind climate change or the defense department believes it it's been said it's the biggest existential threat to the planet we should've done something about it Twenty years ago but we really have to do something\nThank you and miss Kirkpatrick you have a forty five seconds for the follow up let's go ahead and you hear from the candidates\nAre\nI Believe he's the science behind climate change um the defense department believes that it's been said it's the biggest existential threat to the planet we should've done something about it Twenty years ago\nBut what you really have to do something now\nWe have to lower fossil fuel emissions and two sons got great face for this because we shouldn't be using alternative energy we shouldn't be the solar capital of the world right here in Tucson Gabby Giffords was working on that\nI Want to pick up that effort because we can do it let's stop using fossil fuel let's convert to alternative energy wind solar natural gas where it makes sense\nThank you were almost half way through the evening part of that is to believe and we are changing topics we now turn our attention to questions related to border security and immigration we begin with a question from Lorraine Rivera for ms Marquez Peterson\nIs Marcus\nWe can do it let's stop using fossil fuel let's convert alternative energies wind solar natural gas where it makes sense\nThank you for almost half way through the evening hoarders that used to believe we are changing topics we now turn or tensions to questions related to border security and immigration we begin with a question from Lorraine Rivera for ms Marquez Peterson\nIs Marcus Peterson should DACA recipients so called dreamers be granted citizenship and if so what do you say to the thousands of immigrants who are currently waiting for their citizenship request to be processed\nI support dreamers are achieving legal status um I did not believe it should include a pathway to citizenship and that we need to focus on immigration reform\nTo me immigration reform means something that's merit base that includes a family\nAnd uh also includes border security I Do support the wall where it makes sense surveillance technology resources increase border patrol I think all of that should be done together is very complex issue but I Do support legal status for dreamers\nI support DACA recipients I support dreamers I had an immigration working group to address immigrate\nMean something that's merit base that includes a family and uh also includes border security I Do support the wall where it makes sense surveillance technology resources increase border patrol I think all of that should be done together is very complex issue now but I Do support legal status for dreamers\nMiss Kirkpatrick I support DACA recipients I support dreamers I had an immigration working group to address immigration reform and I always started mind meeting with testimony from dreamers DACA recipients three or four of them different ones each time\nTheir stories are so emotional\nAnd in so many cases tragic\nThat I thought you know if the Capitol Hill could hear these stories we'd get immigration reform done so\nI introduced legislation to allow dreamers to work on Capitol Hill and I want to do that again\nThank you Steve Goldstein a question for ms ...\nMr Patrick the Latino community we do is not monolithic but as a group they tend to specifically opposed President Trump's plan for a border wall how specific would you be as far as those are the Latino community who see bigotry and the White House how would you try to redress up\nWell let me talk about border security\nSo I introduced legislation to allow dreamers to work on Capitol Hill and I want to do that again\nThank you Steve Goldstein a question for ms Kirkpatrick\nMr Patrick the Latino community we know it's not monolithic but as a group they tend to specifically opposed President Trump's plan for a border wall how specific would you be as far as those in the Latino community who see bigotry in the White House how would you try to redress up\nWell let me talk about border security up the borders only secure when the people who live there feel that it's secure and I know ranchers along the border who feel that the\nPresident's policies are are inflaming issue and you know the policy of separating children from their parents is is a horrible horrible gut wrenching painful policy a black eye on our country for the rest of our history\nI have three grandchildren under the age of three and the fact that they would ever be separated against their will from their parents and put in the hands of a stranger\nI Can't I Can't bear to even think about that I don't know how these families are coping with it we got to stop that policy we've got to pass border policies\nPolicy a black eye on our country for the rest of our history I have three grandchildren under the age of three and the fact that they would ever be separated against their will from their parents and put in the hands of a stranger\nI Can't I Can't bear to even think about that I don't know how these families are coping with it we got to stop that policy we've got to pass border policies that are humane and legal what this isn't the destruction is doing is inhumane and illegal\nMore ... you know I've spent time with sheriff panels of ... county as well as ranchers and not go along the border and I've actually learn I think and has not met was sheriff panels yet but\nThe sheriff and others talked about the fact that drug smuggling in human trafficking is real and it's occurring at our southern border at we need to protect a our families that are along the border I think ... should tell you they have fear related to uh people that might be coming through the desert with guns and other uh terrorism\nTerrorists and others talked about the fact that drug smuggling and human trafficking is real and it's occurring at our southern border at we need to protect a our families that are along the border I think gradually should tell you they have fear related to uh people that might be coming through the desert with guns and other uh terrorism\nThank you our next question is for ... Peterson and it comes from Lorraine Rivera\nYear's tax cut package is expected to add more than one trillion dollars to the national debt\nRepublicans have look to cut future dead mice scaling back spending on program\nThank you our next question is for ms ... Peterson and it comes from Lorraine Rivera\nLast year's tax cut package is expected to add more than one trillion dollars to the national debt\nRepublicans have look to cut future debt by scaling back spending on programs like Medicare and Medicaid do you support cutbacks on those programs or are you willing to accept\nAnd I do not support cuts in Social Security and Medicare um I Believe we've made promises to folks who paid into the system and they need to be honored um in terms of the national debt I think we need a robust economy to build ourselves out of that and the tax and JOBS Act\nHas been very beneficial it's led our economic prosperity that we're seeing in our region the average family and see to receive more than two thousand dollars a year um\nGosh consumer confidence small business confidence is at the highest levels it's been in decades I think it's been very positive and we need to let the robust economy tackle some of the debt issues that we're going to be be facing\nThank you must Kirkpatrick you have thirty seconds\nHas been very beneficial it's led our economic prosperity that we're seeing in our region the average family and CD to receive more than two thousand dollars a year um\nGosh consumer confidence small business confidence is at the highest levels it's been in decades I think it's been very positive and we need to let the robust economy tackle some of the debt issues that we're going to be be facing\nThank you must Kirkpatrick you have thirty seconds if you'd like\nMy opponent supports the massive tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations\nAnd Paul Ryan came to Tucson for her and he said how are we going to pay for it we're going to have to look at Social Security and Medicare believe me under his leadership she will cut Social Security and Medicare I'm endorsed by the committee to protect and preserve\nSocial Security and Medicare and that is because I fight to keep those programs they are not entitlements there are no benefits and our seniors deserve to have and\nThank you our next question is from Steve ... and it is for ms Kirkpatrick Mr country I Want to return to the topic of immigration reform there was on his head many leaders when it comes to that it'd be phrase comprehensive immigration reform used to get tossed around a lot not quite as much now and I'm Wondering\nAnd Medicare and that is because I fight to keep those programs they are not entitlements there are no benefits and our seniors deserve to have and\nThank you our next question is from Steve Goldstein and it is for ms Kirkpatrick Mr country I Want to return to the topic of immigration reform there was on his had many leaders when it comes to that the phrase comprehensive immigration reform used to get tossed around a lot not quite as much now and I'm Wondering going forward do you think of as a possibility you have\nA two main policy but that also includes border security is this Congress ready to do that if you're in the house you have\nOne I I really believe it's possible to do that [noise] ah and you know if we pass comprehensive immigration reform we've ... free up the border patrol to focus on the criminal activity stop the cartels stop the human trafficking stop the drug trafficking\nBut family if you want to come here either to work\nOr to make a lot a better life for their families should have a legal way to do that or it's a it's a top priority when John McCain a ushered through that legislation in two thousand sort Thirteen I thought we haven't done by now I really did a but we're going to push for it until we get it done\nThe cartels stop the human trafficking stop the drug trafficking but family if you want to come here either work\nOr to make a better life for their families should have a legal way to do that uh it's it's a top priority when John McCain a ushered through that legislation in two thousand sort Thirteen I thought we'd have it done by now I really did a but we're going to push for it until we get it done\nLike humans more cars Peterson you have thirty seconds\nYeah and I spoke about immigration reform previously I Do believe we need to tackle this now and regardless of party people know that the system is broken or we need an immigration reform that includes something that's merit based and that includes family\nUm and that includes border security which as I mentioned it and for me includes a wall where it makes sense surveillance increase border patrol\nOr resources for our share of I think it is something we need to tackle again now\nCrucify may you know quick follow up but you can get done I understand what your views are but do you think this Congress is ready to make that happen I've\nAlso been hearing scene generations of bills worked on by Senator McCain or Senator Flake in the past and I do think there's a will to get this done\nMuch Kirkpatrick would you like forty five seconds on the full yes I Would oh one of the things I liked it\nWall where it makes sense surveillance increase border patrol or resources for our share is I think it is something we need attack like an now\nCrucify may you know quick follow up but do you think you can get done I understand what your views are but do you think this Congress was ready to make that happen\nI've also been hearing scene generations of bills worked on by Senator McCain or Senator Flake in the past and I do think there's a will to get this done\nMost Kirkpatrick would you like forty five seconds on the full\nYes I Would uh one of the things I like to do is put together working groups on various issues I talked to about a little bit earlier about my immigration working group I Want to do that again and so it's a way to engage the community to give me good ideas on legislation that we can pass\nI really believe that people who are in the trenches know best\nSo this is very much a an approach that from the bottom up rather than than me and posing my ideas on the constituents here in congressional district too and I look forward to setting up the immigration are we working group but we'll have other working groups on the serious problems that we're facing\nYou we know turned to Joe Ferguson with a question for ms Marquez Peterson who's ... Peterson can you cite any significant areas where you differ from Arthur mix Sally if possible\nRather than me and posing my ideas on the constituents here in congressional district too and I look forward to setting up the immigration working group but we'll have other working groups on the serious problems that we're facing\nThank you we now turn to Joe Ferguson with a question for ms ... Peterson ... Peterson can you fight any significant areas where you differ from earth ... if possible can you name some specific from Martha McSally um\nBeen a a an advocate\nFor terrorists and ... their impact on our small business community and not particular clear on what her role as a matter what her position but I'll tell you it's an area which I've expressed concern to the Trump Administration um we have\nA small businesses within our chamber of commerce that have been dramatically impacted by the steel and aluminum tariffs even when there was a threat to them before they were in place and I made sure to give that perspective and have a seat at the table with the Trump Administration to explain just those dire effects on our businesses as he went through he has to go ... and\nUh so those are areas in which I have differed with the Trump Administration in particular\nThank you ... I see three areas where my opponent a and Martha ... salary agree they both want to privatize social ...\nBefore they were in place and I made sure to give that perspective and have a seat at the
