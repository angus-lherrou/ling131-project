thanks for being here thanks for having me on right now this is so fascinating to think of Shakespeare breaking out of\nWestern culture especially in the East Africa can you first of all tell us about

news in the book the entire time I spent my childhood or off pretending to be here is rather than reading about them a but certainly um since my teen years I've seen a difficulty of Shakespeare and and I went on to\nRead that University in and then teach at Cambridge but it wasn't until I happened upon this project that I managed to connect these two very disparate parts of my life\nNo the subtitle of your book a Shakespeare in Swahili land is in search of a global poet it's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a a hero of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nWell I think a part of the story is about cultural imperialism um it's about\nConnect those two very disparate parts of my life\nNo the subtitle of your book a Shakespeare in Swahili land is in search of a global poet it's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a a hero of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nWell I think a part of the story is a knee about cultural imperialism um it's about a British rate is taking Shakespeare to East Africa as a kind of ... to protect them against the dock consonant\nButs what few people realize that very early on in his history Shakespeare became detached from Britain from being simply a British possession\nOn and it was translated into a wide number of uh of languages\nSo for instance one of the great discoveries in this book was to find that Indians who had taken Shakespeare from British culture back in India but had been proved type it to build the railways in East Africa in the early twentieth century\nHad as extraordinary culture all performance of Shakespeare in Mumbai in nearly twenty century or at one point Shakespeare was being performed a mall in Mumbai southern in London's west that and\nAnd these were you know glorious leave Iraq\nDiscoveries in this book was to find that Indians who had taken Shakespeare from British culture back in India but had been proved type it to build the railways in East Africa in the early twentieth century\nHad is extraordinary culture all performance of Shakespeare in Mumbai so in the early twenty century at one point Shakespeare was being performed a more in Mumbai southern in London's west that and\nAnd these were you know glorious Lee irreverent productions much like Shakespeare's own day you know Shakespeare was that was ... was a man of the state has to do what's necessary to get bums on seats to entertain the audience and these were very much\nShakespeare plays but taken in re made 'em to speak to the people who are performing them in Mumbai in nearly twenty century so I think you know as long as things don't become\nPetrified as long as we you know we didn't put things on a pedestal and insist that they don't change in order to understand them in New ways than setting the Shakespeare cannon has come in in very very different places than the way he originally wrote the place\nThat's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on a real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to entertain themselves and and make life jolly it's another example of it\nAs long as things don't become petrified as long as we you know we didn't put things on a pedestal and insist that they don't change in order to understand them in New ways than setting the Shakespeare cannon has come in in very very different places than the way he originally wrote the place\nNow that's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on a real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to entertain themselves and and make life jolly\nIt's another example of our Shakespeare sort of appeals to people that several levels were these plays when they're used by for instance immigrant laborers from India in East Africa\nAre they adapted to fit the culture or the amped up to be more entertaining or on their level or are they just straight translations of Shakespeare like we would not\nUm no I mean they they are adopted again there's a wonderful twelfth night where instead of being shipped off the coast of Kenya as happens in Shakespeare's play the opening scene sees a train wreck which sweeps the are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and obviously that's going to speak to people\nWho are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know the hamlet settled and move called battlement ... Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation\nThey are adopted again there's a wonderful twelfth night where instead of being shipwreck off the coast of Bohemia as happened in Shakespeare's play the opening scene sees a train wreck which sweeps the are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and obviously that's kind of speak to people\nWho are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know the hamlet federal ... called ... Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation and against spoiler alert here it's anyone who's never see for me and Juliet or instead of stopping herself at the end of the play she uses a poisonous snake\nIn order to kill us which kinda tones are into because that's how again sport or sorry\nUh that's how clear Patrick dollars at the end of Antony and Cleopatra so it's this kind of wonderfully fertile reimagining of the ... and one that pack out houses or the U.S.'s\nWith five hundred people every night of the week and these were corrugated on ... in a fledgling city I'm On bass and you know I think it it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East African cities even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili left in search of a global poet Edward\nOne that pact out houses or the U.S.'s with five hundred people every night of the week and these were corrugated on ... in a fledgling city I'm On bass and you know I think it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East African cities even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature at Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land\nIn search of a global poet Edward is it safe to say\nI mean you're focuses East Africa but would this be\nEast Africa as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and are going to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet\nThey're extraordinary Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia and Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he used as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the explorers he's used by that mission raised to create a written culture of Swahili language\nThat is now a spoken by a hundred million people he's translated into Swahili\nShakespeare traditions in India in Russia and Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he used as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the explorers he's used by that mission raised to create a written culture of Swahili language\nThat is now a spoken by a hundred million people\nHe's translated into Swahili he's you know he performed by these Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flashpoint for talking about the extent to which these countries in the optimum off of colonialism want to be open to the culture of the people who had beaten colonial open ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYeah so Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to but it's one which hopefully capture as a set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda\nParts of the Congo allowing him which Swahili is that the main or one of the major languages this also is the region was governed as a kind of a single entity by the British as a colony so the reason why they speak Swahili is because it's\nSwahili land East Africa\nYeah so Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to but it's one which hopefully captures\nA set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda\nParts of the Congo along the way in which Swahili is that the main or one of the major languages this also is the region was golf and as a kind of a single entity by the British as a colony so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices and mission raised landed\nOn the coast which is west why he has spoken Swahili is kind of very Arabic influenced bend to language and as the colonial governments moved inland and ah they would damned if they were going to speak I learned more than one language so they made everyone else learns what he has they moved in and out of what\nIs just happens to be a convenient language for the Kony overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is the legacy of colonialism but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created to shed culture between all of these are African culture within one of these countries in East Africa [laughter]\nNow you talked about uh the missionaries using Shakespeare's what is it\nWhat is just happens to be a convenient language for the call new overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism so widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is the legacy of ... but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created to shed culture between all of these are African culture within one of these countries in East Africa [laughter] I\nKnow you talked about uh the missionaries using Shakespeare's what is nineteenth century missionaries and checks for having common when it comes to sway\nThe main character in this story is a chest cold ed wood ... who was the the mission ... to Central Africa sent out from Britain\nHe arrives in Zanzibar in Eighteen sixty seven and he is admission ran it's his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity but he sees it as central to listen to create less receive so he actually spends a lot of the time\nTrying to understand local culture is translating Swahili ... into English\nAnd trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili\nHe is a translation of ... and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nThe the locals to Christianity but he sees it as central to listen to create this receive so he actually spent a lot of time trying to understand local culture is translating Swahili ... into English\nAnd trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili he is a translation of channels and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational tax to schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania for almost a century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their faith and in order to do that people had to be literate and missionary tend to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a ... a you believe that won gold has created old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this is great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had access\nTheir culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a ... a you believe that won gold has created to old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this this great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had access to a kind of universal notions of beauty the allowed him to speak disparity pure language of beauty and so the assumption was that wherever you want if you translate to Shakespeare into those languages they would also be able to appreciate\nHave that's one more reason or he could be the global poet he talked to a virtual terms of beauty and love and humanity\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nIt's just\nAny ... Steve\nAnd that was journey for I travel with Rick Steve ... and it can I ask ... Steve [noise]\nThank you [noise] guns on bones they [laughter]\nMore than a decade exploring Iceland and focusing especially on a vibrant music\nAny ... Steve\nAnd that was journey for I travel with Rick Steves ... guys medics [noise]\nThank you [noise] gun bones age [noise]\nMore than a decade exploring Iceland and focusing especially on a cyber music scene [noise] these folks Kevin at a\nTeam from key XP radio in Seattle head to Reykjavik to broadcast live from the Iceland Airwaves music festival\nPool has traveled to each corner the island nation that has made many local friends you stopping their studio now to share his passion for one of the hottest traveled destinations anywhere these days and it's music scene Kevin thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me Rick appreciate that of all places to take a radio crude to broadcast live\nWhy would you choose Iceland and wipe you've gone back for so many years in a row\nOne reason is they have an incredible music scene it's amazing a little history on K XP were a Seattle based radio station with a global audience and we're committed to finding a discovery and great music no matter where it's being created we had been going to music festival\nThanks so much for having me Rick appreciate that of all places to take a radio crude to broadcast live why would you choose Iceland and why be gone back for so many years in a row well\nReason is they have an incredible music scene it's amazing [noise] a little history on K XP were a Seattle based radio station with a global audience and we're committed to finding a discovery in great music no matter where it's being created\nWe had been going to music festivals in the United states like south by southwest in Austin, Texas and see I'm Jay in New York City but uh the first trip to Iceland as a station I really wanted to make a point that ah that Kay XP would travel to the\nFarthest corners of the earth to find a great music to share with our listeners worldwide really you know music is like travel in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power of music and bring people together\nIt helps create a more tolerant an understanding world as we get to have those experiences through music and get to understand each other through\nVarious different types of music and are you've come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place a than sometimes we think it is even when it's far away and there are different dimension\nAll in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power music and bring people together\nIt helps create a more tolerant an understanding world as we get to have those experiences through music and get to understand each other through various different types of music and uh you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place a than sometimes we think it is even when it's far away\nAnd there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use as your entree into a more intimate connection with that culture can be cuisine it can be art it can be music ... and a music certainly it's almost a cliche but it's international language you can sit in a pub in Ireland or\nOr I suppose in a small concert hall and in Reykjavik and feel like you're celebrating the same thing with local people\nAbsolutely and I and I think that's part of what drives K XP and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark sometimes I've been in in traditional music or sessions and Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength ... and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel\nIt's part of what drives key XP and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark sometimes I've been in in traditional music or sessions in Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength ... and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really yeah\nTransformational is is such a great word to describe a when you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and not\nTell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was I wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called secret rose and they uh had an album called\nI'll get to ... that\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this music from where that came yeah I Want to try and\nThis could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called secret rows and they uh had an album called\nI'll get to ... that\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this music from where that came\nYeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listen to some music fair for Greek if I wanted to go to the fjord and look at the view where his cabin was when he was inspired to write that he has a music is sometimes so unfair and you want to be translated it and you\nWant to go to the to the place from where it blossomed yes music and sometimes it inside travel okay so you're organizing the snow in the sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yes so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back [laughter] oh you didn't want to go back because he thought you'd be ruining it ruining it yeah I you know it's so hard to replicate something of Rio knew about it yeah it was I go back with a TV crew and it's really come up\nIn a sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yes so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and\nIt was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back\n[laughter] oh you didn't want to go back because he thought you'd be ruining it ruining ... yeah I I\nYou know it's so hard to replicate something of reality about it yet because I go back with a TV crew\nAnd it's really about what is the magic amateur last year it was incredible do it again yeah and sometimes it does and that so I did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of ice and on my radio show I ended up hooking up with their trade commissioner and
