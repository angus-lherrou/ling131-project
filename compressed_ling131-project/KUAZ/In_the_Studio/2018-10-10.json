to actually kind of have a look at what you do in the next stage maybe\nUh let's see we've got a big mention genders in August uh asked or three years we've actually brought a variations this product to to join common interests with people in the evening [noise]\nSky we combine about way we were in the creation of print that make light of the season three you'll watch in small find video from across the U.S [noise] rewarding you fell to think if you remember with showers ... has seen happening inside rally wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far away\nA variation just try to teach and common interests with people in the evening [noise]\nSo much for months ago we spoke about way we are in the creation of print that make like a C season three you'll watching smoke videos from across the U.S human ... cells I think if you remember with showers war has been happening since then rally ramped up one round of testing and\nI'm so far we've got basically the the entire year of the game developed so it's sort of like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place an hour refining that and trying to make it better and better so it's a it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is and now it's just about making it better so it will be a story sets across the the timescale of the year that's right so each game is a a month\nThat's sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the games kind of reinforce and ending\nThis whole with tens of thousands of people and it will close and some real work will begin what happens tonight tonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that you're in a conference room\nThat's right so each game as a a month that's sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the game kind of reinforce that ending\nSo this whole with tens of thousands of people and it will close and some real work will begin what happens tonight\nTonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that you're in a conference room in a hotel at some secret location or playing through if he's in three and I'll be watching it with a notepad and hand\nReally seeing how the out of the box experience works how their first games work\nAnd I'll be doing that for about twelve hours over the weekend I'm at night it's going to be two couples for player game we recruited them off the Internet using Twitter as people I Do not know I've never met\nGet a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard\nSo you're kind of feel like an old tired and you will know tighten your belt and seeing how much what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible as part of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get ... rich state of being in there and sometimes I Do that as well\nThose people I Do not know I've never met\nGet a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard\nSo you're kind of feel like an old tire you will know taking the old saying how much what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible as part of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get such a rich data being in a room sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be applying the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible\nThere's almost a scientific discipline that you don't want to back the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer that question unless they get really stuck I don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I have to rely on the real fat and this is where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world does he I came all bull to code is going on the late to legacy versions of pandemic\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a book that's full\nCasual and breezy but oddly\nThe real fat and that's where we find out where the halls and the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world does he I came on ... on the late to legacy ...\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then he gets stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a book that's full\nCasual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game as translate into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translate it into a more precise language\nWas asked languages from other countries filtering back in the game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon\nAnd based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nWas asked languages from other countries filtering back in the game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon and put that on a cover you just won't sell it and Germany so it you think of the culture you have to think of the language you have to think of how people played\nSo at least that kind of postal German ... combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games like that [noise] it fit into\nWhat were called German games in the nineties and then Europe games which was this interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of aversion to direct conflict\nThey had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else and said you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically haven't taken anything from you I just prevented you from getting some things\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nTurtle sort of a version to direct conflict\nThey had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically haven't taken anything from you know I just prevented you from getting something\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the post war aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred games developed gemstone [noise] selling gangs of everything you could imagine titles about SPN oh ... ... ... creations of

kind of coming out of the scene that was working on Yahoo and it was the lead interaction designer working a lot of their social I guess what now you'd call social networking applications say something that now is really defining tech coach at you kind of stuff\nYeah I mean back when I was working on this that people didn't want to put their photo op on line because I thought that was being too public a set that we take for granted\nNow or was it was really on the edge when I was working on it and we're just beginning to understand what they like to like making up a gate that you'd share with people and now you know as ubiquitous you see it on Twitter is you know basically ... everywhere but it back in time we were just kind of learning with us interaction patterns we're helping to document those and share those an event wise that's across the author\nOf the defining still coach you know isn't it yeah I mean it's like I said if you've taken it to see it everywhere I mean

I'd really like about tabletop gaming and it's very different from a electronic gaming and that you you're playing with people across the table you're making eye contact it's like this medium for connecting across your dining room table because people an excuse to to be with each other and that that is one thing I really love [noise]\nWhat's the importance of this time away from screens that game's about yours allow\nBut I think the devices are really isolating you know when you're on your eye patter your honor X. box or whatever but they they forget to connect with people themselves
