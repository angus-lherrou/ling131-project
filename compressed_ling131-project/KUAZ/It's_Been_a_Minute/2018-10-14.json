in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the billions of\nHuman animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realize that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about or spoken about truly

[noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially ... changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nAnd that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal movement is the

transformation of an entity from a thing to a person [noise] nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa she survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and after he got\nJames decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because an Eighteen century slave one of the major responsible is the Godfather's was to help you escaped\nKidnap from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart broad James Somerset to London and after he got\nThere James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptize because he wanted to get a set of God parents because of an Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility to Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring him to shift the anti marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law written the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily lips\nWell now James is God parents swung into action they approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law written the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat\nBecause of James summer said was a legal thing he was not eligible for a rid of heaviest corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should the writ of habeas corpus and James his body was brought in\nBy the captain the ship there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as long as concerned they had nothing what\nJames his body was brought in\nBy the captain the ship or a series of hearings of the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in order to James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walk dead but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that's of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James how much time we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the non human animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal\nAbout the

elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make it voluntary once you've sent out\nTen thousand lettuce to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nThose who were still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaire has club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime ... to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely\nWe're still interested in that you do a second random selection as I was interested in making sure you actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be\nSo completely different uh but so much better from my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason then you add limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nIs a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John as some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams says yeah this is famous cut by ... Adams saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people\nPart of a government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John out of some people\nI'm not tonight I'm Sorry I'm hitchhikers guide to the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams is that what is it is a famous cut by ... Adams saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one day like the chamber in one solution chamber once will titian buddy\nI Would of course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first uh how many in the world to\nInstigate a one elected chamber in one saw titian chamber institution buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber uh this is a path to old is the ideal\nSelection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these parliaments tried to society of friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nWe don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these\nPolitics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware\nThat it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament's tried to say to your friends oh I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nRely jerky what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling thoughts\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nWe have our strategy or and that is yet to to get these students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting\nAnd the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is this something that can really spread out on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have out strategy a and that is yet to to get the ... assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost\nA million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe it'll spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with the second buddies selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge ... on the hill battle is to try to convince\nPeople and then entrenched powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not ... I think it will be easy to political change is never easy uh especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh\nWith a second buddies selected by soap dish and that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a hugely ill battle is to try to convince\nPeople and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes ah yeah it ... it I'm not ... I think it will be easy to political changes ... seats are especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate on to try something new I think have systems broke two unknown to see a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is ... he's a legal advocate\nThis last year in ...\nDemocracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas about hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law because\nOf a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is be back tomorrow he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher you're getting ... us who has this book between facts and norms and he says\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat do we open another wherever we want to go together in law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as a kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between faction norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there is a huge get oftentimes people who need those rules the most\nThem into actual rules and institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between facts and norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there is a huge get oftentimes people who need those rules the most have never even heard of them and um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nOr both\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law\nTo the people\nHere you see like Mario on the head stage [noise]\nI Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none the\nRubbish from a community of hurts people included out on the western coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nI Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none to\nRelease from a community of hurts people included up on the western coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company billed to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia is got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company has violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers ... mustache and everything he wears really says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nHas appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\nHe said the company ignored every one of those letters\nAnd everything he wears really said that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nHas appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[noise] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing them to decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory with a bucket of petrol in his hands intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it\nThe un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Tucson", "day": "14"}
