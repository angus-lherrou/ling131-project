to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call Monica cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late nineteenth early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest their second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of

tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\n'cause all who can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like\nOils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many ... corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked

bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert\nStore bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended

to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed by the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got

[noise] me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you [noise]\nGet any like what you were saying earlier a lot of it has to do with with the fact that they we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this can go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it to ... you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what\nAnd go if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really

everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need to everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people can look to and say okay well you know these books you are a food to eat like I think of ... men and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or\nA few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have\nLabels and you know of the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because at a broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then\nPaul VI V. six vegan before six or\nA few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever\nBut I you know

drink no we're always somewhere in certain environments in certain states of mind\nOn a mental state and the environment both together that kind of impact what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it and we saw in a way some\nMyths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\nAnd put some of the pleasure into what we think about food\n[noise] in fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good if you're a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll break has brought me everything else the thousands of single the smell of assaulting see on the walls of the songs on our backs all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing inside a in the dishes they are\nSo that he that too much than style restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition and star restaurant\nA white table cloths\nThere's no room table was no glasses and I play nothing\nThey never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll bring has brought me everything else the thousands of the ... the smell of a salty sea and the walls of the ... all of that is play against the experience and top chef capturing that in ... in the dishes like so\nSo that he that too much than style restaurant in the bay in Switzerland when he got his tuition and star restaurant\nA white table cloths\nThere's no ... on the table was no glasses or in a place and then nothing it's just a plastic car people wait and see what he told us we're seven o'clock hour here and everyone's here in the restaurant and I can see what will tables full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up furiously that plastic how\nI Wonder if they get up you know there is a little one euro tower and it makes it moving sound and sort of some of the first table that there'll be laughing and then you can guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving car was laughing Dina's and that\nIs the moment when it first comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table enhanced the mood and he knows that will improve even the taste of a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise] [noise] wow so like from from a neurological perspective\nDo we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case [noise] uh no so\nYou have the whole restaurant full of moving higher was laughing ... and that is the moment when it first comes out because then he has successfully nothing more than one euro table enhanced the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise] [noise] wow so it's like from from a neurological perspective\nDo we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case [noise]\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with a young chef which is if you have here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending our question as several weeks have to be living his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced that comes remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they don't have the experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details I think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talk to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say and this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was talking\nRemember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they remember the experience but I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say and this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School it is just the sourcing the preparation but nothing else but\nHe says their case or I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food we near plastic cutlery nah as a silver and that and what does your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking out at night job so they the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly\nYou can never sort of food just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment there's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided\n[noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now pumping up starting their own Venus who who are really thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were swimming [noise]\nTrust\nBy itself it's always of on something in a certain environment\nThere's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly

book is called the perfect meal you\nCan see his entire talk at Ted that NPR outdoors\nSo let's get shifted a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's what ... does okay my
