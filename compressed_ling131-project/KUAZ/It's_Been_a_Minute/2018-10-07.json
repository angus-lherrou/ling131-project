I think that's that's the science\nFiction Association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with\nThings that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of coronary heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nWould that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a in a way to make a child more resilient to pain or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right I think they will I think\nAnd as those lists continue to grow [noise]\nWe now have a technology that could in theory\n[noise] allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that that technology is a promising like if there was a you know way to make a child more resilient to pan or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what ... delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity we might assume\nGenetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what ... delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but\nAnd for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes UCR five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but I mean\nI mean a part of me wonders\nShould we be giving that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a ...\nGiving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean a part of me wanders\nSweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children\nAnd so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution you know\nSaying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it ...\nNow we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual but that individuals children and their children and their children and their children\nAnd so that's where I think you have this very rainy issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nWere being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things

selection that he quips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack hair so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just sad and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out\nFabricated over millions of

Steven can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\n[noise] [noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nWas Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology\nOr whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're

then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the flight then some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature is that if we were blind place we can perfect mankind the angel dreaming\nPolitical reasons why people have found congenial foremost is but ah if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because zero equals zero equals zero but if something is written on the slate then some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature is that uh\nIf we were blank slates we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species to social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instincts and perhaps some of them can Dennis To selfishness prejudice and violence\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone
