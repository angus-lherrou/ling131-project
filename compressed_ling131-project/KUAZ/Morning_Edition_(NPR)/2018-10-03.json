introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted to do but Francis Arnold appalled that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the

a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen those to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world well

sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is

the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to

him of partisan rhetoric John round off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly know\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing the justice for political reasons\nThat leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth or Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries

President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so on broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone has some of us receive alerts already\nCommon to

presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having a testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the public\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her to think that the president might be using such a shift them for political purposes or to create a

or to create a diversion if he felt the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concerns here I I Will be some length about it but these are not our is that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing the system known as wireless emergency alerts George W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and it wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFEMA says that accusation is baseless in the background\nKnown as wireless emergency

to let you know from the Washington DC shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not going to do it verbatim translate oh no I don't know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California\nAnd the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzymes to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into\n... by you know using logic and trying to design right that enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nPutting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme\nThen you could screen those to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display uses the virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to the antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world well you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process I mean you know enzymes\nIncluding anti bodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you could you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer we heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z\nOr ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price deal yeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel\nIt targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you
