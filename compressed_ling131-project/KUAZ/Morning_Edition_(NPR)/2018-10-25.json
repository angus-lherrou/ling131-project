thirty percent drop for China's stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\nWith China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt Sparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as\nBig an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give

dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and start managing its currency like this the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy

of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war\nAnd that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up thanks\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U.S China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain that technology behind crypto currency is like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about ... but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he can help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nWays led agriculture\nCarpets oils frustration\nPower sometime in ... chain coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about ...

number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nAnd then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change

blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype we need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully because as luxury and could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air\nKatherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block chain will be some kind of

you doing to I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday\nYou know I'm not sure it means anything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here it was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically the channeling of money from a one source\nUm to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nA Nike or those those uh operations as guy\nAs I can remember and that is basically the channeling of money

the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the ... universes were being defrauded 'em by this system\nAh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible\nUnder NCWA rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play

U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit it kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with

these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype we need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about

sufficient water and Lake Mead to satisfy everyone the drought contingency plan is an effort on the part of all of the stakeholders\nTo try to figure out a way so that there aren't any big losers so that everybody will share and the shortage a little bit\nAnd all the eight the need for the secretary to come in and just dictate what happens I don't know that the Arizona stakeholders are going to

out a way so that there aren't any big losers so that everybody will share in the shortage a little bit\nAnd Avi ate the need for the secretary to come in and just dictate what happens\nI don't know that the Arizona stakeholders are going to be able to get together and reach an agreement on that if we aren't able to reach that kind of an agreement that we won't have federal legislation to take the place of the secretaries or own a decision making authority and\nUh so we may have to live with the consequences of that and given the state of civil law Arizona is the first of the states to suffer and as a result it could be pretty difficult\nFor Arizona ... especially starting with Arizona agriculture I think the cities don't have anything to worry about for quite a while but once the water is gone\nUh and that's a that's a disaster and enough itself because so much food and and uh fibers grown in the state but ah if that goes first or the next is our is our municipal water supply

the water is gone\nUh and that's a that's a disaster and enough itself because so much food and a fibers grown in the state but ah if that goes first or the next is our is our municipal water supply and\nSo it behooves us all to try to find a way to reach the compromises so that we can all sharing the shortage to some extent so that nobody has to lose totally\nIt really sounds like this is a case of the locals the people on the ground know best about their needs let's not leave that to one person in the in the nation's capital to say\nThat that's what one would hope for and by the way this is not a partisan issue it's more a matter of uh where you are on the not the food chain but the water chain if you're in the city while you're in pretty good position if you're a farmer you're sitting right on the edge and obviously you're concerned and our Indian tribes are involved in this as well as are others\nThe president has also been working to re do what we all commonly no as NAFTA has a

working to redo what we'll commonly no is NAFTA has a new name now a and is also dealing with tariffs increasing a with China\nHow does that affect the Arizona and is there anything you as a senator need to do to step in to protect the Arizona in either those scenario it can affect\nUs and there are some things yes the renegotiation of what we think of as NAFTA produced in agreement it's quite a bit like the old NAFTA and suppliers Arizona is concerned there are some changes\nSome for the better some not\nFor the better um but in terms of Arizona commerce with Mexico and Canada which is significant uh it's it should not be\nA dramatically affected by this by this renegotiation and that's important because Mexico is our biggest trading partner it's enormously important for jobs right here in the state of Arizona\nOr what we can do about the agreement that wasn't it\nSome changes some for the better some not for the better\nUm but in terms of Arizona commerce with Mexico and Canada which is significant uh it's it should not be a dramatically affected by this by this renegotiation and that's important because Mexico is our biggest trading partner it's enormously important for

the Senate to try to do that again this doesn't affect their zone of so much as it does commerce in the United states generally but we're going to try to make some changes to what has been agreed to
