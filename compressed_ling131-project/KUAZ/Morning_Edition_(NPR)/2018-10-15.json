the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes full on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted\nAnd uh we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably are global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the store to the sealer but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen or Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements and the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nasty and the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas in kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nUh we don't like any options on the table this the twenty five percent\nUnder threat will very concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell we don't like the options on the table\nThis is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people\nThat you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you\nState of the obvious as a state that voted for president that has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nOr [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSet up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means you can decade or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes uh and and he told us he understood exactly that this would this district mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that that's a federal law right\nAs a federal in Nineteen sixty four Congress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced they can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've gotta\nFor the non geographically minded right across right across the river\nYes ah in and he told us he understood exactly that this would this district mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that that's a federal law right is a federal in Nineteen sixty four Congress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some\nProduction overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here\nIn America if you want to sell you better make jak\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from a price standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generation ferret\nGregory Kentucky distillers association\nWe turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane

they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's

it will be the divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for

could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans and what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party former house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose\nEven if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him the Republican Party\nSomething else will happen if Republicans lose big in

Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval of course he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election is we're dedicated luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan in nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a design\nAnd acted to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is\nIt's tribally nature partisan in nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when\nYou try to get him to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nI mean in a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when\nYou try to get him to talk about Trump is more or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end no I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal in more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McCain top and thanks so much for coming in they\nTraits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay call and thanks so much for coming in thank you\nSupport also comes from true Concord voices and orchestra presenting northern lights\nThe coral music Scandinavia and the Baltics\nIn three concerts from October Nineteen through the twenty first led by guest conductor Dale more land Venus and more information is that true Concord down on once a dominant retail chain Sears has filed for chapter ... chapter eleven bankruptcy protection will your that report just ahead\nDisease NPR eighty nine point one K.

place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export\nKentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the

starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen or Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements and the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements they well a ... in the EU agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas in kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nUh we don't like any options on the table this the twenty five percent\nUnder threat will very concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term

does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nWe don't like the options on the table this the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer in and hopefully you have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious this is a
