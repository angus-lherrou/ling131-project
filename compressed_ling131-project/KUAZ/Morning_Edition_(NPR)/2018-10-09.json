big surprise do we know wind Nikki Haley stepping aside well\nWe're only hearing um bits and pieces of their announcement right now I'm ... but I Will say that\nYou know Haley has been spending a lot of less time at the Security Council except for this past month of course which was the big U.N General assembly which has been doing more speeches more parents elsewhere she already seemed to have been not long for the job\nI'm and she seemed to be kind of\nTrying to keep her her own um\nImage or own a sense of who she is and and as a politician I'm not completely tied to Donald Trump\nThat's interesting so although this may seem like big news for people um for people who cover diplomacy it's maybe not the most surprising news well I had been\nElsewhere she already seemed to have been not long for the job I'm and she seemed to be kind of trying to keep her her own um image or own a sense of who she is and and as a politician I'm not completely tied to Donald Trump\nThat's interesting so although this may seem like big news for people for people who cover diplomacy it's maybe not the most surprising news\nWell I had been hearing rumblings or a while ago that she was kind of not long for the job and we're in what were you hearing from President Trump today is that he told that she told them six months ago that she wanted to take some time off at the end of after two years in office um he\nIs quoted as saying that he hopes Haley will come back in a different role he says you can take your pick and so far Haley you know isn't really pushing him aside or criticize him or

really pushing him aside or criticize him or anything to the contrary she saying that\nOther countries may not like what the us is does but they respected so again she she kind of keeps her distance from Trump but also supports them\nLet's put her in the in the broader context of this administration which has been critical of the United nations on on several fronts how successful has she been at articulating the president's policies and what do people at the un think of her\nYou know she is very tough and she went in a very tough saying things like we're going to take names of people who support us and who don't I'm On the other hand you know she has supported continued payments to most un bodies um\nYou know she wants to do things like a cut back on the amount of money that the U.S is paying but when you know the rubber hits the road she has been supportive of a lot of of things going on at the un\nAnd I think the un secretary general uh has had a very good relationship with her
