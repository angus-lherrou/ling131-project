voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this

King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about our politics and government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how was the last changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote of white citizens' based barriers to voter registration\nBasic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood\nBut then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration and as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote a by the late Nineteen early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the POWs were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but\nThen an Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration and as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote\nBy the late Nineteen the early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nAnd what about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course black men were given the right to vote in the fifties amendment and Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively stripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineties amendment in Nineteen twenty\nBut you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registrars had frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nOr we have a couple of questions about current controversies my name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a ...\nAnd black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment and Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registrars had frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... men from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge the voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about refusing himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place was a proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy paying their chart and I live in Omaha Nebraska when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nThen I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote well they\nDo they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy payment tour and I live in Omaha Nebraska\nWhen I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office addressed how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require a current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and ... the irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned about their
