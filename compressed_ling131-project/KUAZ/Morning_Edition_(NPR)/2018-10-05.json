that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily not not necessarily yes over the weekend final say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has gotta be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne

he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil

you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their sides\nAt but don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for the\nUh matters that he wanted to advance whether it's

during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's the appointment\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's

their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assault and sexual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot\nElevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime\nRight they have not been found and what what they're saying hits it one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in
