maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have her now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung

eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which badger says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a

the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible is met\nSo people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what

year's Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine will be given to two scientists who's discoveries have led to a revolution in cancer treatment\nThat nobody on the family of five to ... the two thousand a Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine join the to James on this phone how school on June\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris Corning Richard good morning so who are these two winters\nWell the prices being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and by ... at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years a Nobel Prize comes with a complete surprise but not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly OK so\nNot such a big shock of but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer so they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of\nHere's a Nobel Prize comes it's a complete surprise but not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly OK so\nNot such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties he was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells and they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective in attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution in cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning this word ...\nHow do you have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response and he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd won and\nAnd today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning this word ... how do\nYou have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called key true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer ...\nWell before the scientist made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer\nHow did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about ...\nWell before the so I just made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and this whole world of immunotherapy is no really the driving force behind drug development\nThese right I mean we hear a lot about him you know therapy how effective are these new therapies that's one really wants to know\nAnd that's an evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nAre researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of cancer research but clearly there's a lot more to\nThat or a piece of failed and some people had remarkable recoveries or remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint
