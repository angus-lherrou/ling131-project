the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIO Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nWallach agrees she's director of global\nSo it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal but to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more ...\nWould eliminate rules permitting companies

the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic\nDrugs that could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists Chad ... is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nHe says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules but down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe\nThere are some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely

automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build up mobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd then he says could offset some of the labor games from the deal ...

French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a tricked pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development at the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal is it to see Strickland to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics\nWell this is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in ...\nEarly on in the development of the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then they sort of got brighter and brighter and then they stalled out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that helped them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal as it to see Strickland to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics well\nThis is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so Donald Strickland was asked about this in the press conference and even she seem a bit surprised by that\nFact you are the second woman ever getting that no prize in physics often not coming from that\nI thought okay I might have been\nFun but it is true yeah there's only been to others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen Ninety three and there are many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked\nDoes surprise does this suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nI'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant or in the heart scientists especially\nLet's get comments on that\nOkay I I think\nIt is true yeah there's only been a few others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen Ninety three and there have been many good female physicists who has been widely held were overlooked\nDoes surprise does this suggest a an advancement for women physicists\nI'd say it's more like the Nobel Prize is trying to stay relevant in the heart scientists especially ah Internet entrepreneur and started this new age we're in have started giving their own prices\nThis year one of those prices went to a woman named Jocelyn bell burnout who had herself and overlooked for a Nobel Prize that prize was first three million dollars the Nobel or just for around a million new so you know I think the Nobel Prizes are falling behind the times and they recognize that and\nThat's really interesting okay there's a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe can is his name Bell Labs in New Jersey the place where he did much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nAre actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which is light to hold physical things objects wow and that actually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nThe times and they recognize that and that's really interesting okay there is a third Nobel Prize winner Arthur Ashe skin is his name Bell Labs and New Jersey the place where he did a much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nThey are actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which is light tumbled physical things objects wow and that actually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nIf you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're having an individual Adams even wow and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWell the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also in physics it's used pretty widely\nUm and then the lasers are the main sort of public use most common uses laser eye surgery are pulse simplification gets used to and laser eye surgery on this day changed the lives of many people over the last\nMany years fortunately not mine so the glass okay All right Jeff thanks very much for your ah twenty twenty vision on the Nobel Prize in physics [noise] no from NPR's Geoff Brumfiel right here on Monday\nThings like that and also in physics it's used pretty widely um and then the lasers are the main sort of public use most common uses laser eye
