everything in his house is gilded but I don't think that's quite what you mean by that yeah well\nListen I mean I tried to pick a controversial title I knew that the um the people on the on the left side of the political ledger\nWould be upset with that title because Mr Trump has a gilded toilet and um\nThe apartment looks like Louis the fourteenth smoke crystal meth and then decorated the apartment so I knew that would upset them by some footage and ... yes yeah but I but I but I I titled it that way because I grew up in a blue collar neighborhood I have blue collar parents that never went to college and\nMy dad had an hourly workers job when he got started in his career and and the people that I grew up with a really like him and they support him even to this day and so\nI think

important voice because the people on the other side of the aisle and don't like him I Would suggest that they read the book\nSo that they could get some sense for\nWhy he's at forty seven percent and

U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from the\nOther side that are acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he has threatened to run and now in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's higher than a run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the word threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah and that sort of go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but ah\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice\nGeorge about the word threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatened yeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party\nIt was a threatening to run that's how I describe it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president it was sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution among something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle\nYou know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning\nJournalist interviews because I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side in that always understanding the other side's ideas\nMade a person sharper and and by the way if I got to the other side in it weakens my argument\nMe I'm I Love coming on NPR all go on left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning\nJournalists interviews because I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lotta time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas\nMade a person sharper and and by the way if I got to the other side and it weakens my argument\nThat I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing\nFrom well and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is the communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive I hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must\n[noise] to convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nNo no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know\nLike if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there was to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know and that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody we did so it it's out there was a ... page plan that\nThat power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so

plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press\nAnd servicing all parts of the press who didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call and CNN had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I wanted to send a message to those people that hey we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I built my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the square on it though I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous in band and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nThey're back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I built my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the square on that though I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I would've been happy to do 'cause I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality\nOr does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ... having you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on the on that list\nBut it's not going to like me any more than he likes the price of oil and your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean\nI get the sense that the president just didn't agree with that [noise] um no\nActually ... you know ... there's a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have\nBe somewhat of friction points for him to even be on the on that list but this is my guide right on his back and like me any more than he likes to present in all your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press he could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just\nDidn't agree with that [noise] um no\nActually ... you know ... is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I'd been announces ... director is over it's him and I alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI Lived in a while you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media first of all you're gonna lose that war\nSecondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well were you way better served if we dial that down or any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in\nDeclared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for going to lose that war\nSecondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well you way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with Leslie stall let him\nHave a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also\nA lot of people that don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president so there was a lot of people inside the calm seems like okay we got to protect the president from him telling these like mala props and him telling these\nStories that were on average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is uh\nWhat happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people that don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's so there's a lot of people inside the calm seems like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like Mao props and him telling these\nStories that were on an average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On saying inaccurately\nAnd and clearly in consistently over ... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like they they really want them all day and night and so and they're calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energize and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we had to do then is you got to tell him straight if a man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to this\nBuddy energize and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John

base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States is going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people that don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some

credit US Senator Heidi Heitkamp went in twenty twelve for the U.S Senate seat of North Dakota to the Native American vote where she won with\nLess than three thousand votes and I can tell you here on Standing Rock on the north Dakota side we have twenty seven hundred eligible voters Eighteen and above um that are capable of voting in this election\n'em in twenty fourteen twelve hundred people on Standing Rock voted and so that tells you right there that if just one tribal nation alone um votes predominantly with one party that could swing an election\n[noise] so what are you trying to do to get trouble citizen voters eligible for this upcoming election given this Supreme Court decision\nSo so do based on the the new law that North Dakota\nFull of voting in this election 'em in twenty fourteen twelve hundred people on Standing Rock voted and so that tells you right there that if just one tribal nation alone um votes predominantly with one party that could swing an election\nSo what are you trying to do to get trouble citizen voters eligible for this upcoming election given this Supreme Court decision\nYeah so so do based on the the new law that North Dakota\nReally imposed upon the tribal nations is we have to make sure that everyone has identification\nWith their new residential physical address so that\nEntails either getting them a new ID cards that's issued by the tribal government here or we have to provide them supplemental material um whether that's a letter from the travel agency and you know tell them they need to bring a utility bill let them if they're going to use their old id um\nAnd also making sure people do know their residential address because again like I said people I'm here on the reservation house numbers are not very common a joke that my grandmother was saying is that she actually did a permanent marker and and marked her own house with her own numbers so there you go\n[noise] the Republican controlled state government in North Dakota\nYou know tell them they need to bring a utility bill let them if they're going to use their old id um\nAnd also making sure people do know their residential address because again like I said people I'm here on the reservation health numbers are not very common a joke that my grandmother was saying is that she actually get a permanent marker and and marked her own house with her own numbers so there you go\n[noise] the Republican controlled state government in North Dakota says this law is about preventing voter fraud or in the city which is over or one of the easier states to vote and what do you say that\nI think that's comical because you ... as people now making up their own addresses a because they do not feel like they should go to the sheriff who is also are nine one one coordinator and the only person in Sioux county who can issue an address so they're making up their own um addresses right now which\nIs voter fraud so they just created a problem basically and how\nLong do people have to come up with a new address in order to vote this election day yeah so they they have two weeks they can do this right up until election day correct yep uh-huh so do you think that they will do you think you're going to get enough people registered to vote so that they all can have their voices\nAnd the only person in Sioux county who can issue and address so they're making up their own um addresses right now which is voter fraud so they just created a problem basically\nAnd how long do people have to come up with a a new address in order to vote this election day yeah so they they have two weeks they can do this right up until election day correct yep uh-huh so do you think that they will do you think you're going to get enough people registered to vote so that they all can have their voices heard\nUh yeah so we we have the same day registration and the state of North Dakota so we can have people um\nHe also talks about seven states forever it's are

Republicans who have voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act or making promises that they will continue one of the most popular parts of the law making sure people with pre existing conditions are able to get and keep their health insurance\nThe Affordable CARE Act is still at risk of being dismantled but a majority of voters wants to protect coverage for pre existing conditions\nJoining us now is Julie Rovner who is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news Hi Julie\nHey Jeremy and let's step back a bit first before the Affordable CARE Act was passed in ... and who did and who did not have protections for pre existing conditions well\nIf you were going from job to job if you add employer provided insurance then you had protections for pre existing condition or either

news ... hey Jeremy and let's step back a bit first before the Affordable CARE Act was passed in ... and who did and who did not have protections for pre existing conditions well\nIf you go from job to job if you're an employer provided insurance then you had protections for pre existing condition or either exclusions are being charge more as long as he didn't have a break of more than sixty three days that was a Nineteen Ninety six law that Congress passed\nWhat the Affordable Care act did was that extended it to people who basically left their jobs for their own insurance who wanted to leave to start a business or who were people who work for themselves or or kids graduating from college and going off their parents' plan\nThe idea was that people should be able to get insurance regardless of whether they had a pre existing condition and they shouldn't have to pay more for those were the two most important pieces of the pre existing condition protections in the Affordable CARE Act but\nBack ... if you did leave your job and you did leave your health insurance for a period of time and you did have a pre existing condition diabetes cancer or whatever it may be what does that mean for you could you get insurance\nOr possibly not or you might have been able to get insurance but it would cost much more or you might have been able to\nAnd they shouldn't have to pay more for those were the two most important pieces of the pre existing condition protections in the Affordable CARE Act but\nBack ... if you did leave your job and you did leave your health insurance for a period of time and you did have a pre existing condition diabetes cancer or whatever it may be what does that mean for you could you get insurance\nUp possibly not or you might have been able to get insurance but it would cost much more or you might have been able to get insurance but it wouldn't cover your pre existing condition so there were there were a lot of sort of pitfalls if you were trying to buy your own insurance and you had been basically treated for a medical condition sometimes as minor as acne\nSo at this point with some of the dismantling that has been done of the Affordable CARE Act that pre existing condition protection is still in place right ... basically if you want health insurance no matter what your pre existing condition is in this country you can get it\nIt is a it is still in place however there is a lawsuit that is pending we're expecting to hear from the judge in Texas [noise] pretty much any time or the lawsuit suggests that because of the tax bill last year that took away the fine for people who don't have health insurance\nThe entire Affordable Care act is now unconstitutional should be struck down the Trump Administration argued that they didn't quite\nAnd is still in place right basically if you want health insurance no matter what your pre existing condition is in this country you can get it\nIt is it is still in place however there is a lawsuit that is pending we're expecting to hear from the judge in Texas [noise] pretty much any time or the lawsuit suggests that because of the tax bill last year that took away the fine for people who don't have health insurance\nThe entire Affordable Care act is now unconstitutional should be struck down the Trump Administration argued that they didn't quite agree with striking down the whole uh forego Carrick but maybe they should strike down the pre existing condition protection so even though Congress didn't change it there is still some threat that it could be changed in the court\nWill that brings us to the bigger picture here which is that how can you say that you want to keep that one popular provision of the Affordable CARE Act which is the production for pre existing conditions but you want to get rid of other key provisions does it work if you take little pieces of it away\nWell it it makes it difficult I mean that's basically what the Trump Administration is arguing that the insurance industry said we can't afford to cover people with health problems unless we have a bigger pool of healthy people that's what that tax with about that's why there was an individual mandate the individual mandate is now gone and there is still some concern\nThat only ... people will sign up for individual\nFor pre existing conditions but you want to get rid of other key provisions does it work if you take little pieces of it away well\nIt it makes it difficult I mean that's basically what the Trump Administration is arguing that the insurance industry that we can't afford to cover people with health problems unless we have a bigger pool of healthy people that's what that tax with about that's why there was an individual mandate the individual mandate is now gone and there is still some concern\nThat only sick people will sign up for individual health coverage because it's expensive or the insurance companies appear to be betting that they're going to continue to hang on to at least they all the people that they have because they're not raising premiums a whole lot for next year or we will see if that pays off we will know more about that in twenty Nineteen about how well that actually\nWorks meanwhile let's listen to what President Trump has been saying a here he is on the campaign trail at a rally in West Virginia last month\nAnd I will always fight for\nPatients with pre existing conditions or you have to [noise]\n\nPeople think that's not a Republican thing to do I don't care and I'll tell you what all of the Republicans are coming into that\nUh here he is on the campaign trail at a rally in West Virginia last month\nAnd I will always fight for\nPatients with pre existing conditions or you have to [noise]\n\nSome people think that's not a Republican thing to do I don't care and I'll tell you what all of the Republicans are coming into that position now all of them [noise]\nPreexisting conditions are safe [noise] Julie is he right that all of the Republicans are moving into that position at this point\nWell a lot of them are saying it but there are what they have done suggests otherwise and actually just yesterday the Trump Administration um put out a guidance that allows states to\nTake these are short term plans that don't necessarily cover pre existing conditions and let people get subsidies for them under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhich is not something that protects preexisting conditions it basically says that OK sick people you're going to be segregated into these other plans in their premiums are likely to go up so it's in what they say and what they do do not match this year we will see whether voters concerts\nPut out a guidance that allows states to take these are short term plants that don't

sick people you're going to be segregated into these other plans and the premiums are likely to go up so it's in what they say and what they do do not match this year we will see whether voters can sort that out [noise]\nWhat about the Affordable CARE Act overall is it likely that if Republicans keep control of both houses of Congress that they're going to try again to repeal the whole thing\nI think that would be likely I think there are some there was some talk that they might try to do it in the lame duck session after the election that seems unlikely because they're going to have the same Congress they had before when they didn't have the votes but if they were to pick up seats particularly in the Senate\nThen I think you would probably see another effort to to do what Congress tried and failed to do and twenty Seventeen\nOther than the pre existing conditions part of the Affordable CARE Act what are the other really popular parts of the law that it would be difficult for Republicans to get rid of\nWell Republicans tried to go after the Medicaid expansion um and that turned out to be surprisingly unpopular I mean who I I don't think I would've guessed in twenty Fifteen that Medicaid\nBut if they were to pick up seats particularly in the Senate then I think you would probably see another effort to to do what Congress tried and failed to do and twenty Seventeen\nOther than the pre existing conditions part of the Affordable CARE Act what are the other really popular parts of the law that it would be difficult for Republicans to get rid of\nWell Republicans tried to go after the Medicaid expansion um and that turned out to be surprisingly unpopular I mean who I I don't think I would've guessed in twenty Fifteen that Medicaid would become a big political issue and yet we have medicate now on the ballot in four states\nI'm about either expanding or protecting an existing expansion so that the popularity of the Medicaid expansion which gave a health insurance to\nTo you know many millions of people probably around fourteen or Fifteen million people is proving to be popular also so there are other pieces of the Affordable CARE Act that the public likes a lot in fact the only thing that public really didn't like was that individual mandate penalty which Congress got rid of last year\nRight but the question is again whether the the whole thing can stand up if you take away that part of it I guess it has so far\nIt has so far that tried in the insurance company behavior suggest that it it will be or they're betting that it will be okay we will have to see what happens in the court\nThe sign up period for a sea health plan starts on November ...\nSo there are other pieces of the Affordable CARE Act that the public likes a lot in fact the only thing

part of it I guess it has so far\nIt has so far that's right in the insurance company behavior suggest that it it will be are they are betting that it will be okay we will have to see what happens in the court\nThe sign up period for a sea health plan starts on November first and for the first time since twenty tend the price of health coverage through the federal marketplaces is down slightly what's going on there\nA well what's that what's going on there is an insurance companies raise their rates so much last year for twenty Eighteen\nThat they have no place else to go they're finally starting to make money so they don't really need to raise rates a in some cases they're lowering rates at least slightly um partly that's because under the Affordable CARE Act they're not allowed to raise rates unless they can justify the rate increases which they can't this year\nAnd the whole thing and it looks like you know there's a little bit of stability but I should point out it depends where you live\nI'm rates are higher in some places still than in other places sometimes that's because last year's rates didn't go up so much I Would also point out that in some states open enrollment has already started in California started October fifteenth\nSo you really need to to check your state to find out\nPartly that's because under the Affordable CARE Act they're not allowed

like\nWhat are you hearing from Democrats as we lived up to the election are you hearing people talk about universal health care as they were a couple of years ago well\nDemocrats are going to have a really big fight I think after the midterm right now they're talking about protecting preexisting conditions um but there is this this sort of nasons and growing move for a Medicare for all or some kind of universal coverage\nIt's a phrase that means different things different people but clearly the Affordable CARE Act while it expanded coverage through a lot of people did not do enough about uh doing something about the price of health insurance and the price of health care in general\nAnd the fact that the U.S pays way more than other industrialized countries and I think that's going to be

forward Democrats are going to have to decide whether they want to support and more government run a health plan or whether they can figure out a way to to make the Affordable CARE Act more robust and
