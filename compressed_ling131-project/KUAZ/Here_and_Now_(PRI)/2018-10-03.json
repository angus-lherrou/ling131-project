gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how this story fits into the moment\n[noise] a shore so part of what happens is that women are told on as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational um and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me\nUm and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life because I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institution\nAs many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nAnd I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me\nUm and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life because I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman saw and be a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that my anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job are showing up are offering\nQuality lectures are material or material but that it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is to acknowledge that we have the right to our rage and some reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way makes us irrational or make far claims illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we become destructive or harmful it means that we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to\nOther women to make which is to acknowledge that we have the right to outrage and some reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way makes us irrational or make far claims illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means that we happen to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see\n'em and more women need to give themselves permission to do that I've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for\nUs to change this very scary a trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about\nA we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for us to be able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room and the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have written on to the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks\nSerena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U. S. open here's a cut I'll bring it back\nAbout a we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger in the catalyst for being able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room or in the hallways around the Senate and even the books that are esteemed authors have bring onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks\nSerena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U. S. open here's a cut I'll bring it back there to refresh my memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I ... I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it was interesting because there are so many egregious examples\nScared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger a weaponized against her\nUh yes I ... I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany and Rebecca and I have been talking about\nWas interesting because there are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct responses if there was sponsors of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um\n... and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics in the moment in the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that

people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics in the moment and the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict\nUm what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so generation of role models who have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it as\nUm athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinction\nIn the moment not be accused the way that she was accused and with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have

make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political life\nWhere there were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world Brittany Cooper I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said Martina speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards but Serino was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing just because men rage and umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulate

they could pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the

one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some catch cholera on the street smile more\nUm she was told that

she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in her own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her\nAnd how menacing an aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no\nThat's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about\nHow much energy women expend modulating considering strategize\nAngel

no\nThat's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us about\nHow much energy women expend modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us who are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women
