want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in them Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that ... tweeted and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa isn't interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that [noise] [noise]\nAbsolutely I think it's right that we're not in uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post and let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post\nHardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa using interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that\nAbsolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states and rolled media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world part of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware\nWorld's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children\nAnd is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that weren't uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions right and many other things\nI Will say though I dreams I Do kind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because then we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship but we've never tried to exert strong moral ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relation\nWho is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage does that include arms sales and include potential sanctions and many other things\nI Will say though I I'd James I do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because and we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship but we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean\nIt's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is an entangled\nBut I kind of take so nice point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it well\nThis is that let me ... me amplify that point Josh represents absolutely critical\nYou know someone who's been actually a very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in my paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all of this military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalist for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's\nThe moral authority to do it\nWell this is the limit ... the lea amplify that point Josh represents absolutely critical\nYou know someone who's been actually a very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them of paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all of this military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalist for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's like a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment ... that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it said this is a bipartisan issue\nHave it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published what is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and in Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one\nBeen a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan

no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed\nHayes what do you think is he right I think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we'd never a threatened to sanction them over a they're a you over their funding of jihad as in other extremist in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country\nOr any country in the region for their actions except for Iran who has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that are done\nRegion for their actions except for Iran who has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf ... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with is that he may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been roped killers who took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S has actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of a show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nCoach or Africa not coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was uh\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's

Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana what you do is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nOr that private but illegal business among many small dealers or it depends on how it affects the global drug trade it and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift in you know I'm sure that can is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether it causes a surgeon traffic accidents where the cost of search top split\nHow it goes in terms

studying the effects of this new policy whether it causes a surgeon traffic accidents where the costs asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy\n... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use\nAnd the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd ... who was an

schedule one narcotic it's right up there with heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd Owen who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things tax them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point no but it hasn't been easy\nAnd when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed them on to NAFTA\nAnd set it snapped a to point no but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mess right now I'm so I think this could be an issue

and there's dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to be made when you tax marijuana\nA and the uses happening anyway and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see

Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to\nThat uh families women can request to have the delivery of biases area and it turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our

health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor of midwifery at the Yale School of nursing director Tony ... vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and though lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get to everybody let me ask you how are you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that Debbie World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help on us look at decreasing says areas and\nSo I'm On the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get there but let me ask you how you you worked on research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach beer compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nIt it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out the W. World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says Erin's and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on we free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was a a associated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped the integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation\nThe series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was a a associated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it is an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife\nAre attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst in the journal and in and out comes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it is an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery ... than they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nOh Tony go and you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says area in um first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather then subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor or old definitions were assumed that\nIt's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather then subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nOr old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really proved to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFrom his book you were at the Beth Israel and I said you if you were only from so blown down here in Boston and so there's this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines more or less if you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by\nSpoke here at the Beth Israel and I said you if you were only from so blown down here in Boston so does this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines more or less if you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so I one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there an delivery rates may vary by as much as ... percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr we have a tweet ... that's relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report Holly\nWill ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money\nEnthusiasm for ... birth\nOr we have a tweet of vets relevant to this some services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report Holly\nWill ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level that playing field in in any in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one\nIn in time or perceived to be in time\nWhen\nYou're younger I had no issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than us\nConducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time ... is perceived to be in time [noise]\nMhm ...\nYou're you're ... issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery then says area and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S [noise] uh the reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospitals side because of the length of stay let's go to Sharon in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications sort of chronic disease and so I'm I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become\nGreater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay in the go to Sharon

just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just leave her for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nKind of questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nI've got about a minute\n... and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me and I you know I think um I just think it's really

for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her and and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is\nI Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... and are fully ... fully discuss them and told me what about this in charge of sexism their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how baby is born I'm the person who gives birth to the baby becomes apparent uh after that
