before we bring in our next two guests Ross one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing as a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is adjust and aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways than that well I think\nThe main thing that it that we see right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year as sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn\nKind of reversed course and start becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they are in lies to crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades show\nAnd I need three jobs just to get by so I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and start becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies to crunch\nTo get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted a zillion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what his manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on also here with this is Christine car the executive director\nOur level sure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now a and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently the describes\nHow over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and as an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less\nOn a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital s labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nI think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers and we just haven't observe that\nOverall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions going a bit faster in New England and the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps\nWage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups outpacing other industries by big margins are for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page\nAs someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field or it's enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work Michelle emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage\nThese jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can see wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWas show emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car and wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the the minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily were the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you were dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers\nMuch does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nOr [noise] well I I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working and NASA traveling there that I Know and I live there that they poured over half a million or can eaters everyday into the city and out and many of those that coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people\nAnd my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we have and to the jobs that are out there\nSee the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point\nThere that I Know when I Lived there that they report it over half a million a commuters everyday into the city and out um and many of those are coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for short is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we have and to the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see the Roosevelt shortage

she wanted me to\nShow that I was happy in his arms because she needed him to be pleased\nAnd and I was being seen I was being held and seemingly adored\nI this must be love\nAnd yet I'm terrified so

E. dot com\nIt's here and now in Nineteen Ninety to ... and went into orbit on the space shuttle endeavor and became the first African American woman to go into space\nNow twenty five years later ... has her eyes on the sky once again today she is launching a new initiative called look up for one day today Jemma said wants people to upload photos of this guy and record their reactions to what they see me jealous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWell we're asking them to share what happens when they look up at the sky daytime nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside and looking up will help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other to sell just a tiny bit more connected around\nRecordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happens when they look up at the sky daytime nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking up will help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other to fill just a tiny bit more connected around this planet\nSo you know some people will look up the sky and they will feel love they'll fill whole fill fill some people may feel afraid they may feel wonder are expensive and how they express that\nIs what we want to capture and we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to take these photos and you've got to put them up\nWe're going to display them to the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at that can expand they could go to different folks around the world so I can no in\nHouston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[noise] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of\nSky period yeah nice guy right\nAnd you got to put them up we're going to display them to the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at that can expand they could go to different folks around the world so I can no in Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\nSo I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of Marjah sky period yeah nice guy right in a nice guy well but but in the sky period and and in the last couple of months we've been able to see for planets uh every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in cities disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\n... I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet let's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are\nBut what I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we are looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were seeing what people are we're even seeing our impact\nOf on this planet and so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars route but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth where there was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this then shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere it's this planet that warms us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet and we have to figure\nAnd I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this censure marine layer of light that ... is our atmosphere it's this planet that warms us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and then while we're connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise] well\nWant people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nSo much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster we really care about each other but that carried only happens\nWhen we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up as a sky something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth sits\n... on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have [noise] no I actually\nHave a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it a ... ... is a sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between this guy\nYou know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do\nWhat this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way we were calling the ads that we had that completely free we're calling it a sky feet at right at the sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between the sky\nYou know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of uh this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions why we have you because you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth in the next hundred years [noise]\nLet's I when I hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of of a governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it by here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on\nMaking sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of of governance in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send\nRight right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really changed fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live\n... is it is really changed fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship and the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out as a crew how to live together that means that we do foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference [noise]\nDirt now are a number a small number but a number of African American women who've gone into space\nBut you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time\nPlanet in our behavior makes a difference\nThere are now are a number a small number but a number of African American women who've gone into space\nBut you'll

to go up in space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\nBecause I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up but being that\nBeing the the first one was called her in the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being the the rocket scientist to suit technicians you know are being a crew members to involve them in
