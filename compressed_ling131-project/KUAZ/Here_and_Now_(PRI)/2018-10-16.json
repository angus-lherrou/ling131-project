that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with it we\nStill rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag\nViolating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with

to stop the majority of that at a time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if

work\nOur our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things

happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how's that pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves for instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we will remove your account even if you're not otherwise pilot in our content policies we also have policies against\nTerror organizations and our members hate organizations\nUm and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ... and on that page you

... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that is going to come through to our review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking

on you know research this was an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in this but um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this in the schools\nSpecial illness but um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them

cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues as supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and

the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students who is one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on\nA broader

students are black\nThen they have different schooling experience isn't that affects a minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's it's much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student isn't that a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both of those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nThis is an unheard of in twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is uh\nThe teacher and the student isn't that a place for each to

about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice but it's what we've done for nearly a hundred years\nJust feels like segregation literally a segregated hung on that you had you know what do you read about the wisdom that\nWe do and I I'd say two things about that one if you're you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group

for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with ... both white teachers and teachers of color\nHaving a parallel experience to the other home room and the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nYou know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school [noise] so what happens now you've dropped the homeroom experiment how do you move forward\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what ... what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the components of students identity that we think about when we're putting

E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan uh where you have ended this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so a lot of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan they'll thanks so much it's been a pleasure tomorrow\nWas Erwin high school there in Manhattan [noise] uh where you had to end is this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by then you know um other kids feel super supported so a lot of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan filled thanks so much it's been a pleasure\nTomorrow we'll speak with an African American educator who says there are times to group kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the finalists in the annual comedy wildlife photography award photographer Tom sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat isn't very good question I Choose the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I'm going to think about what I just that's how I view my average ...\nLet's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can will also have last year's winters up because those were hilarious but this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth\n[noise] what is a very good question I Choose personally the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I didn't have to think about why I just that's how I Do my original technique\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe this must be camel also have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth is wide open I think the saying job [laughter] it's called caught in the active uh from photographer Mary ... a gallon I mean that's a laugh out loud\nIs allowed and definitely one of my favorites I think it's virtually impossible just to see the animal and then not think of ... that I'm thinking something goes through your mind very quickly I have this vision of showing off his United her showing how do you go to Brandon [laughter]\nIt's just a few different ... you said UC schools things do you know people's different things which is why I Love this problem petition because that street and humid is on different levels where everyone\nSee well yeah I got gel nails this time we [laughter] then we have that to a komodo dragons this is a photo\nVision of showing off his new name her showing how unite was up to ...
