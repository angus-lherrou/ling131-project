with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiated for us honorary halfway salary health insurance\nAll that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent a higher level Caesar accountability that will ultimately lead to higher salaries\nMore competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers achieved tenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teacher\nSalary health insurance all that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent the higher level Caesar accountability that would ultimately lead to higher salaries\nMore competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers achieved tenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teaching market and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with is Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that first off I've not always been happy with everything that my union has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe union is not just your union leaders any movements are driven by members and lenders need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about\nFirst off I've not always been happy with everything that my union has done\nBut one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers the union is not just your union leaders union movements are driven by members and members need to demand and you know what they want to see the union do\nAlso I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices um it's actually not\nThat difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that you can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe them\nYou have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or\nYou know and part of the reason that's so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you know counties could save money by not keeping those teachers around\nWhich I'm sure I Know that your goal was to get into West Virginia house of delegates and try to work with your dog it's about um\nSo we're going to let you go or you know and part of the reason that so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go see her I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates and trying to work with the other dog it's about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of your state\nOr really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike\nTo make things happen in West Virginia\n[noise] I think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful\nWe could not have done what we did with out is supportive our communities and I think that our community is realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just about pay or just about healthcare it's not about that not just about that it's about improving\nConditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general um I have seen with my own eyes\nIs why the strike was so successful\nWe could not have done what we did with out is supportive our communities and I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just about pay or just about healthcare it's not about that not just about that it's about improving\nConditions for students for teachers for families

alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union correct me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want\nBut a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences that you're talking about\nI Know someone that we

wages\nRight well um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now the ceiling it depends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's good can't cut a context just for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that ... their mileage make very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the Janice case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier\nAnd sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes

to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions\nAnything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired and going back to that contract is a a floor and not feel

give to write a Sims or wills to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks in right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you don't have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know that what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument so John\nUse their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to reduce their wells to donate their cars to be you

with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was or Scott there which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center\nActually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide case sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states\nIf we we if we had done

first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't\nIt yeah it was a part of the condition of the access we always the kid the access with the government's consented to Danny Way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the bells about lots of happened to the gym three is they held by Boko Haram why am partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may\nIt was a part of the condition of the access we always be secure the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the girls about what happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram wire partly a\nI mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them and not government safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite rule they um we're still processing what would happen to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us we're not counsellors to push them into reliving and telling us what had happened\nThat we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to but equally anytime we wherever alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the girls time in captivity\nWasn't for us when all counsellors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBut he could eat anytime we wherever alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see that goes time in captivity because they were held for three years before ... down and they were released\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like well they they um low they was free to speak to is they did give us that diaries discreetly ... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called the and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and in the film what we do is\nThe uh the girls that you book goes who were taken would actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by by her around who are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is\n[noise] with false to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they call the in the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and then the film what we do is the uh the bills that you book goes who were taken would actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through that testimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the Gulf that we interviewed who and all and the sound is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... or you become a slave and if you're a slave then\nIt's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\n[noise] yeah so what we were told by a a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier fool you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the Gulf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it's say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of\nWhen we first met had like she she did tell us I don't love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were

will\nSay well ... has been kidnapping children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill an arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally yeah\nKale and arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been cannot but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of ... living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these they call them id Pete camps or intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run too because Boko Haram you know they don't just could not they then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous but also safety by numbers and that's where the food aid is going to see how if you want food and he wants to live that's why you have to run\nTheir ... but then a lot of the I Love it\nAnd that's why they have to run too because Boko Haram you know they don't just could not they then button and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous but who says safety by numbers on that whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to run\nInto their ... but then a lot of uh uh loves internally displaced people end up living within the community say\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they've also been incredibly welcoming to the numbers the space people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nI mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled the Nigerian military and that constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the sex\nCaptivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled ... Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night that happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stop them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into ... said the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nAbout the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including a some who managed to escape let's listen to one\n[noise] and say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line woods I ... you just don't know whether it's coming from and why and when I said there's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including a some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your film\nI'm not ... because everything has changed my life [noise] now that the nation ... he's alright ...

information is available at legal zoom dot com slash now\nThis is here and now TV viewers to watch the Fox network last night some more than The Simpsons Bob's Burgers and the family guy\nThey also got a peek at the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy ...\nMore on Fox has only ... what do we have fought for skin they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can recap you say where you live for Sunday Sunday edition sponsored by Google makes all three\nHere now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what's going on with ranking behind this\nThat's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the

John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAll right let's take this first change Fox is calling it the Ninety nine second sixty seconds ... be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpot what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you'd as they've got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs that also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain right right so Brenda ...\nAs pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means that traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second you to have got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd that also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new content is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand that content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy or brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nOf financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet uh they have they they believe that having fewer\nPrime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSort of financial model is to charge more for the jazz ... so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain it's All right\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much thank you so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThere are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car\nMedia analyst thanks very much I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are\nDynamic for example here in the United states we have almost two hundred fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day and so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that all cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nSo you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nOn lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to test led to a Porsche\nAre around you and then what\nYeah so you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and Dr ... and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attest led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... ah which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access the more this market grows for all players\nWell some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased\nA massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which is car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more this market gross for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies yeah sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger\nWhen they could just jumping to lift\nYeah so I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace\nSo you believe people really do want to live without a car\nCustomers is that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing\nThey need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true yeah\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for that money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like Toyota and over so it was continue investing those partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of rubber and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nA great question and it's something that we've since day one than sort of very aware of in fact that I taught him was cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're ...\nAnd we've been very fortunate to partners some some great companies like an over so it was continue investing those partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of rubber and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact that I taught him was cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to them\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than\nAs autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done through a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles

stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then it would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were for fifty years out and autonomy is sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where\nYou know the cars we know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of cities in
