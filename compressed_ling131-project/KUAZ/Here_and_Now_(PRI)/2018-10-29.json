A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't recover so when you look at\nWorkplace sexual harassment laws um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex but title seven only\nCovers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees that if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about\nWhich states are expanding protections and who they're covering yeah\nDefinitely so we've seen at least twenty\nIf you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to ... workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation and twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states are have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending forced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York Tennessee California as you mentioned Vermont in Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements\nUm so how many hours must uh employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that path\nIn um California is just one example of that\nTipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be\nTennessee California and he mentioned Vermont and Washington and other states are also looking addict standing training requirements um so how many hours must uh employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that\nIn California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from an ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it it can change your reputation I really wish I could ever protect myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nProfessor tipping how common is this for freelancers and need a situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nIn a post that on my social media ... it can change your reputation I really wish I could ever protect myself in both situations are just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFor us we're tipping how common is this for freelancers in the in a situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections ah like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nSpeaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of

complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nIs true we have seen his share and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of our class harassment which is exciting that they've been in creative and will to they're thinking about how do we really solve that problem and one of the things that lawmakers have them\nAppreciate it although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expending sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that there's been new creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there's no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention to workplace harassment\nIs some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nI I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other\nWe are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior so one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain types of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment well when you think\nAbout me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system so part of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law for employers to get out of

that um we just heard about that were passed last last a session\nAs well as if you love the unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their

with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nI'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note to quite a few of you

number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure in confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder says and if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information

where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose in contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just call them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily ban nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as they relate to this specific late to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for\nThese contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily ban nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as they relate to this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically before we move on to too much for there can you just define that ... what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's a type that you mentioned that people sign at the start of their employment and says keep our information confidential and there was another type of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit

they help each other he'll now\nRemember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I\nI thought what seems odd but it seems odd to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen well when the when the shots started an injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say\nTogether they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am such meat yeah cats you can't say for sure that that would happen well\nWhen the when the shots started the injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating ... and then he did\nMore afterwards or as I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought on to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say did something happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog because you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something he's going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts\nHave fought on to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with the dogs on these going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody else where to party argue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle them but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know we do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books in certain words and that's why I quote people like flattery O'Connor\nAs a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know we do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic Lee they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYeah since they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIt true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs yes\nDuring the Nineteen eighties in California there\nWere many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening buddies lot judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not gonna give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nSeemed to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou will to talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not gonna give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nBoy could be boats or maybe it's a friend is the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my my married her really does Mitt this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person to our cat person for example she says I'm\nA cat person give me a pet\nLove cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble with this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that into a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Ellis furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her\nRemind me of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn\nOn her head as they do you have\nHer only solace is that she is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone oh\nYes that's that's very moving well and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it I just have to ask\nYou it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not\nAround the piece

dog and then suddenly it was all about a dog in you know with such a punch", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Tucson", "day": "29"}
