population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nIs a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date and if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then it does\nQuite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that

everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state\nSo this happens every ten years and then every ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways\nUh some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power ... other states other

are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty\nOr the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and in the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate\nOr in crazy ways in ways that where the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own hiccups with political junkie\nWeeks

particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if

aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we there's also a Detroit has pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still

theme that you present is the political is the personal give us\nExamples of how among these five women are the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nSo um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen\nFor planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handouts stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses\nBut before they even carried out their plan the police and and all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around ever rats\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five\nThey were jailed in twenty Fifteen for planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handouts stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses\nBut before they even carried out their plan the police and in all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping round of arrests\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their release being detained for what is it ... well I'm ... well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because I'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charge them with and and in the end it was something\nAkin to disturbing the social order\nUm but the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was\nTo handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment okay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to adjust\nAnd it was something akin to disturbing the social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film is fine\nUm well I mean among the feminist five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse and their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the mites herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement has personally been um victims\nFor example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement\nHas personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence\nAnd that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back\nOne of the of some of his five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree\nYou know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nWell I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume that double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThis outage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nWell I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume the double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really um the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda the rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms um but\nJust in the world in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist hero because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThat dissatisfaction with\nWith this huge gender gap that women\nYou know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed\nHas grown is because of the dissatisfaction with\nWith this huge gender gap that women\nYou know have to put themselves behind men and and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um but if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing\nA particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do because these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you ...\nSo the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long\nThen their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media that women in college shouldn't wait\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long\nThen their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media that women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um so the the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now\nOfficially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\nIn every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went on line and we're sharing their stories and other areas I work with all the censorship going on in China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship would just become incredibly sophisticated\nAnd so what is unfolding right now

hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court has some ugly consequences Sarah Verizon has a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school as you did I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I play basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller [laughter] so [laughter] you should um [noise]\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help he is of mixed heritage\nHigh school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly white an affluent um private school as you did I I did which I was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help he is of mixed heritage his dad his Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um vision is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues ... right right and he I mean you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was the ... face right All right yeah sort of shocked on yeah and a half century anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who his son to his mother and other parents are are very upset and um\nSchool someone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues ... right right and heat you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was in ... right All right yeah so shocked on yeah and uh has sent it anonymously to the student body so the schools trying to figure out who was sent to his mother and other parents are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him an allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be\nUm the poster boy for international politics right [laughter]\nAnd people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kind of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to and no kids should really have to do you have to deal with it I sort of did this thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of\nRight [laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kind of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do you have to deal with it I sort of did this thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim grow up pretty secular but technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating\nA Japanese person to a Korean person where so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of it before you called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well ... what's the difference\nThat opinion piece saying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating\nA Japanese person to a Korean person where it's so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of\nIt before you called us polite racism and this is something to be John faces as well ... what's the difference between polite and impolite where he says I think most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism\nBut there's a difference between\nPainting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone so how does speech on in the book realize that to understand I think he's he's had to deal with sort of\nIt's in for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect 'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal\nA little barbed or and made to sort of other someone so how does speech on in the book realize that to understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of it's in for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part it's pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know set for yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to\nTo have him have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what he what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist for me\nAnd then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because they do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia like the character to just have an adventure or you know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters\nGet to do twenty of just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't white lady does your person you don't want to be the ... well no but\nFor all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved but I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it may be after the book finishes but for that\nThe person you don't want to be the ... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved but I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it may be after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time\n[noise] what do you what's the pay for you is it just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people less\nIf you were you know I mean this is a young adult books\nThe book doesn't represent them fully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people less\nIf you were in I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and one of the conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice and prejudice times\nHow can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out Sarah ... thank you thank you so much appreciate it Sarah fires on the\nBook is called here to stay to read an
