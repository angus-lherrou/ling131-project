with all due respect I don't get or if you don't get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared ... is a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal to weigh in on what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it

there and\nUm that's administration I also just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family Michael at the same and um my two little ones I adore them and to team us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time\nAnd energy into it um but they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America proud and so with that\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good slate and on for the next ... to come in but now I don't have anything he sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand your blood or church shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in and do you years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be\nAnd we dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting there was a lot\nAnd then to come in and do the years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense\nTime and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to the south let's enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so\nThank you that's been out\nAnd I will say\nThis I'm for all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nElection but his Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with ... brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get to an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nOh absolutely absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we had seen just like we've seen increased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends at work too and it feels dicey or at work\nFor Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nOh absolutely absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune\nFrom the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen increased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential Z and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\nYeah 'cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up if that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just need to be the one person I Do to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there and the minute that we start\nIt's one step away from getting into a cultural today where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just needs to be the one person I Need to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being urban and compassionate and knew that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love\nThat is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mass shot had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions and so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and rumble and ...\nYou're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I've never seen anything meaningful or significant come from mouth shut had down in my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to\nListen talk here each other and rumble and we use the term rumble 'cause it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experiences all of who you are to address the problems\nReading your book and be sold the research that fueled the book a lot of what's\nIn armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high and we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experiences all of who you are to address the problems\nFor reading your book and based on the research that fueled the book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a star yeah scars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really\nIt was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive ... yeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students at Wharton Kellogg Rice University and then\nIt just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case so\nWe asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred fifty sea level global leaders three years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were MBA and NBA students at Wharton Kellogg\nRice University and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when\nIt was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often\nAnd they're like what I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long I was like so that blew my hypothesis of fear\nBeing the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is armor\nIt's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger that having to be the newer and get everything right instead of being the learner um so really\nI'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long and I was like so that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is armor\nIt's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger the having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner um so really\nYou know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to places not only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create work cultures were armor is not rewarded or needed [noise] we\nAre some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces

of owner ability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nThose are those are everyday traumas and it is real that ... that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of Anita Hill criticisms that happen after the Ford testimony\nAnd it is real that that that that you know the armor that you need to

the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the for testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during away now are more data all got your dad\nWho was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core\nValues and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind\nOf mission statement or vision or clarification or posters everywhere saying this is who we are supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which was printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies were their value statement was like Fifteen bullet\nPoints Laura I'm like well what what was it was even starts\nYou know she mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company\nThat doesn't have some kind of mission statement or vision for clarification or posters everywhere saying this is who we are supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed\nI work at some companies wind been to some companies where their values statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well what what will it will start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to yeah just to end the long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list that I really struggled barrel down to my to why only two\nWell here's the thing if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat pastor\nI mean it really is just really a poster so like a movie point in my head that little will tell you [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so\nWas so you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken\nBe held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster I mean it really it was just really a poster [noise] so ... reporting on my head but little do yeah [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so what\nWas so you know operation lies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data the men and women who had the capacity\nTo be the most courageous could identify their values\nThey had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nOh truism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independents self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list yes\nTo be the most courageous could identify their values\nThey had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independents self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my ... my two core values for me are facing courage and I know that the core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational ... and into behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assessed shoot every quarter\nOn the values that you were to do it\nWe have a companion workbook

every\nQuarter was on the values that you were to do with\nLike for example one of our values is take good care taking care of each other ourselves in the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you don't and so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble if on her ability living into your values
