will take it they will take it I wondered why you set it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself I hear you I told you and try to make you laugh\nWhy didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't\nAnd they instead of their though if I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said we wouldn't I told you\nThat fool got matter because you were speaking correct English\nYou looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key\nBut in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though I Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back\nThat cop gave me the bubble goods you laughed and laughed and laughed\nCan correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key\nBut in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English save you though I Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back\nThat cop game in a bubble goods\nYou laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't while I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seem like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky and the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison\nIf they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of fly\nOther eggs are crew heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threatening us with guns in prison if they didn't

where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's a crust of a lot of uh the relationship to talk about in his book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school in eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and when my best best friends um to get a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way he did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put a knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes and often um\nA few my best friends from a previous school were there and when my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way he did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put a knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers and in that situation I learned that sometimes and often a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so uh my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEating a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out and that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom had the you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to asking this section and also in the entire book what\nNo you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out an elaborate without checking it out and that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom ahead you know you can duck them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to the home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and wind power doing un that's the question I'm trying to asking a section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you are trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her yeah one one way I think\nA lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were right some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about why people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about what's like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different that relationship but I Would never talk to her\nTo be a a a lot more active in trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nUm but and we could talk about

she saw me in relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself when I was mistreating people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside of the house\nThe particular kinds of violence as they were happening in my house were completely silent we never knew how to talk about it

Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nAnd Bradley junior welcome to hear now that you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania\nThis is a county ... county in northeast Pennsylvania county seat is Wilkes Barre uh it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time President Obama wanted\nIt's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through uh the vote in the three critical swing states

another\nAnd ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but it's settled on twelve a who stories\nI decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that at least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened and\nYou talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that

Lewes earned county\nBut I think people base most of their vote for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level a how likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settled on a generally like Trump on most issues\nBut really liked his style they just like today is uh is moxie his feisty in is how we get up every morning and I'm ... has a tweet storm and a six to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to

heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable ... [noise] one\nOf the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying\nWas not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in ... county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is it's not actually going to build the wall but he's going to he's going to beef up the wall\nThe interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump ... saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nOr what he said we would get into lively discussions about this I said well that's the process job candidate says something and\nYou know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is at

the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty eight\nEvangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing that he's been married three times they don't care for them the I think the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty Eighteen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is ... you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I read the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and is trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county and\nI'm neither Trump for the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan he said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years going up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care\nAbout what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to\nDo they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over or anything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are

schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to group the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students said it smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former pets\nUh that felt supportive of their academic experience but the parents of some of the minority students said it smelled of segregation and they worried that he gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school ended the policy\nOur question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\n... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts\n[noise] um I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book in the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise] it seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look\nTime together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book and the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise]\nIt seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening [noise] one of the things that's happening is that changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty\nThey start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest that a black boys in school in particular are more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls\nAre experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure will\nIn school in particular are more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure well\nIf I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like that\nBut that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school and if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThan you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation would end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about\nThe kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and\nHigher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is in a sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation with in racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about\nThe kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper tracks you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book but\nTo read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us to the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counts\nBook but to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores are still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support\nWithout making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this\nUs to the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counsel for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four\nThe notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city\nOut to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools\nAre black or Latino and often there's this sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs\nLook at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not ... but you write another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school a majority\nOr Latino and often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not ... but you had another anecdote about\nA young girl who was in a school a majority white and a teacher saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to see how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in at school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one\nThe racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in at school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his whole room\nIt sounds like that there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically\nAnd also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more support it they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been writing on a bus from Boston for an hour\nAnd they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically and also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study um they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era\nAnd some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting and so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about a debrief it's soda so to speak\nIn that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful but anyway the title of your book again\nSomething that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting and so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible I'm\nWas upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about it the brief it's so to so to speak in that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asked why the white kids in the cafeteria their bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students who are more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nIt's we're more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Tucson", "day": "17"}
