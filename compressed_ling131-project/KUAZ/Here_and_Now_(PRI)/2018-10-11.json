the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nYeah I I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh and I was expected him from the crowd of people over there I mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a show\nA little bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about when and putting the season together is this weird moment

surreal to be a show runner unimpressed to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a ... a little bit it's it's strange and\nKnow one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the ah tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nAnd it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just\nYou know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh directors brings so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd that yes I Am doing all these interviews now and talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all\nAnd we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by Lisa handle all the uh directors brings so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd that yes I Am doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who presents that as our TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slap stick the ponds and the Pratt falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nHim it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season and what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this\nSo has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes for him it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's a talking octopus\nOr you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this is quite serious about the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is retelling stories about real grounded characters and a crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your former [laughter]\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah where do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nIs is we're telling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but

[laughter]\n[noise] um oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nNo I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American audience well I I think\nKnow obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season of Bo jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson ... um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the bubble um or the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first it's going to feel like a typical\nI show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons and um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're going to watch it and the first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really\nTake things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak and he said they are credible princess Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat uh Internet a lot of others to even have that Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah um\nDon't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously um but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah we'll our net as Beau jak any today are credible artist Carolyn sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and and then a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some\nYeah I'm ... and it's one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd I was cast her whale as a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Linda ... I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role and really and we call them like yeah sounds like fun\nUm and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had to do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some we'll noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of as a very serious man uh goofing around going\n\nYou know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nBack season after season and you know what am I a first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had to do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some we'll noises\nAnd you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of as a very serious man uh goofing around going [noise]\nYou know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison ... who was phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American this in the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it well\nWe cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we've been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of this\nCan this in the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nUm we cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we've been working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a a contractual issue so she couldn't be a lead on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about you know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our house was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist a man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were passing these characters one at a time uh and I realized that oh\nCast and and thinking about you know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our castles whites and our main cast and a lot of\nThe recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as\nA racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting his characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is like I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles\nAnd I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character\nAnd you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it's not like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know ...\nNot a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do

passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this won't become the thing that I end up talking about in every interview ... and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there was also talking ... you know anti eaters and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how was an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans
