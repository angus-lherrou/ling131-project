faced and he was furious on behalf of Brett Kavanaugh and presumably\nBefore the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor that Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cabin on he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody saw it I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years\nYou've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party you're the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking in as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen\nThe Republican Party you're the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking in his party [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party of the future meaning Republicans had your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it any more stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hulk vacation in the Trump here it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it tells me that the\nDivide is deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election there was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last to Brock Obama\nAnd in the Trump here it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it tells me that the divide is deepening and you know it did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last a Brock Obama including what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just the one the general election to lead to a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party is like the primary is like you didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's what I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the republic\nThat's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party is like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted more than ... more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what's he think yeah I mean look there's there there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jump out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nThinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular

he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also this theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him\nMaybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump in twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road and then seeing down from ...\nThat have part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing Donald Trump win the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard\nAnd because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates\nWe can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the

because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me\nThat I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting yeah at the main political science they did the voters who go and they\nWere Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket\nHas been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and then that that is just the rise of

him ... before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on night time talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those

speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point versus a Ross Perot [laughter] begging place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton in so they were his

gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with the traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers in the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hard at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show

and uh back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it would be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that or an interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I wanted to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSo like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said how things transpired and why they happen the way they did and the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know

it might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you're talking about at the beginning you grew up in\nBaton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food or you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called a liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you were able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know\nUm basically what I just said that\nI don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with

going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a a feeling for where I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never sign a nondisclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand

didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy\nWith you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out but then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and\nI just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell the my side of the stories that people would understand where I was coming from and at the same time all these other women were coming forward and\nI just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and

time all these other women were coming forward and\nI just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it what do you want to happen to Michael Cohen [noise]\nUm I think we're all about to find out on what is the December twelve\nHe was the kind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it\nYou know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he had messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean and I'm at the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call the he admitted that I was telling the truth\nWas a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being in the adult ...\nDead and then when he realized he'd messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves

I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being in the adult entertainment business you know but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this nondisclosure now my fear lies mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they're awesome\nBut what does that what is that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nI happened to me because there are people who knew about this non disclosure now my fear lives mostly with just sort of crazy fans not directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they're awesome [laughter]\nBut what is that what does that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel on how would you be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted I've gotten used to it and we become friends and it's just the way that it is\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they harbor this inner self esteem problem that they tried to mask\nBy over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceived him at the beginning\nTwo thousand six and you say your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which

that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceive to him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much ice does stand by that feeling you know\nAsk anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their biggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have companies and people in a high power um\nAnd then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very\nPrivileged unspoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and\nStill holds true today how would you describe it today\nI don't know I Would have
