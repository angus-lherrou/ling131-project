Springs Texas earlier this year there was of course the church shooting in Charleston South Carolina a few years of a few years ago\nWhat is it about places of worship that make them such

where would you go you go to a synagogue ... going to be all Jews there if you want to target Muslims you can go to a mosque if you want to target black people you can go to it a predominantly black

church of the resurrection in league with Kansas or tell us about your ...\nIs a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City is a downtown Kansas City Missouri was friends with her in a couple and the Kansas on\nAnd it's a very diverse congregation it's a highly educated largely a highly educated we have um we did a poll not long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nBut Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independents are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independent so we ever were pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world\nYou know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nThe Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independence are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independent so we ever were pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I constantly have not constantly but I regularly get emails from folk saying well you know you're being too political and wish you wouldn't talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates but what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms your politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper\nSense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely and I pray that when you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in a value system how much do you as a as a pastor is diminished\nHurt we're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper\nSense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely and I pray that when you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system to value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor is a minister lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know typing earlier I just do a sermon on actually the story of the garden to be anything but politics yeah\nSo here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this than the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday based on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning than than again probably something morning and so what I said it's a that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have\nWho are upset by it they feel like I'm doing all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this in the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday based on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning than than again probably something morning and so what upset is and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance\nAnd yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these teams the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that a I mean I I think people are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to a church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYear round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting and even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at what\nOf what they're already getting every day so what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where when are the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting\nAnd even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how you know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical lucky electron ethics\nWe're gonna look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I tried to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth and this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation then I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but this is I see this issue right now [noise] gun guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools\nI'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth and this complex moral issue that this one site has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation then I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but this is obviously this issue right now [noise]\nGun guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and\nAnd it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left in the right on some of these basic things now that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality and the actual policy yeah uh it does actually so so here we're talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in the school so the shootings in schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities is presenting issue and so and obviously\nRead on both the left and the right on some of these basic things now that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality and the actual policy yeah um it does actually so so here we are talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond to you\nKnow the issues of shootings in school so the shootings in schools as the presenting or just violence in our communities is presenting issue and so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so you've got plenty plenty of places where we talk about\nHow do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got Paul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise]\nSo so there's a part of that that's going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another part that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense and in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting\nAre there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense and in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I loved dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting in the school on the other side you know you've got these aren't people who want to take all your guns away\nThese are people who want us to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and you can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at your church do they want a place to deal with the social issues that they want a refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture or do they want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you\nThe answer is yes [laughter] a lot of it if I if I get emails across the spectrum I have people who are like you know I\nIt opens the door to finding answers what does your congregation want from its religious experience at your church do they want a place to deal with the social issues\nThat they want to refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture but did he want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes all of a\nOf it if I get emails across the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talk about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nAnd uh but I've got other folks are like so immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated from the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how it's going to resolve because I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I have people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that was Father's Day we can talk about it but um so I it's all over the map on that are there but here\nThroughout the week I'm

nation's most politically divided denominations congregants and pastors are both split almost fifty fifty between Democrats and Republicans\nThat rising partisanship is particularly challenging for pastors like Hamilton and that's where we pick up a conversation how the\nWe talked about with pastor Adam Hamilton he founded the church of the resurrection which is America's largest Methodist congregation\nNow a recent study found that and Methodists or one of the nation's most politically divided denominations congregants and pastors are both split almost fifty fifty between Democrats and Republicans\nThat rising partisanship is particularly challenging for pastors like Hamilton and that's where we pick up the conversation how\nDo you help your congregation see themselves as children of God first I think it's very easy today to just see people as jets and sharks\nThis kind of political do ... which to me is both boring and the humanizing right and it just negates the three dimension Audi of of humanity\nI Wonder how you as a faith leader especially with a gigantic congregation them\nHelp keep people seeing\nOne another in an equivalent way and and see through and around and pass the politics yeah so that is something that we talk about regularly and I tried to model for them the modeling of treating people with dignity and respect and hearing their voices and not that they're all equal voices but just being able to treat people I mean the so\nHow you as a faith leader especially with a gigantic congregation\nHelp keep people seeing\nOne another in an equivalent way and and see through and around and pass the politics yeah so that is something that we talked about regularly and I try to model for them\nThe modeling of treating people with dignity and respect and hearing their voices and not that they're all equal voices but just being able to treat people I mean the so in the during to set to have sixteen I had our our country should memorize to versus\nA do unto others as you have them do unto you I Hope you'll have this memorized already but if you don't we're going to memorize that and I want you to think about that every time you have a conversation about politics\nWhat does it mean to do unto others as you have them do unto you and then there was a a I think I actually have three I think the second one was love your neighbors you'll have yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the aisle or somebody's vote you know love Trump or somebody who hates Trump\nHow are you going to love them because you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President but got you're deeply about what do you love your fellow human beings and John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say you love God you can't see\nAnd uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says ...\nSelf so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the our somebody's vote loves Trump or somebody who hates Trump how are you going to love them because you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President gutters deeply about what do you love your fellow human beings and\nJohn says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say you love God you can't see and uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building others up as there is need that your words might give grace to those who here\nAnd so it's not a not only applies to your words out of your mouth but the ones you type in social media\nHow are you\nAllow your words to give grace to others as opposed to the humanizing them or you know so if you can\nFollow him on passage ... author some people who we just need to lead have it feels\nSo good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now and I feel like it's just it's too satisfying\nTo take the moral high ground men say what you know those people whoever those people are right need the here and I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue it just feels\nHave it feels so good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now and I feel like it's just it's too satisfying\nTo take the moral high ground men say what you know those people whoever those people are that are needed to hear\nAnd I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue it just feels to satisfy the finally let her out\nI think that's exactly right I think that's what we feel that we have to guard against I think it it naturally no there's not this isn't saying don't share what you think about sharing what you think in a way that's reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but it could be wrong about this and that treats the other as a human being is really important and most of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and\nWhat if I'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible\nYeah yeah yeah well that goes back to our question about just second ago about the nuances the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out I can pull it averse and I can sing you with a thousand different versus that aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one versus out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments is you cannot have accomplished\nIt feels really good and I'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible yeah yeah yeah well that goes back to our question about just second ago about the new law says the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out I can pull it averse and I can sing you with a thousand different versus\nThat aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one versus out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments is you cannot have a complex argument\nIn two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter I mean thankfully they doubled them a space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know a nifty responses on Facebook to somebody's post\nAnd you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I I challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching\nAnd prophetic preaching has to do with saying the hard things you know and addressing justice and and righteousness all these things\nBut but when it comes to prophetic preaching ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people are influenced them\nIt irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's going to\nHurt their feelings or irritate them or make the mad but if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how to\nThe country we talked about prophetic preaching and prophetic preaching has to do with saying the hard things you know and addressing justice and and righteousness all these things but but when it comes to prophetic preaching ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people are influenced them\nIt irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's going to\nHurt their feelings or irritate them or make the mad\nBut if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how do I do that so if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your family and friends who might have different views you got to say how could I Do that in a way that my mom who feels totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before\nAnd that's why you know when it comes to preaching unconsciously issues I typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this see it this way here's what level people on the side it this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I find myself more compelled by this but if you're on the other side no how much I Love you I mean\nI've had people come and go I came in and I knew were preaching this and I was gonna hate your sermon 'cause I kinda had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to hate oh yeah yeah but then the way you approached my side open my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say that's gotta be hard\nSee this see this well here's what buffalo people in this I'd see it this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I find myself more compelled by this but if you're on the other side no how much I Love you and you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this and I was gonna hate your sermon 'cause I kind of had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to hate oh yeah yeah but then the way you approached my side\nOpen my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say\nThat's gotta be hard for you though as a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm you know but just personally in your own and I I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual walk\nI Wonder how you are dealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation who knows the obligation on a pastor and who's trying I'm sure trying not to hurt anybody and doesn't like being told\nI was ready to start arming Iraq believe it or the\nBefore I let you go pastor Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time\nI actually feel like that's a a that's a part of the calling and how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel\nTrying I'm sure trying not to hurt anybody and doesn't like being told\nI was ready to start arming Iraq believe it or the\nBefore I let you go pastor Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time\nI actually feel like that's a a that's a part of the calling and how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided and that I'm trying to help them hear each other and find a I I told them in our polarized country you know I feel like the church has a role to play in bringing healing to a polarized nation\nAnd we're we're a place that's our defining value was love\nSo if we can't figure out how to do this together in our congregation what hope is there for the world\nSo I Want you to be in a small group or a Bible study or a sunny school class of people who disagree with you and I want you to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters and how do you come out with a stronger view a better view better informed because you've listened to both sides\nI mean seldom are issues that were really divided about as a country completely black and white if they were we wouldn't be divided everybody degree but instead there is some truth on both sides there and so so anyway I when I was younger and so I'm fifty turned fifty four next month\nIt'd be in a small group or a Bible study or Sunday school class of people who disagree with you in a way to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters and how do you come out with a stronger view a better view better informed because you've listened to both sides I mean seldom are issues that were really divided about as a country\nOf those

well basically because fear you know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify\nBudget can you can look at the consequences of it and the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks\nIn the book and certainly I might add discussing whether the lowest the long term outlook is all about\nHow we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nThe reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that\nIn title ... which are mandated by law a gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings in the economy dollar for dollar and so long\nAnd and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that\nIn title ... which are mandated by law\nA gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar and so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners but what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of the Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds\nAnd balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent indefinitely into the future to do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFirst of all do I think it's going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major\nNow the official actuaries of their Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent and definitely into the future to do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFirst of all do I think it's going to happen\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it a good cause the debt overall the total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation\nWhere you say inflation is a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about uh for example interest rates and fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise for no other reason that they're below the ...\nThey remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about it for example interest rates and fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we kept rates low cost you own employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace and the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't feel that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation\nAs you point employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace and the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't feel that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learnt strangely for the first time in two thousand and it is there a two conditions as quiet for a crisis\nOne is there a toxic asset like a\nSecured ties to mortgages\nBut the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and one day off\nCause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learned strangely for the first time in two thousand mood is there a two

community\nAnd probably also taken the lead probe community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was

be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grown ups were\nListening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses and everyone um have surrounded this community with caring\nSense of what they see and one of the

help children recognize and identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers yes\n[noise] as part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence locals and\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout

young child can take\nWith out of being overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good nest attractive [laughter]\nRight now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of us to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but he also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive\nAnd I think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us\nFred Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children it and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative ways\nTo were British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nI think he would be horrified

horrified by what happened and and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um\nAnd you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and neighbor in the greatest
