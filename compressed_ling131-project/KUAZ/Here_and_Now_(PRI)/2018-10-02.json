U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military and give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other sciences have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield what an asymmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you were in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call it an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you\nSo so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield what an asymmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you were in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call it an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a mastermind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of its scientist engineer and an artist\nBut moving forward you think of the physicist as the person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know that can is you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist might

mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days are strong numbers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any

better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of

Smith who a Ford says was there a it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which he and his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which\nAh that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen\nFirst gathering specifically includes\nMark judge to whom I just referred a guy named PJ ... Smith who a Ford says was there a it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which ah his friends got together for beers on weekdays there are all these ways in which\nA that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country have you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that our first of flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when a your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing and as your book page back to you at the same meaning it was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence such a sixteen year book page\nOn 'em game it's all about that's not what this means\nWell it's sort of unclear one booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth per thrift\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing and as your book page back to you at the same meaning it was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence such a sixteen year book page on 'em game\nIt's all about that's not what this means\nWell it's sort of unclear one booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious as a reference to drinking\nThat was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily you know he he said that the beach week Ralph club which is pretty obviously right a reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking\nThe fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse the anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse\n... you know he he said that the between routes club which is pretty obviously right they reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of move is however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear the drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nWell and just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term as your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n\nDrinking game has played three glasses and a triangle and\nYour plate quarters you know okay it's a quarter scare\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that ah the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups arranging the triangle the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\nRight so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of uh of suggestions about\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups arranging the triangle the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of a a suggestion is about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search\nA books that they have indexed I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports you know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle the way in which Kevin ... alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically a but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says that a devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had me\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing Kavanaugh in his assertion that he never had ...\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabinet and his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drank so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happens if\nYou're asking about yeah blackout I don't know if you\nCan you answer the question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have\nI have no drinking in order to why okay thank you\nSo Chad ... who's a former yell classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking a\n... I I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank there were often times in which he appeared to be incapacitated\nAh and there are lots of suggestions or from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point if it was the case that he with some\nI mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank they're often times in which he appeared to be incapacitated [noise]\nAh and there are lots of suggestions or from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point\nIf it was the case that he with some regularity and high school or gotten drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence the story that he says which is that he doesn't\nHe never I I did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event happened well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and there are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is\nA Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS\nJudge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over\nWell and also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and there are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is\nA Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS if\nJudge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over\nToo they're they're both saying that that line to the committee would be a problem\n... how how is this all playing out among the people that you're talking to at\nThis point well\nThis is one of the sort of fascinating things here is the extent to which the sort of obvious white lies of him\nOr trying to downplay for example is your book injuries are sort of given a pass\nWe sort of established as odd spectrum of these sorts of false words that are are going to be considered a disqualifying for Kavanaugh and that the European countries\nA disqualifying for Kavanaugh and that the European countries may not necessarily fit into that category so it's a real sort of have to see but this is all politics right I mean flakes assertion that that would be disqualifying", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "02"}
