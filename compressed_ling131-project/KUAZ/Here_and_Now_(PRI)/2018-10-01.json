California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag law Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats get an array of ways so\nThis is an unprecedented in terms of him veto doing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto well a\nYou know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm at the Jerry Brown has a governed as say a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise] uh you know\nThat too in terms of human vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto well a\nKnow California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm at the Jerry Brown has a government as a a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise]\nUh you know in this case he felt like it perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh it went a little too too far um and a richer note it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking\nA that a lot of the debate um post a Parkland has focused on\nA these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers you know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a\nGuns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive or for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um\nCalled red flag

it seems that now rather than\nTrying to revive or for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um\nUh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view as their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more ah controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the ... are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in this February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds\nThat's why we will push for and support\nFrom the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in this February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds\nThat's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation in general this policy would allow family members or law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by judge which were prohibited individual\nFrom having any firearms or ammunition if the judge has clear evidence that the family member poses a an immediate and present danger\nUm ah causing injury to themselves or to others individuals with a mental illness should not have access to firearms period\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that his a minus rating from the n._r._a. dropped to a seat as a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact do you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nIndividuals with a mental illness should not have access to borrow\nPeriod that is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that his a minus rating from the un already dropped to ... feet\nAs a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact do you think that that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan\nActually there is a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact on his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady Gibson as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that have been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures they're sensible measures they're pragmatic\nInitial point that I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that have been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies a supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights of of gun owners with uh the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of mine job\nIs getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning saying the second is many Americans are actually a shame\nThat really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these

not been shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions so I certainly applaud governor Hogan for doing the right thing here\nBut I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want and moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nI hear your crews in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents into their constituents I mean blood is a good example of

Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what do you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being

filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our review 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to the a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe\nOf Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws or the minimum
