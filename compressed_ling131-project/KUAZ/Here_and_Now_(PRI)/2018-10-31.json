me dot com slash here and now\nIt's here and now we're following a story involving special counsel Robert Mueller and it's not about the results of his investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations Mueller's office has referred to the FBI that women were offered money to make falls sexual misconduct claims about him\nNPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so are there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller and what may be the case of that woman actually does not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what

actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did they needed listed that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in the special counsel's office that it it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell they are too conservative media personalities capable and jak Berkman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nRight wall is the

and jak Berkman who I had to be linked to the story to tell us about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friend and supporter Chris Reddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose

series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors and models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have a lot less than a minute left so I ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these willing to say something about ... ... what ... what is the possibility here\nMay never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap to try to get reporters to talk about them or none of that is clear
