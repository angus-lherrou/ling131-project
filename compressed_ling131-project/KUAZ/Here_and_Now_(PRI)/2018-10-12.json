but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking tour reported this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nThink that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval\nSo no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns up alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to

Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the U. S. trumping ministry and have to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I wanted there is a counterpoint to this too which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because we have never had a relationship an alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we've always seen them as a strategic ally not as a values based allies in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it in a particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut this is somewhat reflective of what us presidents have said quietly for\nValue since

resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace Meng the ex Interpol president's wife\nIs speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened nephews have do we have a sense that you know of why this is going on and what it is that makes me\nDetained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges he resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace among the ex Interpol president's wife\nIs speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened nephews have do we have a sense that you know of why this was going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means for the larger sense well\nHe's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the Shia government and so there's no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taken as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity um could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalty said their suggestions certainly is that somehow he was less than loyal and the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken\nIt could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalty said their suggestions certainly is that somehow he was less than loyal and the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been ah she's in French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen\nAnd so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use um the public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband then defend her husband it's it's something we don't normally see\nWhat's hard now to Brazil were far right presidents will convict ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the ranks he nearly took the election with

twenty eighth\nWhere we Freidman can you remind us who joy ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nHe's a fascinating character he's been he's a former army captain has been in a Congress for almost three decades um he's a law and order candidate that his his big thing so he said you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police he is very controversial and saying you know the police need to shoot first\nUm and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to loosened gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae beauty um and one other thing that's really important is to Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he has spoken ... um\nAbout the time of the dictatorship as a time when there was law and order one other point to know\nUm and and also to losing gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae beauty um and one other thing it's really important is to Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he has spoken ... um\nAbout the time of the dictatorship as a time when there was law and order one other point to know is that he had an armored with Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations ah you know be nationalistic\nAnd be about cracking down on crime and he has promised to be a really close ally of the United states all of this is\nI'm very a shocking because Brazil for many days for decades has been led by a leftist government uh there was a little more ambivalent about its relationship with the

recession it's embroiled in a massive corruption um crisis that affected all parties except for both an arrow who is actually not been implicated in this and that was his that was hit the winning

the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire early what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of conversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one of these\nAttacks on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase a political ads social media propaganda and

on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers ... books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting the see anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off\nUm it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers eat pull books was attacked but I think um we don't we don't know exactly

manufacture pull books and and a deal with registration databases\nOr electronic publics or what you kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or or or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breach but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was some dinner and it sounded like\nManufacturing pull books and and a deal with registration databases\nI'm trying to pull books or what you kind of what our use their off in a

about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromise\n[noise] well I'm I'm well that's actually quite a controversy or questioned him ... you mentioned\nUm well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um if we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines the systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know voter registration systems which\nI'm I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think\nUm if we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um or\nPotentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer to that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time\nI'm scan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to that Khan um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually and effective attack on them\nUm and you would need some sort of inside job um that would require a lot of attention\nThat have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly um that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines\nUm require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually and effective attack on them\nUm and you would need some sort of inside job um that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nOur they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about\nWhat the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities and are taking 'em um are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing non ...\nHow are they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about\nWhat the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election being there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic an accuracy testing we're doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there were mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of things\nBecause of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing that um there were mistakes made but a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify\nThat the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subjected to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the states to move in directions\nTo make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI I could just jump in real crush point um I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said uh I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um\nI I I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have

my an obvious example is election I reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states\nOr that I Know of but in other countries are election reporting attacked um and um if if you get ... incorrect

twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a feature of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point\nThe agreement ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C.\nIt's widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement ask\nCountries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the inter governmental panel on climate change the IPC see this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more [noise]\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly da Vinci is senior associate with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much you want to send out a shout out to our listeners and with this question as we barrel Tour de one and a half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting\nPort and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is Dr Kelly da Vinci is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living will come back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners and with this question as we barrel Tour de one and a half degree increase in global temperature oh you were each are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to for eight to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at ... fry 'em so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells is\nThat even a one point five degree increase is going to bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think of that small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing too at tremendous extent [noise] so what this\nIncrease is going to bring some pretty big change [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right so the Paris

vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\n'em and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming if you think\nAnd for example\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found\nA for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming\nOn at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer um when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further\nBecause you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses um two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees\nA dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one

half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming\nThree times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse uh under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nKnow does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the back to point zero degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible\nThat under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nKnow does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the back to point zero degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible um there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened\nOn right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nThirty instead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nOn a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can can you answer at least who commission do what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nIt's a which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them we need\nA you know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can can you answer at least who commissioned do what they do they use\nThe shore so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on\nThe scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea um about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is\nScientists basically assess all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the

about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators calm make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n[noise] of oh we're a lot of people want to talk about it I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice [noise]\nYes hello so so I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up\nConfusing but when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in our culture is the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to Yale or in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes\nYes hello so so I'm an agriculture\nAnd I think what ends up confusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people aren't real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in a culture is the high temperature is the record high so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to Yale or in the Central Valley of ... of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American forest grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more of the scientist would talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...\nOther things like that that will instill make us grow more\nPlants and we can have them for food feed him feel I have a you are you a farmer no I'm a\nResearcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy cheaper\nThe atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a

food feeding fuel all in the same maker and it uses little water and nitrogen you know everybody thinks we're going to have some you know put feel to an atmosphere where all the plants will take it up
