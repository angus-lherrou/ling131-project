the art world or a painting to be painted by a non human and then auctioned off like fine art well\nI think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine and hung it on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context that is\nLook at the urine or by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine on hanging on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you price a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so\nHow do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they want him to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nDoes that or just ration deplete\nThey still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market
