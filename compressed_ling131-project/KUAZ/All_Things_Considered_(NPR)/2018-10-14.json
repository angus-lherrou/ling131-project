no\nNo I didn't say that I just said that that that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's what I said yeah well as

get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically\nThe rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T C and gee that's it but he's the problems he like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy pain piles\nOf muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that could generate it like\nHow did this for simple base has become the assets that become hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us\nUs how do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person\nAll the stuff stuff of us comes from ... yeah we have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated like how did this for simple base has become the assets that become hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nHow do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ...\n[noise] this is a code problem [noise]\n... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Gigi ... if you if you take one [noise] and then out comes the protein what\nWhat simple toad could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out two sides I think\nThat ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\nLike instead of eighty\nSo I just need to think of a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Duke ... if you if you take one [noise] and then out comes the protein ... what what simple code could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out two sides I think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\nLike instead of eighty CGI ac ... thought maybe it's a TA C. C. J. P. C. A. A. C. A. G. A. T.\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triple not pairs because if you have sense of three or rather than to the game I figured well that'll give mathematically would give you more possibilities [noise] and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds\nMaking all those hundreds of thousands of proteins", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "14"}
