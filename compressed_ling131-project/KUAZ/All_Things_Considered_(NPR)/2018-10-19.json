happen and they did it anyway it um you know that the deficit is the difference between how much we're spending\nSo let me let me start with you on Monday or the deficit figures from the Treasury

told Republicans is was going to happen and they did it anyway it um you know the the\nThe deficit is the difference between how much we're spending and how much we're collecting how that continuously gross\nFor some reason conservatives have managed to convince Americans that if we collect less money will have more money against all logic so\nNow everyone's and in the Republican Party saying we might have to cut entitlements because now we have this crazy deficit and a more money is going to go to interest payments we can but everybody told them from the beginning that this is how it was going to look\nAnd uh it's just sad that we have this kind of weird cognitive dissonance it\nBears mentioning here not for the first time I was reading your brother originally rooms with the tax cuts have never pay for themselves [noise] ah\nRight as so I think I think that that sort of the great irony in all of this is that um the tax cuts of the G O P push through which primarily benefitted or I

sort of the great irony in all of this is that um the tax cuts of the G O P push through which primarily benefitted or I guess you should say benefited corporation and a and very wealthy individuals the most\nThat in order to pay for those tax cuts uh you have Mitch McConnell talking about cut to rise and rise cuts to entitlement programs\nAnd I think that kind of goes back to the question of

President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a set of his core constituents sore centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help her in the Republican Party in the terms and I'm not who knows who knows\nRight before we sat down here Mattel or announce that it was going to have laugh so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so Oh nice to have the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says is on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment's low we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not like\nWell except for one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from the tax cuts actually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is\nOh nice to have the Americans but wait a second because when the president says is on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment's low we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not like\nWell except for some one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from those tax cuts\nActually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which isn't an indicator that um maybe things aren't going as well as\nA as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow um and\nIt also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to that Joe uh enjoy the fun while it lasts ...\nOn the market thing was I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the ... and we haven't seen for very long time\n[noise] yes I and it's really interesting because the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessors when we have seen depths um I don't really I I and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and financial\nI enjoy the fun while it lasts ... on the market thing was I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the wind and we haven't seen for very long time\n[noise] yes uh and it's really interesting because the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessor as when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really I I and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and fight financial and business experts would agree that the markets are the stock markets are not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see I'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past year\nAnd these are dramatic falls like a\nOther points to the ...

says we are pivoting video at Facebook\nAnd journalism to does what [laughter] journalism pivots what that basically and they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits ... maybe it didn't work out so well\nSo I I mean I think for publishers this was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are they the face but kind of eating into that traffic so Facebook's has represented video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publisher I say OK how high man so they invest all these resources into doing video and then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams are being restructured to eliminate writers and higher video producer is how this happened to places like ah MTV News it happened\nCosts fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are they the face but kind of eating into traffic so I face looks as we're putting video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publisher I say OK how high man so they invest all these

producer is so this happened at places like ah MTV News and having to lock it as\nMike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the reason it's germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook should wait ... these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they less impressive and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of you accounts [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having\nWrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of you accounts [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go round here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't doing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is as close as they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd uh yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though it has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or oh I'm sure to use this word pivoted hum because of what Facebook said to do\nI mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media in dire straits and publishers are looking for\nThey're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that the publishers

Facebook is doing and they think this this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped into both ... what is Facebook opposite first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fraud claims and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took them a kind of building twenty sixteen when these discrepancies kind of first uh emerge publicly\nBut I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that that it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters opening and Gordon and everybody's going to have a [noise] absolutely [noise] Microsoft restrict writer at the very first of all
