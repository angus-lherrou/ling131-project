she works and communications\nWhite women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nThink our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was

happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly is underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turn away from family we show what is\nWhat\nWhy why do\nWe know\nAnd that list of issues important to black one\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turn away from family we show what is us\nWhat is the last\n... wife oh well you\nKnow we only and that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election cycle\nNo one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being a real man black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice\nBits would actually be an urgent issue and\nThat's what it's actually missing is urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI assure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nLike I get up relationships in the middle of it because I Lived in the lethal and the other police officers say something\nLike well he fits the profile ...\nDad he sticks to my brother's six three ... dark skin we didn't\nIssue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing ...\nI asked Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nI wrote a religious in the middle because I was in the ... the other police officers say something\nLife will he fits the profile\nMy dad is six to my brother's history there are all star game we use ...\nLike every day and in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara really right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus\nSay hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won\nAnd of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nBlack women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have

make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone can you talk to the criticism\nAnd justice for all that's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make
