mission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all in the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use ... welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you\nListen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed bottom line\n... of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied them entry based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for firing somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they

United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking\nPoint exactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing fest\nThat's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the

at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle or on you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nHe's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about\nState and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off

American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have racing it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but let's see ... missions has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nLearn missions as a group the ...\nThe students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it\nRacist sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but often times the factory that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what students for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents makers missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in the case of allege that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian American\nAlleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context\nThe kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we are thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea so I think\nThat a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that merits\nThe kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married\nIn the context of economic status or something that speaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of a sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits of it are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on\nThis is really important and it sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits of it are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to realizing admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks so much for having me she's a junior at Harvard and you are listening to all
