City mayor Buddy Guy\nGuy so cats and let me start with you uh and and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about a six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts in it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the the ... to ... capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the ten cents and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nIt occurs to me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three forces right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there is a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\nThe boost to a capital expenditure is was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the fence and we're seeing a slow down so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headlight number was good consumers seem happy\nNew and it occurs me actually just thinking back to our open the show but I should have said that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the ... because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the ... stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking and that is good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some ...\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns slower global\nOf two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do in your voice mail\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears ... point them out well well uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars into the United states because of all these are not mentioning that consumers are going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same all Street Journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been you know like basically in the same breath\nThose terrorists but then he turns road in an interview with Wall Street journal and says church we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been so like basically in the same breath a you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the tears don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that could make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nKnew what to do the right I'm from the wall Street Journal interview and and ah one has to suit its goal is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed chair to budget ... his biggest\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have

to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent at the end of you know is chief us economist at us and the global what you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped

Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has a ... for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on

for Bloomberg walk in the program yeah how are you doing today guy I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes

today guy I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\n... old school sometimes is that\nThe storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server\nBut you know when you need long term archival storage you want something separated from the Internet\nAnd you want something that's going to hold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in and the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because it's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Gen cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah at ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single L T o seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one car crash\nOkay now\nIt's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah ... and she was important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single L T o seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one card cash okay now\nThere's a corporate store you're right there's it Sony and Fuji film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and there's sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H.

before the election you have the introduction of DACA\nThe department of homeland security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people\nWhich really was a huge moment of elation for Hispanic voters and for Latinos broadly who cared about immigration reform\nSo how did these dueling strategies Obama's Ann Romney's work out for each of the candidates when it came to the Latino vote\nWell I think to answer that question you really just have to look at the results President Obama won\nThe Hispanic vote by something like Seventy one percent and Mitt Romney took just twenty seven percent one of the all time lows in presidential election history\nAnd what lesson do Republicans take from what looks to be an electoral blowout when it comes to Latino voters or a little bit\nTo mass focused and not focused and people's hearts that we don't relate to I think average Americans more than we should um stuffy old guys\nThey came out in twenty twelve with the now
