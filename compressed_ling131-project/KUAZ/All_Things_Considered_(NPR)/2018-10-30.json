okay but do we know anything about this purporting plots yes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of a earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual alleged that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nFrom the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here the timing is indeed curious yes\nDetails in her emails that didn't stand up to

interesting gaining here\nTiming is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty sixteen uh a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims it's unclear\nTV or which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a round the killing of a Democratic National

the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you thank you\nEbola has
