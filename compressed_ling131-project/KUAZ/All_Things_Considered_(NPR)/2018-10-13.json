or diagnoses of serious illnesses\nI met with Amanda marks who came to tuna ditto to continue a career in social work that included working with children in pediatric oncology\nShe showed me a few of the more than two hundred paintings that will be on display\nSo it tends to work with children ages three and a half to twenty nine so you'll see pieces of artwork from all those different age ranges\nAmazing and right now we're looking at a piece of our young girl five years old her brother died and here's a piece of art she produced that I kind of ironically called happy can you describe it for our listeners\nStruck me about this piece is like you said the title is called happy yet we're looking at a girl on a piece of cannabis that has a\nJust three and a half to twenty nine so

that I kind of ironically called happy can you describe it for our listeners\nWhat struck me about this piece is like you said the title is called happy yet we're looking at a girl on the piece of canvas that has a sad face with brown hair\nBright colors on her shirt but for some reason this child chose to title her piece of artwork as happy\nAs almost a stick figure but there's there's also

draw your special person you have to paint a landscape it was just this is what this child that I Want to draw this person with a sad face\nAnd this could almost maybe be looked kind of like an alter ego for the little girl of a vision of what she feels like inside her how she views herself\nIt'll depend on how you want to look at the painting is this the self portrait of what she feels on the inside but doesn't project that out for others to see and it comes out on paper now and she's given that time to process and put paint brush to paper\nUm you just don't know and especially with this age group it's just amazing to see what this young of an age group has produced\nThinker brush worth is really expressive [noise] our next age group includes a painting here by eleven year old girl

expressive [noise]\nOur next age group includes a painting here by an eleven year old girl whose mother died because of an accident\nAnd the painting is called hidden face it's acrylic oil pain but it's been manipulated she she sponges to do the background but her attention to form and figure on his face for subject is very detailed and very mature I Would say\nI just think there's so many layers in this piece of artwork so the background is a bunch of colors muddle together with sponge work um to really put the face of the picture in the foreground or the artwork and to make it what you're drawn to when you first look at it\nUm the title is called hidden face and it's just interesting because there is nothing hiding in her face to face as what you see but it's got like a patch of red on her cheek so you will not about if it's a wound that fits a\nScar but that's\nSponge work um to really put the face of the picture in the foreground of the artwork and to make it what you are

her cheek so you will not that out if it's a wound that fits\nA scar but that's also the lip color and one eye as open in one eye is closed so I just think there's so many messages being sent in this piece of artwork\nAmanda there's so much beautiful our work here is so hard to focus on a piece but one that really calls out to me is this one from an artist who is Eighteen years old I'm her brother has been diagnosed with leukemia\nAnd she's produced a painting called depression with hope and their dark mountains in the foreground and a multi colored blue sky in the background and just the mirrors tens of light coming up over those mountains\nI feel like this is a really deeply thoughtful work what would you want to say about depression with hope\nThe color choice allow and just how it lands in the darkness then all of a sudden like you said it kinda brings in that little bit of light ...\nProduced a painting called depression with hope and their dark mountains in the foreground and

the title is powerful enough itself depression with hope\nUm and like you said done by an Eighteen year old girl whose brother is currently going through the treatment for leukemia and just what she must feel like as the sibling going through this process alongside her brother\nSo from our older age group we have a woman who's twenty four her brother died of a fatal asthma attack and anyone living with asthma like myself feels the peril in that [noise] um but tell us what she did in terms of using text in her painting\nReally powerful about this piece of work is the title combined with the tax on the artwork so the title is grief sometimes makes you lose people who aren't dead and in the picture you see black and gold\nWe have a woman who's twenty four her brother died of a fatal

okay I'm Sorry for your loss what's wrong with you\nBy so she's talking about all the people that are banned in her and her grief that left that couldn't handle it felt awkward around her\nAnd says she lost her friends some of her friends weren't as supportive as they thought they were being and I think that this piece of artwork as really powerful about the stigma of grief we don't know what to say and so sometimes we can say the wrong thing or not be helpful when we're trying to be helpful\nAnother phrase that she wrote down here is this is too much for me to deal with I'm tired of this\nI think this is a good reminder of just how resilient kids are um in house\nSome of her friends weren't as supportive as they thought they were being and I think that this piece of artwork is really

going to be self fulfilling and it's just been a reminder for me of just keeping things in perspective and reminding myself to just\nBe there for kids when they need it most but know that they have

is a professor at the University of Arizona school of government and public policy\nI asked to the same question I gave him a letter what happened to the so called sleeping giant of the Latino vote\nWell I mean I think that's a bit of a misnomer there certainly the potential for Latino voters and Hispanic voters all use those interchangeably certainly the potential for them to turn out and vote and really change sort of electoral tie it's the problem is that they don't vote in high rates\nYou can think of a Latino voting is sort of a funnel and so you start with sort of the entire population of Latino voters at the top and then you sort of follow them down by well are they of age Latinos tend to be very very young in this country and especially in the state of Arizona\nSo age knock them out and then after you knock out by age you start to knock out by things like eligibility um so are you a naturalized citizen are you registered to vote is another huge one and then sort of at the bottom of that finally gets rid of the small\nYou can think of a Latino voting is sort of a funnel and so you start with sort of the entire population of Latino voters at the top and then you sort of follow them down by well are they of age Latinos tend to be very very young in this country and especially in the state of Arizona\nSo age knocks them out and then after you knock out by age you start to knock out by things like eligibility um so are you a naturalized citizen\nAre you registered to vote is another huge one and then sort of at the bottom of that finally you get sort of the small sort of trickle of Latino voters who are eligible and then to finally do turn out to vote\nSo they could there on sort of the precipice of being able to change elections but at this point if there's not some sort of mobilization efforts that are really stepped up they're not going to turn out\nAccording to the census about thirty one percent of Arizona falls into that category of Latino Hispanic do we know how many of them are registered to vote\nYes so according to sort of data that comes out of twenty sixteen so it's you know a little bit dated two years I'm so about forty seven point two percent of Latino actually meet the basic eligibility requirements but there's only forty percent of of that thirty one percent that are actually eligible to vote and are registered\nYou're talking a lot about mobilization what is it\nHispanic do we know how many of them are registered to vote\nYes so according to sort of data that comes out of twenty sixteen so it's you know a little bit dated two years I'm so about forty seven point two percent of Latino actually meet the basic eligibility requirements but there's only forty percent of of that thirty one percent that are actually eligible to vote and are registered\nSo you're talking a lot about mobilization what is it that will mobilize that forty percent of the thirty one percent those who are eligible to vote in the Latino community\nThat's the sixty four thousand dollar question um there've been bunches of sort of mobilization drives vote to let you know goes out and tries to get millennials engaged\nNow want to sort of the the interesting facets of Latinos in Arizona is that they're high level of millennials which is sort of a double edged sword right for a mobilization\nFilipinos have lower voting rights and then millennials had a lot lower voting rights so part of it is interesting issues like immigration but you know it's been an issue in the past it hasn't started them before\nSo the question is what will in the future\nKeep talking about the Latino vote and by we I mean you and I and and everybody else out there is it a solid blocks\nThey're high level of millennials which is sort of a double edged sword right for a mobilization Filipinos have lower voting rights and then millennials had a lot lower voting rights so part of it is interesting issues like immigration but you know it's been an issue in the past it hasn't started them before so the question is what will in the future\nWe keep talking about the Latino vote and by we I mean you and I and and everybody else out there is it a solid block or\nIs it more fractured it's pretty well aligned with the Democratic party it's usually a super majority in the sixties and Seventy percent who are you registered Democrats and leaning Democrat\nSo it's pretty solid in that way but that's still leaving that huge block of about thirty percent and a lot of those tend to be independent and those are really the wild cards there's a small portion that are Republicans tend to be sort of from different countries of origin like Cuba some from Guatemala\nOr their ideological divides within the Latino community that account for those percentages\nYeah so they do so part of it has to do with their immigration story the immigration stories for Cubans versus Puerto Ricans who were very similar right they're sort of twins separated at birth those two stories are are very different in terms of one being well\nSmall portion that are Republicans tend to be sort of from different countries of origin like Cuba some from Guatemala\nOr

of having national programs to help them assimilate to us society\nVersus Puerto Ricans who are citizens but still sort of not treated sort of in the same\nIn the same way that you would see you know a good reception and then you think about the largest piece of this which is Mexicans you know they're sort of a new as population immigrant population flow and our oldest and through time they've had\nTrouble with their reception in the U.S so part of it is that it depends on how they received in sort of their socioeconomic status\nOr that are specific issues that will unite the Latino block regardless of the letter after their name the R I\nYes and no so I mean there are certain sort of divides that\nThey're sort of a new as population immigrant population flow and our oldest and through

education in terms of like you know and I think of the population in total everybody agrees education is important but when you get into means that's when you sort of start to divide\nMeans and ends are are very different story even though we can really come together on what we need to do something about education\nTalking with Dr Lisa Sanchez a political scientist at the University of
