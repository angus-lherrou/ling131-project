welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but an airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nFive years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after

better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we\nKeep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that

you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question so\nEven when facial
