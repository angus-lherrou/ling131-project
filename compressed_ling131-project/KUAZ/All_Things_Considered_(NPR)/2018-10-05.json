them right Catherine Rampell writes for the Washington Post Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones everybody\nHigh so Neal it's jobs day you're on that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that ah the jobs report was actually good a little bit of a missile and the number of jobs but but people should be happy with it wages however are another thing entirely still and again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to the markets today you have that right at rages wages where the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained for us in wages as a little bit lower than than last month that but some growth that two point eight percent it was that enough grounds despite\nA little bit of a missile and a number of jobs but but people should be happy with the wages however are another thing entirely still and again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be a market for those people you have that right at wages wages were the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained growth in wages as a little bit lower than than last month that but some growth that two point eight percent it was enough to spark some concern in the market\nThat this would spill over to consumer and prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pickup and grow up with enough\nUh too concerned the markets about inflation and rising rates and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and ah the president and where we stand it is somehow amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA or China is still out there uh we have a still a president or who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on housing\nLet me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and ah the president and where we stand it is some amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA a China is still out there uh we have a still a president or who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with tariffs and counter terrorists and breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um [laughter]\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly a breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure ah is kind of ... there are that that Trump did not break globalization despite his\n\n\n\n\n\nA politics you're being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done and where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's term abrupt\nFor it's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing\nWhich is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened\nTook a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China and the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back and so as much as markets cheered\nThe continuation of NAFTA or some kind of knew named as rose that smells a sweet [laughter] um\nIt's hard to translate a a slow when in North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court ah come you know mother Tuesday\nI Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody's economic agenda because there are things that have to get done writer budget to have to get on there are\nSocial programs and and a foreign bills and all of that stuff still has to be done ... thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller where does things were the things that\nI I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage or and and the presidency as well the executive branch as well\nOr at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around for the last crisis uh\nTen years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's gonna happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones\nKnew what you quickly for sure and I just want to add on to like Catherine I think just said which was you know\nShouldn't suggest that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around for the last crisis uh\nTen years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's gonna happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones knew what you quickly\nFor sure and I just want to add on to like Catherine I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you wanna call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nUh a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are are benefiting we're seeing some wage growth\nUh what happens when the economy naturally turns as part of a natural business cycle well that's when the government plays a role and what we need at that point as a government that functions together for the betterment of the economy and hopefully by then we'll get it\nNew and Richardson a good we're Jones dressing room filled the Washington Post don't you think of a nice weekend one more quick thing about the state of economically right now especially in the lord of the jobs numbers this morning which as you've heard but unemployment in this economy at a level not seen since Nineteen sixty nine year old and with what's been going on in this week in the Baltimore\nThat's when the government playing the wrong and what we need at that point as a government that conscience together for the betterment of the economy and hopefully by then look at it\nThe other Richardson at ah we're Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post thanks you too\nThank you have a nice weekend one more quick thing about the state of economic play right now especially in light of the jobs numbers this morning which\nAs you've heard but unemployment in this economy at a level not seen since Nineteen sixty nine year old that in with what's been going in this week in the bond markets brie and I talked about that yesterday good economic numbers pushing yields that his interest rates higher\nAnd it gets me to this comment from Chris Lowe he's the chief economist at at the end financial he's also a friday regular on the marketplace of mourning report which in most markets was preempted this morning for shall we say other news anyway Chris pointed out to David Brancaccio this morning\nThat Chris works on a bond trading floor and the people in the bond markets\nThey've got a long long memories\nAre really nervous Nineteen sixty nine is remembered as the beginning of the big mistake that led to Nineteen seventies inflation and\nParticularly the older guys out there they don't think dishes at all and moves and but you know what what I like to remind
