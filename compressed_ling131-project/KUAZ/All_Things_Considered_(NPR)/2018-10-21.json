minds and the humans well maybe mimic machines yeah and first up actually I Want to tell you about a a band that I uh that I discovered\nUm I didn't just discover them I just go to them while ago but it still remains actually was at one of the coolest things I've heard in years actually you know this ban I mean maybe you don't know that you know them but we use them in a few shows\nAre in the piece we did in the ... show about the perfect snowflake yes we use them there huh remember the story about the artist to weaponize his own blood yes ... we used in there too\nSo in a subtle way I have already been exposed to them that's what I'm saying although I'm quite certain you will hate their music [laughter]\nIt'd be wrong about that I Will be as generous as I Know possibly how to be the band is called Donna ... dawn of what of nitty MIT I ... do you know what it is\nNo it's a sort of like a computer language for music like in my studio at home I have a bunch of synthesizers and

what it is no\nIt's a sort of like a computer language for music like in my studio at home I have a bunch of synthesizers and various things they all talk to each other using many\nOh the dawn of ... one of those half and half like darn suggests something pleasant beautiful and sort of movie like Mid East technological card cold\nYeah it's actually not a bad place to start [noise]\nOkay so are the ... guys cautious Ronnie he played the bass a amino ... plays the piano costs and not the place of drums are they met in college in ... out of their partnership was not about music it's about tennis began on the tennis courts\nThe tennis court yeah it was funny actually 'cause we would play like late at night that's Akash the bass player customers like stolen the key and kept it or something and one night we were there at three AM and I think we're really drunk and security showed up and he saw as\nThey were pounding the ball back and forth yelling and when he saw the intensity with which we were involved in this mat and she was like you know you guys should continue\nInitially though their partnership was not about music was about tennis began on the tennis courts\nOn the tennis court yeah it was funny actually 'cause we would play like late at night that's Akash the bass player customers like stolen the key and kept it or something and one night we were there at three AM and I think we're really drunk and security showed up and he saw as\nThey were pounding the ball back and forth and yelling\nAnd when he saw the intensity with which we were involved in this match he was like you know you guys should continue to carry on and he and he left\nAnd uh that intensity sort of translate it into the music that they started to play or maybe not the competitive part but they would take it\nReally seriously like what they would do\nIs they get together we go into these classrooms that had no windows turn out all the lights\nAnd they would play these long crazy ...\nIt was completely totally improvise like before they started they would have\nNo idea what he they were going to plan no no idea what type of know how long they were going to go no would you lease figure out who's going to play first no let me just start\nCold cold but it would end up sort of like that three am tennis match really intense rolling rollicking\nImprovisation Daytona\nThe tone or boy I mean I Know I Know I Would just try\nIt was completely totally improvise like before they started they would have\nNo idea what he they were going to planned no no idea what temp up no matter how long they were going to go no would you least figure out who's going to say first no let me just start\nCold cold but it would end up sort of like that three and a tennis match really intense rolling in rollicking\nImprovisation kind of a tone of\nThe tone or boy I mean I Know I Know I Would just try not to use that word or if it's really I like it it's really interesting stuff and like I said we use it\nIn the snow flake story but that's not been\nStyle of music is not actually what I'm going to present to you know it's what they do next that I find totally fascinating\nTo set that up as they're out on tour [noise]\nDoing this free improvisational thing [noise]\nThey were also listening to different kinds of music like they were listening to electronic music\nStuff like a fix when all to one of them gets really deep into trance music\nTechno trends but I'm a lot of music from Africa [noise] West African music as well as music from Morocco\nAnd these are musical traditions that have a totally different approach to rent\nThey were also listening to different kinds of music like they were listening to electronic music or as well [noise]\nStuff like a fix when also one of them gets really deep into trance music\nTechno trance but I'm a lot of music from Africa [noise] West African music as well as music from Morocco\nAnd these are musical traditions that have a totally different approach to read them which we can talk about a second but they're listening to all this stuff\nAnd it begins to somehow see in\nThe beginning of gradually put a little bit of it into their sets and to make a long story\nShort over the course\nOf two years it was a very incremental and slow process they pieced together the style of music that was that as one eighty degrees from what they were just doing and unlike anything I've ever heard the only way I can describe it is it's sort of like\nAncient folk music filtered through highly obsessive computers that actually aren't computers but people what does that mean you're having a place I'm OK okay\n\nOn that but this on his way let's just meet this great\nYou're going to keep an open mind are okay\nDoing and unlike anything I've ever heard and the only way I can describe it is it sort of like ancient folk music filtered through highly obsessive computers that actually are computers but people what does that mean I'm In a place I'm OK okay\n[noise]\nUh no not that this on his way let's just meet this great\nHere comes to keep an open mind okay this is how it starts with a just in a baseline\n...\n... ... ...\nIs it going to develop or are we going to get it it it is just slowly to sway me need\nYour then you do write [noise]\nPianos and he's playing it with his left hand on the strings so he's kind of you didn't get the credit harmonic\n[noise]\nI Know a pot of whales he'll go crazy [laughter]\nI just looked OK you hear the drums are coming here that is\nSlowly just way meaning you're that you do write\nPianos and he's playing it with his left hand on the string so he's kind of using it to create a harmonic\n[noise]\nI Know a pot of whales go crazy [laughter]\nI just looked located near the drums are coming here that the U.S [noise]\nI don't know about you actually maybe I might you are but for me right about now\nI'm getting into a deep trance alright I'll be let let's just don't say anything for a minute and let's see what happens\nThe the the the\nDa da da\nDa da da da da da da\nDa da da da da da\nDa da and like ... ... they're playing real instruments is all performance goes to it but it doesn't sound because\nWhen you listen to\nIt so to get to that you've chosen to Marco\nBoom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom\nThis is a whole lot they're playing real instruments is all performance ... but it doesn't sound because when you listen to it so to get to the children demarco\n\nBoom boom boom boom boom\nBoom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom\nBoom boom boom\nShe'd just there's just slowly of all that but it just keeps doing that for forty five minutes I mean has broken into tracks but it's really just one long I think that that in seismic\nLaboratories all over the world where geologist gather people who have to\nListen to ending earthquakes this is going to be like ignore him in the ... too I imagine that it's small small shifts tiny tiny shit [noise]\n[noise]\nMinutes I mean it has broken into tracks but it's really just one long thing I think that\nThat in seismic laboratories all over the world where geologist gather people who have to\nListen to ending earthquakes this is going to be like the norm in the ... too I imagine too small small shifts tiny tiny shit [noise]\n\nCan you find that could be at all yeah no I Do actually I Do to these guys basically went from like three improv no rules [noise] becoming like human machine it's sort of like wishing to be [noise] an elementary and very funny made Swiss watch\nLike set now and moved to watch I think that that something is going on in the world right now\nIt's a cash against the last ten to Fifteen Years you see it in a lot of fields right now people doing things quote unquote in an analog way that ten years ago would have been assumed were were absolutely like impossible without the aid of technology\nYou see it from a big wave surfers who found out they could ride huge ways their jet skis to pull them in these ways\nTo now saying hey wait a minute we can catch each other\n[noise] I think that that something is going on in the world right now it's a cash again the last ten to Fifteen\nYears you see in a lot of field right now people doing things quote unquote in an analog way that ten years ago would have been assumed were were absolutely like impossible without the aid of technology you see it from\nA big wave surfers who found out they could ride huge waves of their jet skis to pull them into these waves\nNow saying hey wait a minute we can catch each to their arms again but the jet ski needed to be there to show them that was even possible [noise] and you see it um with this this French beat boxer video on line\n\nHe's doing another thing that just sounds impossible it's it's unbelievable and it's like something that like the kind of stuff that a fax was programming for his music but this guy's doing it with his mouth and it's like the computer's showed us a world of possibility and now we're sort of almost realizing that that world is inherent to us in the machine\nThat are the kinds of stuff that effects was programming for his music but this guy's doing it with its mouth and it's like

sure\nDo you ever find a deal though that goes around an iPhone\nOr would be like no Internet\nSure it's in there though you know you don't really have time to even look at what you're doing this like a second what your brain is like\nWhy is this practical product [noise] that sort of like a with her all the time in the background of the most part it's kind of a blur videogame beep baby food\nThe series for like the most popular items that effect for sure\nDo you ever find a deal though that goes around an iPhone [noise]\nThat would be like the Internet\nI'm sure it's in there though you know you don't really have time to even look at what you're doing this is like a second what your brain is like\nWhy does this practice test products\nThat sort of like a with all the time in the background of the most part it's kind of a blur video game the baby food diapers paper towel who was ordering paper towels yeah on the Internet like who's the person who's doing this\nUm and I was hired as a picker because of my youth and my fitness which is to say that I'm not in my seventies\nBecause there were a lot of people in the place who were in their sixties and seventies and really that that old guy yeah this is like old white ladies\nMax's when she talks people about this they always assume the warehouses full of like young Mexican people but it's actually said where she worked was mostly white people and they're primarily older than her I was\nThirty two thirty one at the time well that's why they gave me a job where you run around a lot\nActually um one of the consent form ships on before she was hired it said that we were going to walk\nWho were in their sixties and seventies and really that that I don't know yeah this is like old white lady is\nMack says when she talks people about this they always assume the warehouses full of like young Mexican people but it's actually said where she worked was mostly white people and they're primarily older than her\nI was thirty two thirty one at the time well that's why they gave me a job where you run around a lot\nActually um one of the consent form ships on before she was hired\nIt said that we were going to walk twelve miles a day but going into it I was like cats picker I was actually really excited you know you get some exercise right now my job if I'm not out like actively reporting is sit on my ass right where it hype and stuff\nSo I was like score like [laughter] you know yeah I'm going to do a good job and I didn't think it was going to be with everything in the world but I thought it would be interesting and challenging and I would do a good job and I was so wrong about all of those things [noise]\nFirst of all she says in this particular warehouse and again we can't say which one is nothing was organized than we expected to be like if you're looking for a deal do it would just be in some random box\nThis is like a been full of crap thrown in with a bunch of other things [laughter] so there's a bunch of batteries in there and and I've had anti glare\nThought it would be interesting and challenging and I would do a good job and I was so wrong about all of those things [noise]\nFirst of all she says in this particular warehouse and again we can't say which one is nothing was organized the way you expected to be like if you're looking for a deal do it would just be in some random box\nThis is like a been full of crap thrown in with a bunch of other things so there's a bunch of batteries in there and and I had anti glared cover and then there's ten CD you know whatever product\nSeem haphazardly stored next to each other and that's by design according to this guy Brad Stone I'm the author of the everything store which is a book that look specifically at Amazon\nThere's actually some very sophisticated software that is governing Amazon fulfillment centers what happened to\nSay the warehouse gets a ship in the seventeenth ... instead of taking the builders to like the ... section the computer will figure out how much shelf space\nOr been space those still does need and we're in the warehouse those been our till might say let me put forward elders over here and three over there\nThe invisible hand that orchestrate it's a symphony that as Amazon fulfillment center is called the mechanical sense see the mechanical sense\nFirst of all men centers what happened to say the warehouse get the ship and seventeenth ... instead of taking the builders to like the deal do section the computer will figure out how much shelf space\nOr been space those still does need and where in the warehouse those been our till might say let me put forward dealt us over here and three over there\nThe invisible hand that orchestrate it's a symphony that as Amazon fulfillment center is called the mechanical sense say\nThe mechanical than say\nAnd it not only tracks you know where to put items it tracks what the most efficient routes are for the pickers to go through the shelves and the shortest amount of time\nLike imagine you sit down an order fourteen products at one time with the computer does is it will farm that order out to fourteen different pictures in different parts of the warehouse new coordinate the timing so that each picker is grabbing the item putting it on a conveyor belt in a certain order so that all the products arrive\nTo the same box at the same moment and make sure that\nBox is just big enough but not too big to figure out when to get those boxes on trucks and when the truck should leave and eventually if you believe to be those\nThey will send out fleets of tiny helicopter drone that will deliver your packages to your doorstep at lightning speed no humans involved that's not that's not really happening now\nThe timing so that each picker grabbing the item putting on a conveyor belt in a certain order so that all the products arrived\nTo the same box at the same room it'll make sure that box is\nJust big enough but not too big to figure out when to get those boxes on trucks and windows truck should leave and eventually if you believe to be those\nDistance they will send out fleets of tiny helicopter drone that will deliver your packages to your doorstep at lightning speed no humans involved that's not that's not really happening now it's crazy cat so yet from the moment most of the times I mean they're going to get is from making the human pickers pick faster because if you think about it wants to ... get on trucks\nTruckers are still gonna have to follow the speed limit but there's no ocean laws about how fast you can make people work inside the warehouse\nAnd then we make those people fast with the warehouse Mac work that is my dream like drones\nFor example you're digging through the Ben and you see lots of other stuff but not the thing that you're looking for so\nThese scanners assume you're an idiot and you just aren't seeing it like you can't swear to the scanner that it's really not there so you have to scan every item in the band\nTo prove that it's not their real this yeah the one time that's happened to me I mean it happened to be a bunch of times but one of the times it was like thirty individually wrapped batteries\nPaul you're digging through the Ben and you see lots of other stuff but not the thing that you were looking for\nSo these scanners assume you're an idiot and you just aren't seeing it like you can't swear to the scanner that it's really not there so you have to scan every item in the bend\nTo prove that it's not their real this yeah the one time this happened to me I mean it happened to be a bunch of times but one of the times it was like thirty individually wrapped batteries in this band\nAnd so I have to scan every single one\n\nBefore my scanner will let me go on but I'm not given extra time to do that and my you know my skin or the whole time it's like the two one zero now it's counting the seconds that you're late three four\nDoes it go into the red or something or yeah it's you know exactly how they you are and you're trying to scan your stupid olive oil Mr mixes within the first few hours of her first chip a supervisor with a clipboard came up to her\nAnd said you're only making forty eight percent of your goal because you're supposed to be picking something like a hundred and Seventy items per hour wow it was the first time [noise]\nOne zero now is counting the seconds that you're late three four\nDoes it go into the red or something or yeah it's you know exactly how they you are and you're trying to scan your stupid olive oil Mr nexus within the first few hours of her first chip a supervisor with a clipboard came up to her and said\nYou're only making forty eight percent of your goal because you're supposed to be picking something like a hundred and Seventy items per hour wow it was the first time in my life [laughter]\n'cause I have an over achieving nerd from the Midwest I went to Catholic school you know ... I'm In my life somebody came up to me it was like you're doing a really bad job yeah it was like\nMe birther do she says there's been a little better\nThere was like fifty percent fifty percent of my goal\nI asked my supervisor at one point you know can I ... just like in the middle of the day and he was like of course this is in China\nBut it's gonna hurt your numbers so she thought screw it you know what I'm not going to be I Am going to hold it to launch the minimum shift is ten and a half hours and then that ten and a half hours you have\nTwenty nine minutes and fifty nine seconds for lunch they tell you that are doing not thirty minutes they told us that if it's thirty minute and one second you get docked points\nYou know can I ... just like in the middle of the day and he was like of course this is in China but it's going to hurt your numbers so she thought screw it you know what I'm not going to be I Am going to hold it to launch the minimum shift is ten and a half hours and then that ten and a half hours you have\nTwenty nine minutes and fifty nine seconds for lunch they tell you about one thirty minutes they told us that if it's thirty minute and one second you get docked points\nAnd if you get docked enough points you get fired especially if you knew they told me when I got hired at the temporary staffing agency they had videos about it they had people walking around telling you you cannot miss\nAny time or be one minute late at any point during your first week of orientation and so to sort of illustrate the point the lady leading our training says you know take Brian ... around the back of the room Bryan used to work here and then his girlfriend had a baby\nSo he missed a day and he was fired because it doesn't matter if you have doctors' notes or baby pictures or whatever it is there are no exceptions to this rule and so Brian had to go back to the temporary staffing agency go back through their application process get hired by them clear a new drug test and go back to the train\nLeading our training says you know take Brian ... around the back of the room Bryan used to work here and then his girlfriend had a baby so he missed a day and he was fired\nBecause it doesn't matter if you have doctors' notes are baby pictures or whatever it is there are no exceptions to this rule and so Brian had to go back to the temporary staffing agency go back through their application process get hired by them clear a new drug test and go back to the training that he'd mostly you know already done\nAnd now he's sitting in this group with us and the lady was like oh you're\nWelcome back Brian you know everybody don't end up like\nBrian ... says when you finally make it to launch finally pie\nYou just shovel food into your face while you watch your watch\nAnd occasionally in between chewing people talk and everybody is asking each other why are you here which is like you know in prison\nAnd we actually actually fact check this because I was like the people in prison really always ask each other what they're in for writers or is that in movies and we were in fact checked it and I asked this guy who's been in federal prison he was like it's the only conversation people are having ... remembers that people are table were like\nI got laid off I used to be an accountant I used to be a store manager or used to work in a restaurant\nEverybody is asking each other why are you here which is like\nYou know in prison and we actually fact check this because I was like the president really always ask each other what they're in for writer or is that in movies yeah and we we've had checked it and I asked this guy who's been in federal prison he was like it's the only conversation people are having ... remembers that people are table or like\nI got laid off I used to be an accountant or used to be a store manager used to work in a restaurant all over the place everybody was something else in another life\nMix has on one of her last days she came back from work\nAnd I came home from work and take a bath trying to sort of soak out some of the ... so that it would be prepared and ready to wake up again and do it all over and make my number ... ... you know it was still failing to make and I was describing was one of my friends and he was like how's it going and I was like\n'cause they fired this guy because he had a baby and people are terrible ...\nYeah I kind of a little bit\nI hadn't realized really how mean the system was not just that it was tiring and not just that it hurt your body but that it was\nYou know it was still failing to make and I was describing was one of my friends and he was like how's it going and I was like\nThey fired this guy because he you know the people are terrible\nYeah kind of a little bit\nI hadn't realized really how\nMean the system was not just that it was tiring and not just that it hurt your body but that it was it was me in every way at every turn and then it possibly\nCould be it kind of punch me in the face a little bit\nFor use use that word what do you mean\nEverything from you know scientific breakthroughs technological breakthroughs breakthroughs in the creative arts um and also just kind of ordinary breakthroughs in our lives where we have a good idea what helps us kind of live a little bit better be a little bit better in our jobs you know human innovation\nBut when you use the word you know ... or idea so for most people in the cartoon version that's the light bulb going on so some guy sitting there\nThinking thinking thinking thinking thinking and then they think oh equals mc squared apps and like so\nScientific breakthroughs technological breakthroughs breakthroughs in the creative arts um and also just kind of ordinary breakthroughs in our lives where we have a good idea that helps us in a live a little bit better be a little bit better and our jobs you know human innovation\nSo when you use the word innovation or idea so for most people in the cartoon version that's the light bulb going on so some guy is sitting there\nThinking thinking thinking thinking thinking and then they think oh equals mc squared apps and like so\nFor you when you look into a brain you don't see anything coming out of nothing there's something a little bit more\nYeah that that's one of the biggest things I think you have to kind of undo and when you when you approach a topic like this um which is this idea that the the the breakthrough idea\nThe wife of ... is a single thing happening in a single mind um and and that it happens in an instant for some reason we want to tell the story that way there's this kind of a NATO desire I mean the story teller I Want to tell the story that way too and and people do tend to build these elaborate fictions about their moments of of a ...\nUm but when you go back and look at the historical record and kind of rewind the tape them and play it slowly and so\nOf these breakthrough allegedly kind of breakthrough Tiffany's which you find is in fact that the idea was incubating for very long period of time it actually build upon\nInstant for some reason we want to tell the story that way there's this kind of a NATO desire I mean the story teller I Want to tell the story that way too and and people do tend to build these elaborate fictions about their tongue moments of of a ... um but when you go back and look at the historical record and kind of rewind the tape them and play it slowly and\nSo many of these breakthrough allegedly kind of breakthrough Tiffany's which you find is in fact that the idea was incubating for very long period of time it actually build\nUpon other ideas by other people um it's it's more of a kind of a re mixing of other people's concepts and other people's tools and it kind of fades interview over a much longer period of time is what I call the the slow hunch in the book that\nIt's not this kind of got impression or this sudden you know moment of clarity but this much more evolutionary more more kind of lingering process do you have the sense that there is never a eureka moment or do you have like no one eureka moment and fifty\nSlow small and\nI think that there there are moments where you do kind of advance in in in some clear fashion and you suddenly do see things in any way a lot of them come and dream that's actually the book talks a lot about how many amazing empirical scientific discoveries actually occur to people in in James [noise] but I I guess part of what I'm trying to do with it\nProcess do you have the sense that there is never a eureka moment or do you have like you know one eureka moment and\nFifty slow small in ...\nI think that there are moments where you do kind of advance in in in some clear fashion and you suddenly do see things in any way a lot of them come and dream it's actually the book talks a lot about how many amazing empirical scientific discoveries actually occur to people in in change\nBut I guess part of what I'm trying to do with this argument is to kind of correct that\nThe emphasis replace on those ... and the other thing about those\nEureka moments as if they make and often usually occur to at least ten other people at the same time which diminishes the eureka Guinness\nOf [laughter] ... example for example every single invention that we know about for example the telephone the patents for the telephone\nWhere submitted by Alexander Graham Bell and I'm\nGray within three hours of each other really yes and um [noise]\n... where are the light bulb that we associate with Thomas Edison he was the last ... twenty three other people to be honest you\nKnow like ... ... ... ...\nA lot of a matter of a couple of years life was everybody had the life of idea\nThe patents for the telephone were submitted by Alexander Graham Bell and a\nGray within three hours of each other really yes and um [noise] ... where are the lifestyle that we associate with Thomas Edison he was the last twenty three other people to me you\nKnow like more ...\nThan a lot of a matter of a couple of years life was everybody had the life of idea [laughter] and it\nAnd what what would explain a the sudden ubiquity of an idea after a long eternal silence\nThe precursor\nInventions that are required for that next step have all been done so you it's it's a kind of a like a growth where you need to go through a certain stage\nTo get to the next stage you have to have all the parts and because no idea is alone life all required you know whatever is a hundred other sub inventions to sustain that to even conceive of it and when they are in place and then it's like\nThe next idea is just there and so being too early with an idea is really is bad or worse than being too late and so we\nUse is Kevin and I are both kind of ...\nAge to get to the next stage you have to have all the parts and because no idea is alone ... required you know whatever it was a hundred other sub intentions to sustain that to even conceive of it and when they are in place and then it's like\nThe next idea is just there and so being too early with an idea is really as bad or worse than being too late and so we we\nBoth use is a Kevin and I are both kind of fans are the phrase from Stuart Kauffman the the this idea of the adjacent possible adjacent\nPossible I mean yeah I mean it's just bear with me it's a good for you [laughter] and the idea is that ... at any given time will come on this is very literary crowd so the ideas at any given time both in the evolution of life and in the evolution of technology\nThere is a kind of given the state of the current system there are a finite set of moves that are possible I'm\nSo imagine a like a chessboard right you're in the middle of the game there's a certain number of movies that are possible a much larger set of\nMoves that are not possible I'm the same is true of of you know technologically\nHistory you cannot inventor microwave oven in sixteen fifty just as you cannot event an automobile in in ancient Egypt just to make sure you could imagine\nThe technology there is a kind of given the state of the current system there are a finite set of moves that are possible\nSo imagine a like a chessboard right you're in the middle of the game there's a certain number of movies that are possible a much larger set of moves that are not possible\nI'm the same is true of of you know technologically history you cannot invent a microwave oven in sixteen fifty just as you cannot invent an automobile in in ancient Egypt is to make sure you could imagine one right but you can't build a yes although it is it is remarkably hard to imagine one\nThat's that's part of the point here I mean when I saw this in detail and invention of air the book about your friend Joe precisely\nWho I like the jurors [laughter] fulfill that killed a lot of nice [laughter] so\nSo precisely is most famous for inventing oxidized isolating oxygen for the first time which is another case of multiple discovery with three other people kind of discovered it right around the same time independently more or less\nAnd the point was that they were able to to think about isolating oxygen for the first time partially because they were tools that there were scales and things that made it easier to kind of realized this element was there\nBut the biggest one was a conceptually pushes it they it only had become possible a couple of years before to even think about the air as being something you want it to investigate scientifically\nFor the first time which is another case of multiple discovery with three other people kind of discovered it right around the same time independently more or less\nAnd the point was that they were able to to think about isolating oxygen for the first time partially because they were tools that there were scales and things that made it easier to kind of realized this element was there\nBut the biggest one was a conceptually pushes it they it only had become possible a couple of years before to even think about the air as being something you want it to investigate scientifically\nUp until that point there were like well I Want to investigate wood and bodies and hearts and brains and rocks but\nThe airline is pure was why would why air or whether they're you know and and it was because of a number of big partially because they discovered vacuums where they were like not the cleaners but the empty air that the lack of air that they were like okay this is a vacuum so there must be something in normal air that we can actually study and understand\nAnd so conceptually that became a platform than enabled precisely the kind of think in a way and and his compatriots to think in a way that\nIt was much harder to think even even five decades before ... are you a ... do you think that when the environment\nIs is really\nIn some sense then\nSo it's just almost is is the technique in your face is kind of\nIn normal air that we can actually study and understand and so conceptually that became a platform that enabled briefly to kind of think in a way and and his compatriots to think in a way that\nIt was much harder to think even even five decades before ... are you a ... do you think that when the environment\nIs is is really\nIn some sense then\nSo it's just almost is is the technique in your face is kind of\nYes it is it is it is a a an environment that we're in and it is it's creepy to me is is this ... and\nIt's also because it's inevitable to that's also another creepy a word that people get spooked by inevitable inevitable\nRight you believe that you believe the spoon is inevitable inevitable thing that's bound to happen if you're hungry and you invent soup [laughter]\nSo the question is is I don't think that everyone would think of whom the same time they probably did he wrote a minute let me let me try and we're going to [laughter] so so that the one that\nActive evolutionary theory debate is is something like the ...\nAnd that you believe the spoon is at a never double inevitable thing that's bound to happen if you're hungry and you invent soup [laughter]\nSo the question is is I don't think that everyone would think of ... the same time they probably did his rather than let me let me try and we're going to be [laughter] so so that the\nOne that very active evolutionary theory debate is is something like the inevitability of\nEvolution given enough time evolving eyes light light is the fastest way to transmit information and so the idea is a given enough evolutionary time\nCreatures would have all the ability to kind of process and make sense of uh of light 'em and and to somehow kind of act on that information right and it turns out we find when we go back is that ice independently evolved multiple times in completely different lines\nBecause there was just something about the physics of the world that made that despite the fact that evolution didn't on some level wants to there was no intelligent design or saying eyes would be good a lightweight move very fast that would be a good thing to do but we but evolution kept stumbling its way towards that innovation on these on these separate paths\nAnd I think that's that's where I a hundred percent you know one\nCat as that I wanted to be there\nIs that ice independently evolved multiple times in different lines because there was just something about the physics of the world that made that despite the fact that evolution didn't on some of all want to there was no intelligent design or saying eyes would be good a light waves move very fast that will be a good thing to do\nBut we but evolution kept stumbling its way towards that innovation on these on these separate paths\nAnd I think that's that's where I a hundred percent you know one cat as that I wanted to be there no one said that there was a niche called ... I mentioned we're looking for a ... question which which I think is is real is then how do you describe that how do you describe that inevitability of the system not being directed\nSomehow ending up again and again if you rewind the tape and rent it again you would have ... eyes would just keep showing up\nSo Kevin I think is is pick this provocative but I think useful way of describing and which is if there is this tendency that system to go towards the tractors there are kind of magnets that the system will gravitate towards spoon\nNo food to the point eventually people will invest spoons as well right ones are an attractive Robin Williams will get together what why does bother you so much [laughter]\nI mean I mean how freezing that you are crossing a line here\nIs pick this provocative but I think useful way of describing and which is if there is this tendency that system to go towards the tractors there are kind of magnets that the system will gravitate towards ...\n[laughter] no exposure to the point eventually people will invest spoons as well right ones are unattractive Robin Williams will get together what why does it bother you so am I [laughter]\nI mean I mean fear\nFreezing that you are crossing a line here you are saying that living systems which have a lot of what she describes me well what has that the logic of living systems also belongs to these um inanimate things right the history of technology that sounds like for both of you sound suspicious thing like the history of life\nRight and and I think I'm very suspicious of you you are you yeah you you should be because the ... does not look like sunflower but there there are\nTremendous similarities in in many ways and um\nThere was a famous uh evolutionary biologist miles Eldridge or is he still alive and uh Niles is a specialty is studying tribal lights mapping the morphology of them as they change it can make time to try and when I Try to look like you know he can make\nYeah you you should be because the ... does not look like sunflower but there there are\nTremendous similarities in in many ways and um\nThere was a famous uh evolutionary biologist Niles Eldridge or is he still alive and uh Niles is a\nSpecialty is studying tribal lights mapping the morphology of them as they change it can make kind of ... he can make 'em trees geological trees showing them he's hobby is collecting coordinates\nFrom around the world and hornets as in ... trumpets and so he uses the same techniques um\nApply to the forms of these and actually traces out the little heritage trees they can show that to a rough degree\nThe evolution of these technological forms resemble in many ways\nThat the kind of tracing of of life as a force in species and so there is one sense in which um the things that we make are really just an extension of the same evolutionary processes that made us and that really shouldn't really be a surprise\nThe evolution of these technological forms resemble in many ways\nThat the kind of a tracing of of life as a force in species and so there is one sense in which um the things that we make a really just an extension of the same evolutionary processes that made us and that really shouldn't really be a surprise", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "21"}
