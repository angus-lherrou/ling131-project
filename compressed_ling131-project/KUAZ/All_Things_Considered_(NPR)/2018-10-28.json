love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well\nWere there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go forwards I'd like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you were fighting a cage for defended you're fighting the state and tyranny\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but\nThen he met

other body ... body she was in a cemetery workout headset he left her but our money wasn't there when delta G founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took you know to keep the confidence is over ...\nThe

I was a good lawyer ...\nI thought so art everybody um\nLook feast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job\nA ... I was a good lawyer a research\nBoat so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nPeople think so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation\nI went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this

lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I\nWrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing their mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nTo which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing their mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm a mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had a nice feeling\nAnd she's who our money and build you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what\nIs considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind if not a greater\nConsideration did you did you have a feeling\nAnd comprehensible to me\nAnd the the first thing you'd heard that it wasn't into it when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we will with received a phone call at the unease my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by\nAnd then they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call it the unease\nMy daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just\nGetting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my\nMy father as a matter of
