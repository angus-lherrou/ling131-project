beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nWhen I became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national

like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire me right hasten Harris than to budge on over there and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself\nIn the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything\nIt doesn't exist somewhere within the police for an itself\nIn the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban and his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBird so versed study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records laws and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth

result of that shooting not for\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThink Sir Ben put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of would show that\nWhile back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many documents you think you have sitting on this stuff and it's probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as

thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and and six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen\nSo we did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect was their chase all

like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and\nUm [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agencies keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of

they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year which seems odd because uh\nOrganizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national

a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case huh we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic level\nAre are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found\nA surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody

a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill maybe\nOff their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a\nWeapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us

start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics and you know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nDoesn't tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and it's that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nKnow and we talked with in numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers

more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this methane gas but still just moved by the single cases the individual cases and it's

communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nJust a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that\nYour
