started a trade war I was just is willing to stand up and say no because that is wrong for my state I Believe that your approach should be to just call the balls and strikes\nBut what it shouldn't be is a partisan process and one thing Arizona's no they can count on for me is that I'll never be someone who does what I'm told by party leaders that I Will always and always have put Arizona first

website we've reached out to her opponent Republican Martha McSally multiple times to schedule an interview so far she has yet to take us up on that offer\nThis election season has brought a wave of negative ads aimed at the two women cinema and mix Sally vying for Jeff Flake seat to discuss the overall tone of this election I sat down with University of Arizona professor Cape can ski\nShe teaches political communication and studies public opinion on this US Senate\nRace we have seen some very nasty ads on both sides is this race any nastier than previous races or or we'd just noticing it this year there were probably noticing it for a couple of reasons one reason\nTo discuss the overall tone of this election I sat down with University of Arizona professor Cape can ski she teaches political communication and studies public opinion on this US Senate race we have seen some very nasty ads on both sides\nIs this race any nastier than previous races or or we just noticing it this year\nThere were probably noticing it for a couple of reasons one reason is is that we've been focused on tone not just in an academic sense but collectively as a society we've been concerned about tone as things progressed on social media where people seem to make more statements with less filtering\nAnd so that is changing how we see the civility of how people are supposed to communicate I think the second reason for this race in particular that we're noticing some change is that we have two candidates her females and we tend to hold females rhetorically to a different standard than we do male candidates\nWhy do we hold women candidates at a different standard than male candidates\nTend to do that with male female interactions in general and there's a large body of research when it comes to women and leadership\nI think the second reason for this race in particular that we're noticing some change is that we have two candidates for females and we tend to hold females rhetorically to a different standard than we do male candidates\nWhy do we hold women candidates at a different standard than male candidates\nWe tend to do that with male female interactions in general\nA there's a large body of research when it comes to women and leadership or women inside organizations where when when women makes declared of statements we tend to perceive that more negatively\nThan when men make the same thing now unfortunately for women when men tend to express themselves in motive we we tend to give them high fives when women do the same thing we tend to hold them to the standard of their two week they are not fit for whatever position where evaluating them on\nAnd so women are caught in the double bind and I would say that having two candidates it it's even more exacerbated and so I think that's part of the reason why we're seeing this discourse as um something more uncivil than perhaps what we've seen in other races and those across the country\nSo with two women running and this uh\nHold them to the standard of their two week they are not fit for whatever position where evaluating them on\nAnd so women are caught in a double bind and I would say that having two candidates it it's even more exacerbated and so I think that's part of the reason why we're seeing this discourse as um something more uncivil than perhaps what we've seen in other races and those across the country\nSo with two women running and vis a background the idea of how people are supposed to act in various roles if you will do all these negative ads and does the tone of this campaign hurt either candidate and yet\nIt'll depend on how people evaluate the particular claims made with in the ads\nGenerally speaking we find that negative ads don't really have much effect on turnout one way or the other the thing that has the greatest impact on turnout is how much money and effort and\nYou know eyeballs the ads are actually going on for a given side that's usually the greatest indicator of who's gonna win and not necessarily positive or negative\nHowever the reason why I say that it matters in terms of of the quality of the negative is that we know that certain kinds of\nThat negative ads don't really have much effect on turnout one way or the other the thing that has the greatest impact on turnout is how much money and effort and\nYou know eyeballs to ads are actually going on for a given side that's usually the greatest indicator of who's gonna win and not necessarily positive or negative\nHowever the reason why I say that it matters in terms of of the quality of the negative is that we know that certain kinds of appeals tend to motivate certain kinds of people\nAnd so those kinds of ads that make you angry if you already have a\nPony and the race and so you're a Democrat or Republican that's gonna make you more likely to turn out to vote\nWe had an ad against representative cinema by an outside group and it has the mushroom cloud over Phoenix that's an ad people are talking about is that good or bad for either of the candidates\nWell what the research would suggest that's probably going to be less likely to hurt Martin mix Sally and help her because one negative ads are put forth by third parties or groups outside of the two candidates running\nAny kind of potential backlash is less likely to affect the candidate we're talking\nOver Phoenix that's an ad people are talking about is that good or bad for either of the candidates\nWell what the research would suggest that's probably going to be less likely to hurt Martin makes our eyes and help her because one negative ads are put forth by third parties or groups outside of the two candidates running\nAny kind of potential backlash is less likely to affect the candidate\nWe're talking with Kate ... she's a political communication specialist here at the University of Arizona\nWhen it comes to all these negative ads we always hear that people don't like them they don't like the tone or we reaching a point where things have to come back or two years from now or are we going to be surprised that it was ratcheted up yet again\nUnfortunately I the longer I study campaigns more I think it's the latter it's surprising when you look back at some of that the ads that we're ... for ten years ago Twenty years ago and at the time those ads seem to be rather nasty\nAnd you know by today's standards we look back and we think oh those attacks you know by comparison are are relatively team\nGoing to be surprised that it was ratcheted up yet again\nUnfortunately I the longer I study campaigns more I think it's the latter it's surprising when you look back at some of that the ads that we're ... for ten years ago Twenty years ago and at the time those ads seem to be rather nasty\nAnd you know by today's standards we look back and we think oh those attacks you know by comparison are are relatively team\nI'm not sure what the ceiling or floor depending on your perspective is on this level of negativity and viciousness but it seems that we've always where at least candidates these days are finding ways to to push the boundaries\nWe do know that with the founding of our country there been rules put in place suggesting that\nCivil discourse is important for example you're not supposed to use the word lie or if you're a senator on the Senate floor and the reason is is that the Senate has to be a deliberative body to some extent\nAnd the more we use words that make the opposition um seem less than human the less likely we are to actually have a dialogue and so I Would say if there's one big change about campaigns because of the way candidates and groups are talking to one another\nFor example you're not supposed to use the word liar if you're a senator on the Senate floor and the reason is is that the Senate has to be a deliberative body to some extent\nAnd the more we use words that make the opposition um seem less than human the less likely we are actually have a dialogue\nAnd so I Would say if there's one big change about campaigns 'cause of the way candidates and groups are talking to one another\nIt's that campaigns are no longer deliberative events instead they seem to be you know matches where every what or it's already determined to their their candidate is and they're less willing to entertain possibilities on beyond what they've already decided\nGoing back to where we began this with two women running\nWhen it comes to the tone of this particular campaign whomever wins will have six years on the Senate floor before they have to run again does that tone necessarily carry over to their day to day work on the Senate floor the tone of the campaign and\nI guess we'll ask you to predict what the tone of a campaign will be in six years\nTwo women running when it comes to the tone of this particular campaign whomever wins will have six years on the Senate floor before\nThey have to run again does that tone necessarily carry over to their day to day work on the Senate floor the tone of the campaign and\nI guess we'll ask you to predict what the tone of a campaign will be in six years\nIt's it's hard to say because of the changing dynamics of the the Senate you\nKnow reports seemed to be that senators have less casual contact with members of the opposition outside of their time on the floor\nAnd that's problematic because quite a bit of work actually gets done behind the scenes\nAnd so um we hope it doesn't it was the case in the past that people could have what again at the time were considered nasty campaigns\nAnd kind of get over it at the end have that moment um right after they've won of reconciliation where someone offers you a concession speech that wishes the opponent well and we'll have to see if if those kinds of concession speeches are given this year and not just in this race\nHope it doesn't it was the case in the past that people could have again at the time were considered nasty campaigns and kind of get over it at the end have that moment um right after they've won of reconciliation where someone offers a concession speech that wishes the opponent well\nAnd we'll have to see if if those kinds of concession speeches are given this year and not just in this race but across the country because without those kinds of moments I think it would be for telling for a U.S Senate that basically um is one that isn't a deliberative body do we see\nIn races like this one most of the negative ads coming from outside or from candidates\nIt depends on the the race itself when races matter to the national parties over all you should be seeing more third parties coming in it and trying to intervene because again it matters more beyond the race itself\nIt comes to negative ads and the next campaign ah when the winner is running again for reelection or maybe the person who loses is challenging again do any of those negative ads stick from the previous
