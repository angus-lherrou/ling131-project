members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend\nAnd for you in this trade agreement ... holding a rough to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum a so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have

there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum us so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be ... material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel\nChuck Lorre burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a

NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to ... the only under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steal more aluminum that's from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have to see a ministry of cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge as we move forward\nFires and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there

also see a situation in which a senator might say look I Believe his denials about the sexual misconduct I don't think he tempted to rape a woman I don't think he exposed himself in a dorm room but I also think\nThat when he sat before us for several hours in the Senate Judiciary committee and downplayed his drinking and now I've looked at all these interviews and then I see the testimony of people saying the opposite and I don't believe him\nAnd just the fact that I Believe he misled the Senate committee could be enough for this particular senator or that particular senator to say I

something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this
