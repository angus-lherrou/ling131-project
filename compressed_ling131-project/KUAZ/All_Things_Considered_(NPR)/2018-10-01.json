October good as always to have you with us\nAnd we start today with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach

strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\nManufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs around the center of the rhetoric of everything and the ... and ... were a lot of jobs in ...\n... we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott Lizzie manufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so let's take automobiles auto jobs around the center of the rhetoric of everything and the and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so a few simple let's say you assemble cars of trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW\nRight now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico or the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yup was set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanctions or the or else that you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone right we say that in my house while the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you made cars in Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and his bureaucratic\nThe ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanctions or the or else that you have to do these chores or else I'd take away your phone like we see that in my house while the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make cars in Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain and finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and his bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent in since uh non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China\nAnd more jobs in Mexico or let's say OK I followed the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars in sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect out of jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour\nThere's still says a large percentage of each vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour\nGo up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect out of jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour to fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who makes sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what companies do when we just got pushed up will sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw afterward and more robots more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly take 'em all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table and it's a little confusing what's here and what's not\nYet so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security soaked Canadian steel Mexican steel still subject to that and it's more it's complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles coming as well\nWell so looking a little more broadly doesn't take up all of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table um it's a little thing what's here and what's not\nYet so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel\nMexican steel still subject to that and it's more complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles coming as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration and that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd filing is interested in here in D.C today what are the chances this all gets approved by Congress\nWell good luck Lucy predicting now a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats could we will take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support whether they're going to do the president a victory that's a different question\n... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history questioned for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market

is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think that people around you um are you know X handling a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important market for\nUs agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and\nWith the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico had established to tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nDon't last time you were on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year as that ship friday sale\nWe're hoping that export levels will return to\nTariffs on us apples and

were\nImposed that movements slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting here thinking this is Jess ... again or are there differences that you see I mean how does this plan for you on the ground at the same thing with a different name\nDoes

department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time creating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments\nWith the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one\nLearn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them and the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration alternately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about so\nThe department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo there's shock there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says\n... what what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about so\nDepartment of energy could just as easily be called the department nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but\nHe comes for an hour listens politely and leaves and and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from their especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency is supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example or inside the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is\nAn active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather\nSo it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if\nWho's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in this administration and the way it's running the government that it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term\nAnd I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs you know we have an interesting problem\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or so and those are people who have made a career out of those are people who really know\nReally know the jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house too\nA hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ...
