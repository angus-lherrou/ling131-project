boom got his hosts barber Peters also known as baby and Andrea good marks to join me to share how they brainstorm about such a deep range of subjects\nKnow it's hard to put a a top on the pot\nBecause

the construction it needs to be stretched out for multiple years so you'd see you know these jobs being stages not all built in year one things like when they have jobs that tend to stick around a little longer 'cause wind farms have moving parts\nAnd their their tend to be more jobs from megawatt stick around long term a lot of the you know assumptions that go into a the various models I think I saw anywhere from people\nIt's not it's not near as many jobs as the construction the building of the solar farm\nAnd these will be stretched out so the construction it needs to be stretched out for

estimating that it will reduce bills or maybe increasing by you know a few dollars to all the way up to two thousand some odd dollars per year\nPredicting that future is is really hard I Would probably pay more attention to the models that you can actually see the underlying analysis oh so you can see the results they shouldn't be that complicated can you talk\nAbout the role of natural gas in terms of driving down demand for coal and other things and are those changes that are taking place without a push for renewable so are these efforts relieve unnecessary\nSince fracking has come along the you know the price of domestic natural gas has just plummeted actually just a couple of months ago the U.S became a net gas exporter for the first time since Nineteen fifty seven I mean we have so much gas and the price is so low right now that it's just cheaper to generate electricity\nSo in terms of driving down demand for coal and other things and are those changes that are taking place without a push for renewable so are these efforts relieve unnecessary\nSince fracking has come along the you know the price of domestic natural gas has just plummeted actually just a couple of months ago the U.S became a net gas exporter for the first time since Nineteen fifty seven I mean we have so much gas and the price is so low right now that it's just cheaper to generate electricity from gas and it is cold\nA lot of coal plants retiring just for the fact that they're all they're being replaced with gas you can do gas for about a third of the cost it's twice as efficient and you know the feels about the same cost and its flexible which also comes in handy when you've got a bunch of renewables on the grid\nAlthough you know it has um diminishing returns you know every time a gas plant replaces the coal plant carbon emissions goes down but I guess still does produce emissions\nAnd so we can only get so far with the gas so if we want to go further we either need to employ some kind of you know carbon capture technologies or we need to employ technologies that don't produce a C. O. two when they make electricity\nWe're talking with Dr Joshua roads and energy researcher at the University of Texas at Austin where does Arizona fitting nationally when it comes to renewable energy goals\nSo the proposition one twenty seven past it would put\n... emissions and so we can only get so far with the gas so if we want to go further we either need to employ some kind of you know carbon capture technologies or we need to employ technologies that don't produce a C. O. two when they make electricity\nWe're talking with Dr Joshua roads and energy researcher at the University of Texas at Austin where does Arizona fitting nationally when it comes to renewable energy goals\nSo the proposition one twenty seven past it would put Arizona tied at second place as far as ... I think Hawaii is the only one I think they go up to Ninety five percent so if this passes it would put Arizona pretty uh pretty up the curve in terms of a generation of electricity from renewables\nDo reports released a like the one everybody is talking about by the IPC see in the un raising the alarm about climate change make a difference in the white people and voters think about this type of ballot question\nWhat would hope so climate change is a really big problem that we're gonna have to deal with and I mean we're charging that interest on credit cards that you know we're not going to have to pay for you know a little while longer but once once it comes it will be expensive so\nI Hope it something that uh that people are paying attention to there's so much happening today in the news with you know all kinds of things particularly at the federal level that some\nClimate change make a difference in the white people and voters think about this type of\nBallot question what would hope so climate change is a really big problem that we're going to have to deal with and I mean we're charging that interest on credit cards that you know we're not going to have to pay for you know a little while longer but once once it comes it will be expensive so\nI Hope it something that uh that people are paying attention to there's so much happening you know today in the news with you know all kinds of things particularly at the federal level that some of this you know might get lost even though it's you know the world's most brilliant scientists saying hey we've got a problem here we need to do something\nA number of states as you mentioned have similar things in law about using more and more renewable energy what is the critical mass of states when this goes to federal or more and more states just start picking it up because\nThey have to so there's a couple of dozen or a few dozen over thirty states that have RPGs uh goals out there some have already been met and uh some are still on the books are somewhere getting stricter\nSome states have started with you know a a low goal and then have tightened it up over time so any state that does not have some sort of R. P. S. as in the minority now\nBut again some of those states have already you know already surpassed that they're not there is no mandate to go in\nJust start picking it up because they have to so there's a couple of dozen\nOr a few dozen over thirty states that have RPGs uh goals out there some have already been met and uh some are still on the books are somewhere getting stricter some states have started with you know a a low goal and then have tightened it up over time so any state that does not have some sort of R. P. S. as in the minority now\nBut like in some of those states have already you know already surpassed that and they're not there is no mandate to go any further in some states where even where the mandates have not gotten any further they're continuing to build because society wants that\nA lot of corporations these days are driving renewable or investment so they're wanting you know to say\nWe run on a hundred percent renewable energy or this product is created are built with renewable energy and so you know those kinds of you know values that are being injected into the system are also having measurable impact so it's not just states driving this really we're seeing a lot of the private sector drive in it\nAnd I don't know that we'll see any federal driving of it anytime soon the governor\nRecently admitted that he signed a bill passed by the legislature this year that would essentially got one twenty seven if it passes isn't that surprising you know it's not surprising that a bill that would have\nSystem are also having measurable impact so it's not just states driving this really we're seeing a lot of the private sector drive in it and I don't know that we'll see any federal driving of it anytime soon the governor\nRecently admitted that he signed a bill passed by the legislature this year that would essentially got one twenty seven if it passes isn't that surprising you\nNot surprising that a bill that would have been put through so I Believe if I'm correct it it basically stipulates that if a utility does not meet the requirements put out by proposition one twenty seven that they would have a very minimal find some sort maybe just a few thousand or a few hundred dollars but the interesting part here is that\nYou know while a law like that might stand for an R. P. S. that was either just a a regulatory construct or was a a a regular law passed\nI think it becomes part of the Arizona constitution I think I Would think that would open it up to to quite a bit of court challenging I think it'd be probably really easy to challenge I mean I'm not a lawyer\nBut courts are there to interpret the law and if that is you know part of the law in a particular part of the constitution I imagine that type of law could be easily ...\nThey're just a a regulatory construct or was a a a regular law passed\nI think it becomes part of the Arizona constitution I think I

and if that is you know part of the law in a particular part of the constitution I imagine that type of law could be easily overturned and it probably would be challenged almost immediately if one twenty seven passes\nSo are there any downsides to this type of a proposal when it comes to the technology side\nOf the downsides with ... or ... or a nouveau portfolio standards as it it can limit you in the technologies that we've got if we're really serious about trying to fight climate change which is you know it at its core what these things are about\nWe might want to consider broadening the scope of what technologies are available so\nWhat California did a little while ago there there are more recent law is just carbon free electricity not specifically renewables now may turn out that that becomes just renewable but you know allowing things like either nuclear or carbon capture technologies can give a few more tools and the tool box that might make it a little bit easier to meet those goals\nYou know it at its core what these things are about\nWe might want to consider broadening scope of what technologies are available so\nLike what California did a little while

public money out of party politics opponents argue however it will weaken the authority and independence of the ... elections commission\nA yes vote would put the clean elections commission rulemaking authority under the regulatory oversight of the governor's council and prohibit candidates from transferring public funds to political parties or politically driven organizations\nA no vote would leave the commission's independent authority as is and allow the commission to determine whether publicly funded candidates can transfer those funds to political parties or organizations\nAnother high
