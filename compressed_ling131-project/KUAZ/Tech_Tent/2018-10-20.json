smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one businesses trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones ... is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the farmers used to see you can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and and I asked him what kind of people used it\nGuess their primary level we're targeting people here don't have those other ways of communicating with each other so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia who have no connection to the Internet and

the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africans East Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information the knowledge and how to improve their farmer or bottle a disease now so we farm or we need all those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or ... or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology is SMS this does that ... well\nIt's it's simple in the front and a son that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty character is it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get good content people in such a simple format\nAs so when the former U.S a question uh for example on on SMS we'd unease machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis\nSimple in the front and a son that's a mess is obviously a hundred and sixty character it's it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get confidence people in such a simple format\nOr so when a former U.S as a question uh for example on on SMS we don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis too much them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question\nAnd get this book content back to the original farmer\nNow you'd you'd go to a million members I think you just signed up a million the millions member walk\nWhat evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people [noise]\nYeah so it would pass a million which is is obviously a great milestone for us having to one point two million I'm I mean I think that the force than biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched\nUm so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know it in context is is probably in your seven or eight percent on Twitter um you know we know protest more than a million questions than answers every single month which gives you an indication of the level of content or we farmers in the ...\nHaving to one million I'm I mean I think that the force than biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with his for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know in context as is probably nearer seven or eight percent on Twitter\nAnd you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month a which gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fun systems here there's not a social system itself I value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicated he would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they are using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally hound information it's helped them save their their livelihoods and farms through we farm it was an example of how it's being used\nA ... I mean the example I gave is that there's a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called ... he kept on the in the region of of fifty chickens I'm as and this was his entire livelihoods you know paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table\nOr on a disease was ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this on we farming\nIf um you know literally had information to help them save their their livelihoods and farms through we farm\nIt was an example of how it's been used a ... I mean the example\nI gave is that there's a a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called ... he kept on in the region of of fifty chickens I'm as and this was his entire livelihoods you know paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table\nOr on a disease was ... it has killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this and we farm and go get information back a which vaccines tears I ... I just thought the disease spreading I managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of vital\nYou know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental these farmers but that we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny you in from we from a Mona El Salvador from New York City in ... in a special guest uh\nUh that was one of those red now public a positive stories about social media or five years is a guy I run the social media was going to save the world that was it was a positive uses we've probably change timely yes\nTo Santa and live in ... the year we celebrate in social media we thought it's getting to the world it enables people and a three regimes to move to towards democracy\nA Mona El sol from ... in a special gifts to a that was one of those red no public a positive stories about social media or five years or so ago everyone the social media was going to save the world it was a positive uses we've changed our way yes\nTo sound to live in was the year we celebrate in social media we thought let's go to the world it enables people and other retail regimes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nIt was the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activist real people are very very few\nPeople doing practical things like that yeah ...\nExactly will use social campaigns to reach people over and it's about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit\nSo it's now battles between two items the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now are talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together so have many many many positive effects but of course the propaganda against the highlight of the time\nWe started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit so it's now a battle between two items the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them\nSo this is why we now we're talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together still have many many many positive effects but of course the propaganda gets the highlight of the time\nUh I mean ... still very important um I ... it is connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we're getting more good than bad from it\nWe're still getting good but we are getting better now in the last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have to do that we're getting all the good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated and make sure it's it's under control maybe we don't know\nOne very brief would use every climbing or you still positive about social media\n[laughter] I think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think there's a lot of goods that comes out but it's not I for one love it\nAll we got time for anything on the positive effects more special guest Mona El soften the also the enjoyment Institute thanks very climbing read over stories and moaning\nNow we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated and make sure it's it's under control maybe we don't know\nOne very brief would use every Kleiman used do positive about social media\n[laughter] I think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think there's another gates that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat's all we got time for anything on a positive ... thanks to my special guest Mona El soften the opposite ends of the Institute thanks does every crime and read the stories and moan at BBC dot com slash technology and I forget to join us again\nIn the tech tent at the same time next week [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
