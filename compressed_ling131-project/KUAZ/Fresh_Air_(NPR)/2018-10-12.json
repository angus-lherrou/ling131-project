friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood\nAs one of the first animals that went into space wow what got you fascinated with study scar\nThough I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and I knew that I Want it to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in [noise] so\nWow what got you fascinated with study\nScores so I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in so off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started wow\nMy show how many do you study how many of the group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nIn the wild [noise] um I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow my ... show how many do you study how many of the group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSome squirm one of the challenges of working with squirrel monkey says that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar\nBut there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality uh yeah they do stand out okay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nOkay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM there already\nIt's not that easy to individually identify them a particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life of a score I'm like OK so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping\nTree and uh they spend a lot of time active or all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we follow them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven ...\nFor their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nSo grasshoppers are one of their feet\nBut rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter] um and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven ...\nFor their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating\nGrasshopper yes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshopper sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd with the head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes\nAnd they seem very happy while they're doing it wow\n[laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a Washington is right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular\nAnd then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it wow\n[laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a ... [noise] wait why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low\nAnd once the adult lost desert the nest the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow for their pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] those watch for not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\nAre [noise]\nAnd patient inpatient [laughter] those watch for not leaving so right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of of the other one of the spider ... let's let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nI ... I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I can recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver yeah um but when there's you know ten of them in a treats kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nMhm we have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contest\nYou know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I Can't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver yeah um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's the sad that we hear is that rises ... this usually this is those a squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nMight it might be birds actually because\nWild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies have jungles or you know that that ... that we hear is that rises to this usually this is those a squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because once you sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of\nBird how hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference in the study that sounds to me\nIt's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and he knows everything about square monkeys and so he can\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and he knows everything about square monkeys and so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nAnd how long have you been doing that for\nA little longer he started with with ah a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing it for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well do you call him a yes sometimes he does he like he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language for evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nYeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in social\nYou can learn about human language

research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me you know I just I just said it but but salmon living impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys take\nThat is pretty impressive and their journeys can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds ...\nAnd and they usually hedging these are these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct [laughter] and they don't just have to navigate up steam may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThe ... same and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams

upstream may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this they they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nThis ah same and have a diverse array of tools that they use\nIn order to navigate and so when they reached streams are they generally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\n... now I Know do your research is looking at a different group of salmon be lapped examine what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our

correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field

lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the pools and shallower at the equator\nAnd both of these components predict or favorably are predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they form a type of vi coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals

one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species\nHave tiny chains of magna tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property\nAnd so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields and so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action

winds may be important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it land examine\nAlso possess disability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps and a lot of diverse ... amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic\nEnvironments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can

my basic physics you know in grade school them if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf there were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains\nOf tight right that somehow connect with an herself right and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina\nYes so we are present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of NATO tight right that right somehow connect with an herself\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nThat's terrific and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer course scale to maintain a resolution of those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale the night ...\n... so what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nThat we have a whole number of ... of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look at night magnetic resolution of this map\nSo having a series of points moving them closer and closer together and to see how fine or course scale their responses actually are\nSo uh could could you save endangered salmon man by knowing more about them\nMean it always helps to know more information about us bases that you're trying to conserve them knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and probably a tool and Sam and conservation but certainly not\nTogether and to see how fine or course scale their responses actually are\nSo uh could could you save endangered salmon man by knowing more about them\nI mean it always helps to know more information about us bases that you're trying to conserve them knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and", "year": "2018",
