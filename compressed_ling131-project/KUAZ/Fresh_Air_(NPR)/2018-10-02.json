from Asia has been\nConstrained this has been the most short sighted of strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right

most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we have used\nTo go after them have been quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government they encourage the Chinese on a road\nTo self sufficiency and independence from the United states\nWhich ultimately will reduce our leveraging influence they fail\nTo mobilize the moral and political force\nOf the entire international community which is surely the most effective way to influence Chinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues\nDo our leveraging influence they fail\nTo mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community\nWhich has surely the most effective way to influence Chinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about\nChinese trade practices and in particular the ones who are relating to intellectual property but I don't think\nThe strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize\nLong run American interests and what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these tariffs that we're collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China there are all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want\nTariffs our taxes they are taxes\nThis fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs the companies need in order to compete\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China they're all kinds of ways of raising taxes\nIf you want tariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods\nThat people buy and the inputs that companies need\nIn order to compete that's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient and so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on\nCutting the taxes for corporations\nAnd raising the taxes\nOn uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas\nSo are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being tax cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican craving this in front of President Trump\nAnd raising the taxes on uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids at Christmas\nSo are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being taxed cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI stopped being surprised at Republican\nCraven this in front of President Trump is clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist\nBuddy it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge\nSponsored and supported by President Trump and President Trump may not have a majority within America\nWith him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party and he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline\nAnd therefore he is able to a\nRally Republican congressmen\nAnd President Trump may not have a majority within

inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to recognize that any error and letting inflation rise a little bit too much\nIs likely to be a reversible error at any error in terms of tipping economy into recession\nIs likely to take a very long time to reverse\nI'm One who believes that we have a very different economy than we used to therefore I think the approach that's being pursued is okay and I would not be one or to criticize it

banking industry at a major bank and and he was saying that the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where\nInflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nIt's possible uh there is some evidence that\nAt the end of expansions\nThere's a tendency for

wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let's got tell it he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome I thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast was one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete ad me what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives you move you\nStarted saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on the podcast that was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking\nHe asked me what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a ... change your lives she moved you started saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on that podcast\nThat was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalk about the stress as you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the ... nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was was there that kind of escalation going on\nExactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nAnd our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things\nIt was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nIn our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves up moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know I'll be honest it\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as what was so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at her retirement calculator\nSo uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes I realized that we could ...\nAnd the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plugged the numbers into what current spending was it\nLooked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties and uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that's what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really liked my job and it for me it's not about work for me it was about uh bring myself from\nThis idea of mandatory labor you know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all and you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world\nFor me it was about uh bring myself from\nThis idea of mandatory labor you know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what you and your wife did just to keep the story going his way it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage\nYou move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement\nHas been true just replace your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant true is that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retire doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that and we should\nSo you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replace your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant trees that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retire doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels uh this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest breeze to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance\nBut the yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible\nPeople decided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough\nThat the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game and have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nGates ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible\nPeople decided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough\nThat the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game and have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race one\nOf the the main draw for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial adviser you're sexually betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big dips and dives\nAnd if you can ride those waves if you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a nice entry point for me\nWell and part of this in order to do this and there's a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nWhole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent\nIts history has always gone up now it goes through these big Gibson dives and if you can ride those way that you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that took when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a a nice entry point for me well\nIn part of this in order to do this and as a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you

the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable what were some of the things you were doing [laughter]\nI mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know an adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for a year we we actually we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much
