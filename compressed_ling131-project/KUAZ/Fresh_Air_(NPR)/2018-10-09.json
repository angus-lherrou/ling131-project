I think we are all here yes S. Justin Paul hello there even learn saying hello\nThen I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIt's not directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and he passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were a myself included\nAnd I was sort of struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like a our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that\nFurther well but in this case evidence in a he's a kid that just gets up every day China have a better day in fact\nMonster nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would inserting themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further well but in this\nCase Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling themselves about how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presents his kind of a bully\nHe finds one of the letters takes it home after he kills himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan

suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything you've always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well my mom she feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans have been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they can\nOf their son who of course isn't I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear haven't mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that

talked about at the beginning of the process with Val which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments in the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nIt is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book\nAllows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and uh and same token we also felt like we want to just to be a different experience\nWould become a sort of temple moments in the musical how do you take that in translated into a book it is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as as a novel because\nThe book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves I should say okay every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and then also had sweaty hands\nRight he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty hair becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before where I felt like I\nCan your hands I'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue and the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and they also had sledding hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before here I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to have and and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you Erica I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize yes\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know I'm just the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um\nYou got I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize that's\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't want to get anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYeah this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a\nThere's a him taking his life I'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't want to give anything away but I have to say we actually find out is ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about counter but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine\nMore about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it is that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does and it was important to us that it not feel mano causal\nI'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nAlso feels like a cautionary tale for times of what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media ... and his friends become\nGoes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does and it was important to us but it's not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does you know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're you know doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't Paul I understand that while you debated what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it fan fiction they were they were writing about Evan and Conor what might happen\nThis is Justin you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing a novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fans around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listen to the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and they were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and and\nThe book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing
