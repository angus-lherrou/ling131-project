about Thirteen billion dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a now about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments in the U.S

been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us\nTreasuries yeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nThese are the two biggest foreign holders of U.S government's securities they could if they wanted kind of hold us hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis\nThey really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very threatened by too strong a dollar so it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars of arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard

that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nWhere does some of these is because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just that was so much debris down they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped and so they were not

they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... have in the day for his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late Nineteen century\n... they were arrangements that were made this piece went viral and it's time you could say there were range means for\nA Mendel Lynn's for piano for saxophone for ... choir with a Latin text added\nBut
