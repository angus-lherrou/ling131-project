on\nIs the one instrument is going to look at the fundamentally a nonstop our sources planets stars embedded in dust\nGalaxies with a huge miles of star formation in them most of the honor of which are energy of which comes out with dust active nuclei from black holes and so on\nTell me a little bit about what the biggest challenges of the James Webb space telescope are\nWell the biggest challenges we wanted a telescope that was too big to big because it won't fit within a rocket faring so there's no way to launch the telescope without having it falls out so the whole telescope has to shrink down fold up get in the rocket get in space\nEnergy of which comes out with dust active nuclei from black holes and so on\nTell me a little bit about what the biggest challenges with the James

you move the segments and the telescope the marriage made of many different pieces get those segments wind up to make a good image\nThere's another challenge which is as an infrared telescope so it has to be cold\nYou said that uh in infrared telescope has to be cold how cold does it have to be well this telescope\nItself is forty degrees Celsius above absolute zero recall it forty degrees Kelvin in Fahrenheit that's like sixty degrees above absolute zero so it's like minus four hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nAbsolute zero is the lowest temperature you can get to temperature is new to the

in Fahrenheit that's like sixty degrees above absolute zero so it's like minus four hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nAbsolute zero is the lowest temperature you can get to temperature is new to the vibration of molecules and absolute zero is one that stops\nThe telescope gets there by just radiating energy into space\nThere's no actual mechanical cooler that cools down but spaces even colder and so if you just build and right you can lose the energy to space and yet poll the only exception being the instrument that I'm involved in which has to have a cooler to get down to just about six degrees above absolute zero\nDoes this mean that the telescope has to have big Sunday shades to keep the sun off the back end of it the sun shade as as big as a tennis\nCourt and it has many different

on for all like a window blind when you get in in space and that's proven to be a really big engineering challenge\nThe particular kind of light that you're looking at the mid infrared why is it that you are so interested in that\nSo Mitt infrared lets you look at for example planets around other stars or asteroid belts around other stars so it's part of the big push in astronomy to find other planetary systems\nIs also it turns out most of the energy of very distant galaxies that are still forming comes out in the infrared so if you want to study them this is where you have to lower costs lots of other things I could go on until midnight so maybe I'll stop here and\nWhy do you have to have the mid infrared portion of the telescope colder than the rest\nEverything radiates in the infrared and the the Cold War it is\nIt's also it turns out most of the energy of very distant galaxies that are still forming comes out in the infrared so if you want to study them this is where you have to work or course lots of other things I could go on until midnight so maybe I'll stop here and\nWhy do you have to have the mid infrared portion of the telescope colder than the rest\nEverything radiates in the infrared and that the cold or it is the longer the wavelength that it radiates out so we want to cool the telescope down so the\nRadiation of the telescope is longer and lower than the radiation or looking at from the astronomical objects otherwise and we'll wind is All right thank you for coming in George You're welcome [noise]\nThis is Tim swindle and this has been Arizona science

end up in these developmental chambers along with the developing beetles and um we didn't know before whether that was a good thing or a bad thing um but we did know that um\nThat this association existed and so this is something that we wanted to investigate more to understand the consequences of that interaction for comic tell me what did you learn\nWell um we we looked at all in all different parts of the um ... and we found them on various parts but we're particularly interested in is really high concentration of nematodes it's found on the genitalia um it's a good place for ...

peanuts\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery has really taken off instruments like Kepler and the Newark test had been racking up the planet count\nBut this week astronomers writing in the journal science advances brought the whole thing to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet but eBay moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler sixteen dash twenty five dash be and his some four thousand light years away how\nDid he do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex ... cheese and NSF graduate research fellow and the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome to science friday thank you very much for having me first what what moon is is we're ready to give us a little\nThumbnail description sure yeah so it's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there\nAre a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of the moon to the size of the plants\nSo the size of the planet is ah about the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive\nWe can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there are a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange\nUm orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do so but so what is the relationship with the size of the moon to the size of the plant so the size of the planet is ah by the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell\nA and then the moon is uh like you say about the size and the mass of net but even at a pretty unusual well known that big a well it certainly unexpected right where if you look at the moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than New York so\nUh when we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat are sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is orange\nThis is what it looks like about the size of Neptune that are sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is so large\nYou know because we think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a peace it doesn't look like that in this case uh yeah\nIt's funny you know there's so there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact or scenario like how we got earth's moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planted in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like a Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ... [noise]\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads\nOr but yeah and we like it when they\nDays of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus and then finally a capture scenario like a nap tunes largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads a little\nBit yeah yeah we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but about detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nYeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks out some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet and so that makes\nIt blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so\nIf you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks out some of the light as well\nIn addition to that uh we try to see gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet and so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so\nSometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late\nAnd so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also or something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them and\nThey insist on that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right why did they say out\nLoud so it's an extraordinary claim and is the famous thing goes extraordinary claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to rule out other possible expert\nHey ... you know and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they doubt\nWell so it's an extraordinary claim and is the famous thing goes next door now claiming is ah one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job or trying to\nRule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA good question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system uh that's that's pulling on this planet and making and walk around a those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations\nAnd uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible is not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nWell it was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about\nMeasure yeah yeah you know so we had to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitch together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that are that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point\nGoing to be hell why yeah if it had been spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a ... aware as humble orbit the earth\nOr when we performed this observation you know you can imagine ... staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James jaded just he won't have that problem and like I say the mirror is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these\nAnd are aware as Hubble orbits the earth\nOr when we performed this observation you know you can imagine Hubble staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James ... ... he won't have that problem\nAnd like I said the mirror is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly more of the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know their exams that I'm ...\nI'm not an obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think some law well we should have made it twice as big we've spent whatever yeah sure yeah you know\nOther telescopes coming down the pike ... their people bidding right now to well the we've talked about a W first and then there's a a telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah that's a uh I I don't know who's working on it that it's it's a ultraviolet and and I read an optical that's L.

Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use\nIt ... it is I'm All right so if this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nA great question and one of the things that I Am always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much\nSituation does it it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planets situation that's a great\nQuestion and one of the things that I Am always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems\nWe are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we ... is is the things going on here happened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here\nAnd that of course speaks directly to ah the question about the origin of life for example there\nAre so it's particularly since this moon is raising new questions about how you get something like this it's opening up some new questions about the dynamic will histories of these uh a planetary systems and and the speaks directly to that\nClub and the more exoplanets you discover with thousands of them yeah they are about four thousand confirmed plants I think at this point in the more questions you're going to open rather get answers fast\n\n\nFeaturing two events a candlelight vigil and a

we have this very twenty first idea scrawny first century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based kind of a but\nIn the nineteenth again at tended to be a kind of thin nasty a sauce with a lot of vegetable ways to end that people would put pumpkin runs people would put tomatoes but they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called our guys and then because of the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preserve it is and it like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... because of this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nDump preservatives it's in a like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this book capture because it's this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton

to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said that kept the

focus of your book in the poison squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that because what is the only one of the ... yet the main thing it's just crazy\nYou I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control but what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know\nVolunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever

safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things into human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a
