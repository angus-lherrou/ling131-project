after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved deep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you start a fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk a walk is the ideal shape for holding the oil knows flattering it's got the high side you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a it's a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring\nHome is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you start a fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk a walk the ideal shape for\nHolding the oil knows flattering it's got the high sides you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a it's a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I had my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay I add about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Chris go you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix and I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there\nI can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred and I am always adjusting to keep it around through twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk that's fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch All right good\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred\nAnd I'm always adjusting to keep it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk led fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch alright are good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender ISIS chicken it at some of that is sick flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another ... OK okay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the press pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for a different amount of time and if you only\nAnd then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's got a great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another track okay to go if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the best pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for a different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it now you got a little bit of money here and some lemon so I didn't do so you would yeah I don't I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken fried show yeah and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting of Israel is out this sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle and a kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken for ... oh yeah and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting has really brings out the sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle to kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end\nAnd was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSo I saw ginger little ketchup sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch and then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is\nMy version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSo I saw is ginger little catch upsetting to me and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important\nThis is double fried ooh so you fry it you cool it down and they try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy this\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger\nAnd I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and by the way I sent well and and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at high schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go and how it is fried chicken back in the day so there's a lot of history\nAnd I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and by the way off that well and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at past schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go in his fried chicken back in the day so there's a lot of history lots of history and David ... did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole\nEpisode on fried chicken and what the big takeaway is that it's eaten all over the world but I did talk to\nAnd you can watch a daily report from the b._b._c.

them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand

fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless

identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them\nUm it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognized\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying
