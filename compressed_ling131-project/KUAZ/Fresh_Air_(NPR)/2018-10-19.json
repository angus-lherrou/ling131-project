everybody you built tell you the honeybees get all the attention right now but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nMy did my PHD in a honeybee labs\nAnd but I went Robie's and worked on ... I started a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of really cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with them\nIf you ask every body you built tell you that honeybees good all the attention right and if you've gravitated to bumble ...\nActually did my PHD in a honeybee labs\nAre but I went rogue and worked on bumblebees instead I started when a PHD in two thousand six which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it was sequenced we suddenly had this tool kit that we could use to answer all kinds of really cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only bees bumblebees have a very different like psycho right out of the colonies gets started\nA first honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social um there's never a point in their lived in the life of a hybrid queen\nWhere she's living on her own bumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and these queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot and start their own nests so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens\nLeast social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and he's queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own and then in the spring I these queens half to crawl out of there over wintering spot\nAnd start their own nests so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have\nQueens and workers and this sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you weren't brought him to show us with ...\nI did yeah you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bomb will be used to actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these be groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\nAbout ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees was having\nAnd um sociology so we think that the ancestor to both of these groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor was social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\n... in the meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and swings my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused\nAnd the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forging how different individuals and economy contribute to forwarding ...\nYour broker maps with two ... Jarvis\nHarvester from I'm here in California would fail extra partially on the sidewalk since ... slightly larger than what we are a little bit longer there but yeah and there are ... and then once you see on the sidewalk and ... why are you interested in\nThese areas from the black or the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that\nTo forging paid roughly ... at home you're brought some ants were too jarring Jarvis harvest France from I'm here in California oh it's like stop I see on the sidewalk since ... slightly larger than what we are a little bit longer there but yeah and ... and the ones you see on the sidelines and what why are you interested in the\nCities area and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between ... so a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they call their friends to the food so another thing I brought here as a cast ... and flip it over I was on its head\nOh so it was like that that's a cast of a an ad Smith yes use that like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly faster players from Home Depot how far does that go down as just the whole length I Know that's just the top part\nAbout six eight inches long it looks just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is it's\nYou flip it over I was on its head\nOh so it was like that that's a cast of a an ad Smith yes use that like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly fast their players from Home Depot how far does that go down as just the whole length and now that says the top part\nAbout six eight inches long it looks just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is a type of metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when his hardens it's easier to dig around and break the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to sell and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how deep they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee is what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nThe drones said the ... the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and we've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage\nMuch focus on queen bumble bee is what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said that the Germans don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this or whether it was really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or food what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nFor the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other search trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're there\nIs that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point uh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are in honeybees ... and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your influenced or write or were there when the rights or just go ahead please\nOn my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to\nLike help or he'll her when she gets styles that is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack up for certain you work with food and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybees okay but not by movies um that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the ...\nIs allergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to\nLike help or he'll her when she gets styles that is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies um that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the\nTerrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were done by being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and the B interact\nInteresting ... course yeah great question are no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen how were their lives different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground ... and put their hives inside fame three cavities and so that's one difference for example\nIt'd be interact interesting ... requests yeah great question are no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen Howard their lives different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of ... and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities in some differences in first of all many of them live underground whereas bees will aim but their hives inside of fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example those honeybees in some species of ants will relocate from one site to another so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ants will also there's a species of frog dance that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places or there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have ... counties that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so the leaf cutter ... million individuals\nIn just in time for Halloween I Know that you also studies social spider ... social spider silks\nCertain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places or there's some similarities in some differences I think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have am colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... leaf cutter ... million individuals\nAnd just been talking for Halloween I Know that you also started his social spider borders social spider\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um and what happens is they are living in groups and the reason we think they leave in living these groups is so that they can capture

of trouble yeah\nBecause I get like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that's about\nAll that kind of ... in

questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what\nWe do know is that if you don't sleep adequately\nThat it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of

consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nI mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the quality what what one of the gene\nThat's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from uh\nA number of hours that quality what what one of the genes\nDoing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role and timing sleep\nOn the time of day you prefer to sleep time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day\nWhere sleep most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties of sleep the things about sleep that preserves your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains\nProperties of sleep the things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus and the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on now what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep\nOr not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study be on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which\nWe have ... so the mall one is what's known as a clot seen your clocks in every selling your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as a clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears\nTalk to my students about gives on the ... most of them don't know what collectors are [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nFor a long time we've been very interested in how these\nThe clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an endogenous timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gears on the clock most of them don't know the clock is er [laughter] so I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time\nThe majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your ... and the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks in the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas and the brain and tell your brain how to sleep more importantly how to recover from sleep loss\nAnd he wouldn't even have to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that's how the hit on the goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to\nPartly how to recover from sleep loss\nAnd when do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your thermostat side of the heat on if it goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep it will go into the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss\nAnd what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes that are as like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from now so when you say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock\nAre more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes that are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from you know so when you say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle\nSun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours question over here yeah I had a question about napping\nAs I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of in the south\nSo napping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself than an hour and I do have one of the great things about\nAnd it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours question over here you know I had a question about napping\nAs I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of in the cells\nSo napping is a is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself than that oh I Do have one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap in my office in the afternoon no one can complain you can write at all I mean I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is the mapping is very important if you're not getting daily stuff is asleep and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommend it but I think from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism\nI'm getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but everything from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much and that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism\nUm especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh so I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't\nBlame them either exactly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me or to let me go to the questions on this uh yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day\nBecause yes [laughter] and and as a parent\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep out ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day\nBecause yes [laughter] and and as a parent", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "19"}
