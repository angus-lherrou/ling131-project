you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four because you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously to set your character is not a bad guy where in real life cycle that guy anyway he's just he's a writer Agent Orange but in your life he he has said that the real writer has said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroyed him and they continue to do so um I don't think it's fair joined does it work for the Washington Post that writing articles for writing articles for the New York times he's huge illuminating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that falls in a long line of\nYou've obviously this is that your character is not a bad guy we're in real life at home a bad guy anyway\nHe's just he's a writer as an artist\nBut in your life he he has said that the real writer who said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroy them then they continue to do so um\nI don't think it's fair John does it work for the Washington Post who's not writing articles for writing articles for the New York times he's used eliminating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that follows it a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line and most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions and\nThere's a whole world effects to choose from the wrong facts getting the way of the story\nAnd your cat uh says the wrong facts what does that mean exactly what\nYou gotta be aware that we have a presidential spokes person Kellyanne Conway who spoke of alternative ...\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and frequently gets

where they were debating about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is kind of going oh come on clearly you are going to fall because you know the difference that math is you know Jim wants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it drew a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating certain point what do you think will start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense you'd do both ...\nIt is irritating and certain point what do you think will

representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures Tim\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven out of the Ninety nine the reason by the way that they are and I do notice because one state the Rascoe does not have both the house and Senate they only have one a chamber\nAt the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they're Ninety nine is because one state the brass guy does not have the house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why are Republicans so dominant at the same level\nWill will with a straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\nElections and four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and uh and and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to it\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct in in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so\nIt's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that and um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty\nConcern such good shape and the states is that they had a very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so\nIt's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that and um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty censuses right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nRight Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled\nAnd less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as\nThirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know that has a an

hundred legislative seats that will be filled in less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as thirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday\nAnd you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions and two thousand and Twenty one\nBut I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans on for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country\nSo they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is ... ... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party in the White House loses seats in state legislatures in ...\nThe six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is ... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats and legislators as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nUh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nPrinting into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures but um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\n[noise] uh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislator who are ... isn't it\nTV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races but you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislator who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do\nAnd um and then to your point it then it does sort of turn into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota in Colorado\nEr into something of a referendum on the parties and one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race or that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's all about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races in ...\nBut if it

where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle protected on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you now see\nFairly commonly in pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they've just increased fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago they are now paying a lot more attention\nTo the state races but both parties are going all in on these races you said President Obama said\nBut also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see
