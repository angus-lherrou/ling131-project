first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates there they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOf the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery in the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\nWell uh ... being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that sell live through the next generation continuing\nEvolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery in the cells of living organisms and when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here [noise]\nWell uh ... being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that sell live through the next generation\nAnd continuing with that particular new process inside is in ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this works significant\nWell the the ability to actually go into a simple cell as we might think of it\nAnd to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds like we do chemistry in a beaker flask\nWe control of fewer of ah the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we owe to mentally observe\nBut in all you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other ...\nAnd as we might think of it and to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds and if we do chemistry in a beaker flask\nWe control of fewer of uh the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we all Timothy observe\nBut you know you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so\nIt's a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker\nAnd ... the real breakthroughs here are to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire it outcome occur in the next generation as opposed to waiting for the slow evolutionary process as it is really what's so spectacular\nHere and now we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals are what are some of the real world applications of this\nWell to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but\nProcess as it is really what so spectacular here\nNow we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals what are some of the real world applications all this\nWell to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule is where the real creativity comes in\nSo imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells\nAnd have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex\nChemical reactions that do them in a very clean environment\nAnd so really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems that we could imagine making in chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these um these organisms that enable us to um take advantage of their natural process sees an exam\nOnly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex chemical reactions but do them in a very clean environment\nAnd so really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems we couldn't imagine making in the chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these um these organisms the naval us to ah\nTake advantage of their natural process sees an example I'm of a natural process are created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise in the war on generates um ethanol or alcohol and then the production of beer or wine\nOkay

fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on Donna strict Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work what does all of that mean for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] well I also point out that from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry or recognized as laureates in the same year\nUm and but you're absolutely right in the case of professor Arnold um she's the fifth woman and prior to that it was ... Hodgkin's and Nineteen sixty four that was recognized and then you start going way back to Marie Curie in Nineteen eleven\nThe point out that come from what I can tell this is the first time that

us in the American Chemical Society where where in some for me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical sciences specifically um for folks from all different backgrounds and and perspectives and for us recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\nPeter door out is president of the American

what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nBeen very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which\nIs a nearly doubled from the week prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago for say on friday or calls were a little more than doubled from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call you right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to a doctor for its testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nFive times as many calls as two weeks ago or say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call you right what are people saying we're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we\nHad a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to a doctor Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that the testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nWe had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault\nUm so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody in a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that yeah\nAbsolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment today and they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected\nHe might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment to they they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this you heard of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and our nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed\nYou know in other words this isn't about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it absolutely there\nTen Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words is it about sex did did people do people when they come for help it when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIs the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma\nOur brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we are going to fight we're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and was lousy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about it as well from the survivors that we work with\nWe usually people have a flashback she's also explained us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presence ing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain or neuro biased\nThe money is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing that as well from the survivors that we work with\nWhen you say people have a flashback she's also explain dust that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor replied and sing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talked to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience was\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way that trauma is stored in the brain to literally ... presents themselves and re experience that trauma\nIn an incredibly
