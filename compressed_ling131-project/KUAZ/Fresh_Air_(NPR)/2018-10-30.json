Cordray a lot of people know him because he used to run the consumer financial Protection Bureau he is also a five time jeopardy champion and the marshals scholar tell us about him\n[laughter] yeah you know he's kind of nerdy actually and he would say that he's describing himself that way actually but uh you know the thing with Cordray is he's he's very majored in what he says ah people here know him\nShe's in Columbus I Joe hello\nAnd let's talk about these candidates or Richard Cordray a lot of people know him because he used to run the consumer financial Protection Bureau he's also a five time jeopardy champion and the marshals scholar tell us about him\n[laughter] yeah you know he's kind of nerdy actually and he would say that he's describing himself that way actually\nBut uh you know the thing with Cordray is he's he's very majored in what he says uh people here know and he served as a state lawmaker he served as state treasurer he served as a G and then as you said he served in the federal level\nHe's been out of state for a while but now he's back running for governor\nOr and he is a coming in saying he wants to uphold the Affordable CARE Act he has a a comprehensive bond package a for road repair and infrastructure improvements so that's that's where he's running right now\nOkay and Mike DeWine is the current uh a G of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big guy\nHere and infrastructure improvements so that's that's where he's running right\nOkay and Mike DeWine is the current ah A. G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but a ... he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMight the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea of having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions\nBut he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nThen very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea of having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions\nBut he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAll right let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we are going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let ... it's my turn to an eight out ... and they get out it's my time you're going to get out ...\nOkay here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports said we had the highest increase in ... last year and he stayed in the nation All right so\nWhat we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is\nAnd they get out ... and they get out it's my on your program and I get out ...\n... and here's Cordray getting a word and we are the\nWorst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports said we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stays in the nation All right so\nWhat we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nSure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day\nOr because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it with you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but uh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here on uh how you\nAnd take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but uh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them is\nThat likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or order people what's on their minds\nWhat seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it what's the polling\nMike DeWine would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions\nThere trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it what's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind\nThat the most recent polling shows is that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNo uh governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal at Ohio\nIt is a big deal it's always a big deal but Ohioans habits\nThey were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal in Ohio\nAnd that is a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good opportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on it\nLet's join goes who

shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nMore than that something perhaps

about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like\nMore than that something perhaps\nTo do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but\nYou know if that played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil or back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nOr you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so are the very\nFrance flight for four

aircraft so a very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll slated flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane it had flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max aid is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the
