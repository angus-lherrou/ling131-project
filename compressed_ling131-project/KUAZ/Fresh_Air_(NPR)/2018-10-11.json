PCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jeremy and when you listen there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but they're well dressed but they're homeless\nYeah to me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know I'm demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness\nAnd when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain about street homelessness you know they associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now we're getting an example I you know\nWe really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know I'm demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness\nAnd when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse and a lot of the things that people complain about street homelessness you know the associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nWe're going to be an example you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county next to city hall in Santa Ana so you know people saw this every day when they walked past it on ... has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis sleeping in parks are asking for money on sidewalks and is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does whose salaries can't keep up with those market rate\nSidewalks and is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for every one let alone does whose salaries can't keep up with those market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nA there is historically been a lot of pushback against shelters and housing for homeless people and that continued today\nAnd there's a lawsuit in orange county uh currently before a federal judge in California toes briefly about that\nAnd our support comes from feast a restaurant with a menu that changes monthly face October menu and ...\nAnd support comes from feast a restaurant with a menu the changes monthly face October menu includes grilled sturgeon with praise celery root on rye flower Nikki as well as a chocolate chip bread pudding with hot chocolate and shaved sheep's milk cheese details are at the St menu dot com\nIn midtown right now Seventy nine degrees\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.
