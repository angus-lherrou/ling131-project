heard that in the film version these sharks and jets napping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because your own Robbins had trenches dug\nRight and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I'm championing of them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches\nYou can see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing of them in this book I Am not saying

the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I\nThink it will be fabulous well so how does this all start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the hundreds centennial a drone Robbins birth\nCertainly knew about his works as we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the Germans Nineteen Seventy one valley Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course the music from Bach let's just listen to them\n\nBirth certainly knew about his work says we all would know about west side story in in the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the Germans Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city

this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know we did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story fleet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece Eighteen minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nCourt lead friendly formal it was just an amazing race\nVariations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nQuarterly friendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had\nFeeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about\nThat that's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet\nPeter Pan man fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because he was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nDeborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crochet had panned and that she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes [noise]\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called Jerome Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court

toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking at him near as dancers sometimes do in a studio so that there's this weird feeling of we're spying on them anyway\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude towards things that had applied he was balancing loved dancers at a gathering which Robbins made and down she said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat at the whole thing endlessly\nPopcorn and that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but let me ask you a little\nAt a gathering this is ah the dance

but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's\nElaine get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November it means they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law in taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner um but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nUh the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request\nThe information in a confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request\nAnd to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house is not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le defended could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation to submit any of the information that its obtain too\nThe house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtain drew the full house or the full Senate and presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of reasons um could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years\nBroadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function\nOr the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I I think\nTax filing prior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father and there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns yeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about and we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances or the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress in the early Nineteen twenties uh there were a variety of reasons to principle one where they were carrying out\nAbout we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances or the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal\nInvolving some high level executive branch officials are the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the present it and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nOr there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior
