lot to do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press but to another think convinced me will personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to talk for begins to reason this up and\nActually twenty fifty and when to terrorists of al Qaida in Yemen arrive in the streets were the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in Paris\nAnd they into the building and they killed the Saudi up to a newsroom were sharing the same flaw that were the right to the door right next to her\n... my my life convinced me to talk for ... to reason deceptive and\nActually twenty Fifteen when to terrorists of I K die in Yemen arrive in the streets where the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in that race\nAnd they into the ... and they killed ... newsroom were sharing the same flaw that were the right to the door right next to her and these day address to arrive to date two minutes after the terrorist escape the building\nAnd I into the newsroom and then I I was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just totally dead\nAnd we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so this
