housing but where she's supposed to find housing\nThat's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers or that you can use to stay these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there\nReally there's about twenty that are accepting those vouchers and did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers but there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need

second homes are beach homes are not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are\nHomes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Mickey Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing up for work even though they have

nine thousand years\nWe've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing and we we got off awfully\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by a man devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologist Calvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's when some of the most important earliest fines were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a wheelbarrow of loan delivered to his home and he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this there is more than dirt is part of this ancient burial site yeah yeah\nThey had a delivery of Sirte and within the ... there were I\nEarliest ones were made Calvin Jones isn't he the one who got a wheelbarrow of loan delivered to his home and he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said\nWait a second this dirt is more than dirt as part of this ancient burial site you know here\nThey had a delivery a search and within the ... there were are\nThat is archaeologist Barbara clause of the\nFlorida public archaeology network and we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures\nIt's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of love meeting to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others okay we walked\nAcross that vast lawn and there it is I mean uh how how high near would you say this ...\nThis is the tallest of the southern mountains it is thirty six feet tall\nThese mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt and let's just backup what exactly is the mound this site is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions\n[noise] okay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say this ...\nThis is the tallest of the southern mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound this\nSite is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mount builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain a hut when that person past they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains and their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time it became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to\nKind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral\nOr is that it's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die\nOver time it became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pie or is that\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today to definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climb the stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nOr their native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who live to use the descendants of the people\nWho live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we are not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up the mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know\nPeople who lived here studs descendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we are not climbing the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know this concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking\nSince the year one thousand a de these mouths and we're right on top now these mounts have weathered uh when did a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the mound and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are we're at the top\nOf the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community would get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have leaked\n'cause they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the mountain and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on top\nOf the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community we'd get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have Lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to this throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at Jackson\nThey were finding copper brass plates or ... ... it's we don't have proper in Florida so it was evidence of trade with those other places", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "25"}
