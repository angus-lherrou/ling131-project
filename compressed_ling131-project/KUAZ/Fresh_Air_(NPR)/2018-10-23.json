bike and scooters combined and how long have they been around\nWe launched a pilot program about a year ago or to allow these companies to demonstrate the technology here in Washington DC about a year ago and have people been happy with them so far are what are they saying\nWell we've gotten a lot of feedback about their use and certainly there are several people who have a really be begun to use these as a part of their ah daily commuting experience and others who are using them or for periodic trips to go a long distance or how how far are they going to commute the scooter\nWhat we've seen a

about their use and certainly there are several people who have a really be be gone to use these as a part of their daily commuting experience and others who are using them for a periodic trips\nTo go a long distance or how how far are they going to commute with a scooter\nWhat we've seen a different types of trips in some cases they are short distances in some cases they are a longer connection a distance is getting to and from metro stations for example so there are a number of use cases that we have observed a over the past year and\nOne of the things that a lot of cities have said about these scooters one of the problems that they've seen is that people just leave them on the sidewalks and the clog up the sidewalks and then if you're disabled and you're trying to use your wheelchair and get down the sidewalk you could get stuck because there's there are a bunch of scooters in front are you seeing that there\nThis is something that we heard very early on during the demonstration period and it's something that we took very seriously in working with\nThe companies to ensure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use of were reflective of those things and that has become something that we're we're working very closely to to\nChair and get down the sidewalk you could get stuck because there's there are a bunch of scooters in front of using that they're\n[noise] this is something that we heard very early on during the demonstration period and it's something that we took very seriously in working with\nThe companies to ensure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use a were reflective of those things and that has become something that we're we're working very closely to to enforce and and we see the incidents of those things are decreasing\nAnd do you have a good relationship with the companies are you in contact with them regularly\nA we have ah been working with them to collect data and information and also to report problems that we hear from from members of the public here in Washington DC uh and so we have a opened a line of communication with them to ensure that we're sharing information at and that they're sharing information with us\nAnd they are sharing information with you that is correct\nSo obviously one of the big concerns is safety and I'm just last month there was an SUV that hit and killed a man who was riding a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time that somebody has died in an accident in the U.S on on one of these scooters what do you know about that are working\nInto line of communication with them to ensure that we're sharing information at and that they're

man who is writing a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time that somebody has died in an accident in the U.S on on one of these scooters\nWhat do you know about that or what can you tell us about that and and how you're making sure that that doesn't happen again it leads to the extent that you can try to stop it from happening again\nWell D.C is a city that is committed to vision zero which is a a a strategy that under the leadership of our mayor we've put in place to eliminate roadway fatalities in serious injuries and we're doing everything that we can taking it very seriously to work with\nThe technology companies that are here to ensure that that their rules and regulations are are are followed by their users we're also taking a number of steps to ensure that we're building the safest possible infrastructure\nUh it's worth noting that all forms of transportation come with inherent risks and so we're working with in this case with these companies specifically a two to ensure that they are promoting the safest possible a use for\nWe can taking it very seriously to work with\nUh the technology companies that are here to ensure that that their rules and regulations are are are followed by their users we're also taking a number of steps to ensure that we're building the safest possible infrastructure [noise]\nAh it's worth noting that all forms of transportation come with inherent risks and so we're working with in this case with these companies specifically to to ensure that they are promoting the safest possible a use for their users and that we are\nA informing the public about uh about this new form of technology this new form of mobility that is on the road\nWith one of the things that people have said about the the safety risk of these scooters is that a lot of the people who ride them not just in Washington but all over the country are wearing helmets and and that they're they're out on the roads with cars but they're not wearing helmets or do they have to wear helmets in D.C currently the\nLaw and DC are for helmets is is limited to individuals who are sixteen or under a some of the companies as you may know do a giveaway helmets and they strongly incentivize riders to use helmets and and that's something that that I think companies are are thinking about as a as this technology moves forward\nWhat about a a government or what about the district of Columbia are are you thinking or are people in D.C thinking\nIt's a do they have to wear helmets in D.C\nCurrently the law and DC are for helmets is is limited to individuals who are sixteen or under or some of the companies as you may know do a giveaway helmets and they strongly incentivize or riders to use helmets or and and that's something that that I think companies are are thinking about as a as this technology moves forward\nAnd what about a a government or what about the district of Columbia are are you thinking or are people in D.C thinking about putting in a law that says that people have to wear helmets if they're writing these rented scooters [noise]\nYou know I Can't speak to what lawmakers may or may not do with respect to changing the the current helmet law certainly we are always encouraging both cyclists and people who are using scooters or to to be as safe as possible and that that includes wearing a helmet\nSo you get to see the data as you said what are you finding about how this is changing transportation in DC is it having a big effect\n[noise] it's it's very early to tell what what the impacts will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling and to to trips taken that's really why we have decided to do this in an incremental approach to allow uh kept a number of these vehicles on the street\nYou get to see the data as you said what are you finding about how this is changing transportation in DC is it having a big effect [noise] it's it's very\nEarly to tell what what the impact will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling and to to trips taken that's really why we have decided to do this\nIn an incremental approach to allow uh kept a number of these vehicles on the street to observe their use patterns but also to to really dive deep into the data to to get a better understanding of of how the public is interacting with them\nAnd right now the cap number is what the cat numbers four hundred per company okay and so now we're talking about what the addition of lift a currently in a district there there are five companies five companies\nJeff you've been in Washington now for a number of years how big is the addition of electric scooters doc lists rent a bull electric scooters compared to any other changes that you've seen in transportation including by the way over and left over the years\nI Am glad that you mentioned uber and Lyft because there was a time when that technology first emerged and came into the market uh that that people were asking a lot of the same types of questions that we are now asking about a duck\nA number of years how big is the addition of electric scooters doc less rent a bull electric scooters compared to any other

came into the market uh that that people were asking\nA lot of the same types of questions that we are now asking about a duck with bikes and scooters this is a significant change it's one that provides a new mobility opportunity and\nUnder the leadership of our mayor Muriel Bowser it's something that we have a embrace but have done so in a very incremental way to ensure that are that the technology is utilized a in a safe way for the residents and visitors of the district of Columbia\nThere are still a lot of cities in this country that do not allow the scooters and I'm In one of them right now what would your advice be to other cities that are considering whether to allow ... uh electric rentals scooters on the roads\nAdvice is really to to listen to the public we very

bill gates or the Thomas Watson junior who made things the software and hardware but somebody needed to chronicle what was going on and that was his mission so he created computer world magazine

years running the company but yes the first publication was computer world\nWhich became the Bible of the information technology industry what was in it what what would you find in computer well it was it was news weekly news it was product reviews and things like that but mostly it was\nTaking a look at the people and players in the industry the companies that were moving and shaking um they

he talking to with computer world and Mac world\nWell computer early Mac world would be slightly different audiences Mac world was really aimed right away at the apple marketing backing it started on the day they release the Macintosh computer and like ... or investors or who this would have been the computer world was aimed early on at data processing managers deep ... managers who morphed into\nWhat we now think of is ... chief information officer is\nIt wouldn't that there were no terminals\nI'm set up like Bloomberg this was strictly a newspaper\nToday obviously it's strictly on line but you know over the course of those three or four decades computer world was a print publication and it was aimed at at offering technology people an insight into what the products were who is

lots of visionaries lots of entrepreneurs out there who've done great things but had had a very unique style of management and leadership which is what the book is about that he saw the world
