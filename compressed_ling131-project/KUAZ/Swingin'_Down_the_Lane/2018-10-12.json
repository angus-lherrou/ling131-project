feller Chapman\nWhen we were writing thinking about women and migration and gender and enough itself it's such a vast thing to consider with many many definitions in a multitude of experiences\nAnd a poet said I'm working with in our piece follow along the gender spectrum in different ways and so part of our work was to think about that\nHow can we expand through our work what people might stereotypical you think of when they hear female migrations\nThink when I think if FEMA migrations I think of like the idea of like movement\nThing to consider with many many definitions in a multitude of experiences and a poet said I'm working within our piece follow along the gender spectrum in different ways and so part of our work was to think about that\nHow can we expand through our work what people might stereotypical a think of when they hear female migrations\nI think like when I think a female migrations I think of like the idea of like movement and not just like in the idea of moving on my place to place but also like the movement within an identity um specifically like gender identity\nCan you share with us any questions that you began to ask yourself as you begin to approach presenting art for this event\nThe first question I asked myself especially like um\nWith I guess like where I'm personally at um is like should I be there and I'm like looking at like the\nAdvertisement and stuff like questioning like well what does that mean for me but then at the same time also claiming I'm like this long period of time right did identify strictly a female um and understand you that that's also not necessarily the entire conversation but there is a fragment are particle and the conversation for that space to\nTrade was saying there so many ways in which we

time also claiming I'm like this long period of time right did identify strictly a female um and understand you that that's also not necessarily the entire conversation but there is a fragment article in the conversation for that space to\nLike trade was saying there so many ways in which we migrate across\nThoughts in identities I think for me it's about migrating\nAround I guess ideas and and how we have to deal with them because these inequities have been around for a very long time um but the ways in which we heal and find ways of healing and then deal with them look very different so I think for this one it's another form of\nMigrating across healing spaces because sometimes we get shifted over into being defensive and having to protect ourselves it's hard to make space for healing but the process to me is almost\nAs important if not more important than the actual performance and so being in that process of creating space to write with five other folks about these topics has been very healing for us\nTo re we are the ... period for identity politics gender race have you had\nSometimes we get shifted over into being defensive and having to protect ourselves it's hard to make space for healing but the process to me is almost as important if not more important than the actual performance and so being in that process of creating space to write with five other folks

children in pediatric oncology\nShe showed me a few of the more than two hundred paintings that will be on display\nSo it today that we work with children ages three and a half to twenty nine so you'll see pieces of artwork from all those different age ranges\nAmazing and right now we're looking at a piece of our young girl five years old her brother died and here's a piece of art she produced that's a kind of ironically called happy can you describe it for our listeners\nWhat struck me about this piece is like you said the title is called happy yet we're looking at a girl on the piece of canvas that has a sad face with brown hair\nBright colors on her shirt but for some reason this child chose to title her piece of artwork as happy\nAlmost a stick figure but there's there's\nThat's a kind of ironically called happy can you describe it for our listeners\nWhat struck me about this piece is like you said the title is called happy yet we're looking at a girl on the piece of can best that has a sad face with brown hair\nBright colors on her shirt but for some reason this child chose to title her piece of artwork as happy\nAs almost a stick figure but there's there's also depth and detail to the body it's obviously something that she's been a lot of time thinking about and the minimal is among the limbs is almost a statement almost part of the design in terms of drawing your eyes towards the face of the figure and as you say there is a big ... their\nTheir question when they were in group was just if you could show somebody what grief looks like in your life what would you show them and\nThey were given some time to think about it and so there were no limits it wasn't you have to drop her thing you have to draw your special person you have to paint a landscape it was just this is what this child that I Want to draw this person with a sad face\nAnd this could almost maybe be looked kind of like an alter ego for the little girl of a vision of what she feels like insider\nShow somebody what grief looks like in your life what would you show them and\nThey were given some time to think about it and so there were no limits it wasn't you have to drop her thing you have to draw your special person you have to paint a landscape it was just this is what this child that I Want to draw this person with a sad face\nOn this could almost maybe be looked kind of like an alter ego for the little girl of a vision of what she feels like inside her how she views herself\nIt'll depend on how you want to look at the painting is this the self portrait of what she feels on the inside but doesn't project that out for others to see and it comes out on paper now and she's given that time to process and put paint brush to paper\nUm you just don't know and especially with this age group it's just amazing to see what this young of an age group has produced\nA thinker brush worth is really expressive [noise]\nOur next age group includes a painting here by an eleven year old girl whose mother died because of an accident and the painting is called hidden face it's acrylic oil pain but it's been manipulated she she sponges to do the background\nBut her attention to form and figure on the face of her subject is very detailed and very mature I Would say\nJust think there's so many layers\nThe young of an age group has produced\nA thinker brush workers really expressive [noise]\nOur next age group includes a painting here by an eleven year old girl whose mother died because of an accident\nAnd the painting is called hidden face it's acrylic oil pain but it's been manipulated she she sponges to do the background but her attention to form and figure on the face of her subject is very detailed and very mature I Would say\nI just think there's so many layers in this piece of artwork so the background is a bunch of colors muddle together with sponge work um to really put the face of the picture in the foreground the artwork and to make it what you're drawn to when you first look at it\nUm the title is called hidden face and it's just interesting because there is nothing hiding in her face to face as what you see but it's got like a patch of red on her cheek so you will not put out if it's a wound if it's a\nScar but that's also the lip color and one eye as open in one eye is closed so I just think there's so many messages being sent in this piece of artwork\nThere's so much beautiful our work here is so hard to focus on a piece but one that really cost\nIt's just interesting because there's nothing hiding in her face to face as what you see but it's got like a patch of red on her cheek so you will not put out if it's a wound that fits\nA scar but that's also the lip color and when I as open in one eye is closed so I just think there's so many messages being sent in this piece of artwork\nAmanda there's so much beautiful are were curious so hard to focus on a piece but one that really calls out to me is this one from an artist who is Eighteen years old I'm her brother has been diagnosed with leukemia\nAnd she's produced a painting called depression with hope and their dark mountains in the foreground and a multi colored blue sky in the background and just the mere as tens of light\nComing up over those mountains\nI feel like this is a really deeply thoughtful work what would you want to say about depression with hope\nThe color choice allow and just how it lands in the darkness then all of a sudden like you said it kinda brings in that little bit of light peeking through um [noise] I think the title as powerful enough itself depression with hope\nUm and like you said done by an Eighteen year old girl whose brother is currently going through the treatment for leukemia and just what she\nDeeply thoughtful work what would you want to say about depression with hope\nThe color choice allow and just how it blends in the darkness than all of a sudden like you said it kinda brings in that little bit of light picking through um think the title is powerful enough itself depression with hope\nUm and like you said done by an Eighteen year old girl whose brother is currently going through the treatment for leukemia and just what she must feel like as the sibling going through this process alongside her brother\nSo from our older age group we have a woman who's twenty four her brother died of a fatal asthma attack and anyone living with asthma like myself feels the peril in that [noise] um but tell us what she did in terms of using text and her painting\nWhat's really powerful about this piece of work is the title combined with the tax on the artwork so the title is grief sometimes makes you lose people who aren't dead and in the picture you see black and gold ... and the fact\nWith it'll be okay I'm Sorry for your loss what's wrong with you by so she's talking about all the people that abandon\nAbout this piece of work is the title combined with the tax on the artwork so the title is grief sometimes makes you lose people who aren't dead and then the picture you see black and gold ... and the fact\nWith it'll be okay I'm Sorry for your loss what's wrong with you\nBy so she's talking about all the people that abandoned her and her grief that left that couldn't handle it felt awkward around her\nAnd so she lost her friends some of her friends weren't as supportive as they thought they were being and I think that this piece of artwork as really powerful about the stigma of grief we don't know what to say and so sometimes we can say the wrong thing or not be helpful when we're trying to be helpful\nAnother phrase that she wrote down here is this is too much for me to deal with I'm tired of this\nIs a good reminder of just how resilient kids are um and how sometimes it's the adults own anxiety or the adults get in the way up the process and really giving the kids this freedom and not having limits on them and what they could put down on paper and just seen I mean the artwork\nPhrase that she wrote down here is this is too much for me to deal with I'm tired of this\nI think this is a good reminder of just how resilient kids are um and how

oh honey you're never made\nUm yeah even you know this is our our technically are twenty seven professional year as a group\nAnd I I still work as if this could all end tomorrow that's why people ask like well you do so many things you have a Nineteen jobs like when did you get to relax and you just don't in my mind that it's always this could end tomorrow so don't ever sleep\nYou know it does it ever surprise you that you have become that guy now to people turn to for advice and mentorship and\nI'm I'm very uncomfortable with that even my Twitter handles says like I'm I'm Better as a student not a teacher like this whole course love is said scholar at ... right you're bunch of rappers called me like oh gee\n[laughter] no I I I kind of shrug it that ... would you be here without the

actually like good actually what I Want I Want to be underestimated 'cause I Want it to\nI Want it to to kill all a perceptions of this being a square gig yeah do do you buy the sort of the the conventional wisdom that you've changed late music [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media\nHad just started to become a thing or something like ... the idea of viral videos was becoming a thing and we took advantage of it like we were really young kids\nSort of the the conventional wisdom that you've changed late that music\n[noise] um [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media\nHad just started to become a thing something like ... the idea of viral videos was becoming a thing and we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block\nAnd it was clear like Letterman wasn't going to start being on Snapchat and that sort of thing so we just took advantage of and then the playing field you know a lot of late night shows were just post jazz music\nThere there were other\nAvenues to explore and we took full advantage of it it it's interesting because there was a lineage right there's doc severance and from the old Tonight Show and then there's Paul Shaffer probably the next notable down in an interview\nAnd the roots that's weird and you know again like I didn't you know I didn't have posters of ... said or am I Want to like one day that'll be me it's just making the most of it again like in two thousand eight when he proposed it to us or\nWe should say you you didn't take the call for a long time yeah I was like a man we just got to to a place where we are making good money on the road\nThe old Tonight Show and then there's Paul Shaffer probably the next notable guy and and the others you\nAnd the

eight when he proposed it to us or\nI should say you you didn't take the call for a long time yeah I was like a man we just got to to a place where we are making good money on the road like why will return\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably or was that our domestic personal lives huh kids were getting older crime or at the airport\nSo it was sort of like we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there's a way that we could Celine Dion our way\nInto a position that I use
