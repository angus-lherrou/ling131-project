traveled the country to document the stories and messages of hope from other survivors and to take rebutting portraits that celebrate their diverse identities\nIn many ways deserve ... project is what the S. word is all about as Lisa Klein is quick to acknowledge\nI went into it from a place of law and what I found\nAs I was researching this was sort of this this rising group of people who had said to aside and survive\nSo early in my research I came across what that is right with the way and immediately I got in touch with her and we met and we were talking about what we're doing and it wasn't until probably\nA year in or so um where we thought you know what we're going to use it as a framing divided I mean I was talking to people who had lost people to suicide I was talking about to

and we met and we were talking about what we're doing and it wasn't until probably\nA year in or so um where we thought you know what we're going to use this as a framing device I mean I was talking to people who had lost people to suicide I was talking about to attempt survivors then I realized that she also with talking to a kind of survivors and taking these amazing photos and we knew that we wanted her to be part of the film\nLisa for people who haven't seen them how would you describe what it's like to look at a gallery of does raise photographs\nWow that is a great question is the first time I've ever been asked that question\nI think when you go and you're looking not only are you looking\nThere are also they have headphones so you can listen to the story and for for many people it could be the first time that they're actually looking at these photographs they're looking at me and they're talking to me and it is it's up to me\nTo look back and to absorb and to listen to really listen to what's going on with them and I think a bad experience is\nHumanizing and that's exactly again another parallel\nSo you can listen to the story and for for many people it could be the first time that they're actually looking at these photographs they're looking at me and they're talking to me and it is it's up to me\nTo look back and to absorb and to listen to really listen to what's going on with them and I think that experience is\nHumanizing and that exactly again another parallel with film because you know it's one thing we heard the statistics that suicide but\nTo see the faces into the the people who had been on that edge and are here to tell their story we're putting a human face on it\nOne thing that seems to be very common among the people that are featured in the film news that they had a trauma when they were younger that made them look at life differently\nAfter your own experience in life with your brother and then doing the film do you find common ground among these people that you weren't aware of before\nIt really isn't just about mental illness when you're talking about something like suicide and you picked up on that with with trauma it's a building block how was the trauma that dealt with because it's one thing to have the trauma that and what are your coping skills and when you're really\nThat made them look at life differently after your own experience in life with your brother and then doing the film do you find common ground among these people that you weren't aware of before\nIt really isn't just about mental illness when you're talking about something like suicide and you picked up on that with with trauma\nIt's a building block how is the trauma dealt with because it's one thing to have the trauma then what are your coping skills than when you're really young you're coping skills are not very well developed yet\nBut I think it's finding that connection so for me both my father and my brother died by suicide when I was in college and being able to talk about it was not a skill that I had then and I think that that is common because\nWhen somebody decide could tell their story you know they're building a community they're building a trust all of that but it isn't always easy because if the person who they're talking to if there's a lot of judgment and balled and I'm also we tend to\nWant to fix whatever it is so if you're telling somebody\nFor example about your depression how you feel and they say you know what if you run three times a week and you do yoga in retail and you\nDecide could tell their story you know they're building a community they're building a truck to all of that but it isn't always easy because if the person who they're talking to if there's a lot of judgment involved and I'm also we tend to\nWant to fix whatever it is so if you're telling somebody\nFor example about your depression how you feel and they say you know what if you run three times a week and you do yoga any retail and you're Eighteen law you're going to feel so much better because everybody knows better than you write so I think that that is a huge part of it too I think that\nSometimes you can get beaten down if you start to talk then you don't know what you're being that way so it's really coming up with your own coping skills like what works for you\n[noise] something that's accurate right now in our national conversation about surviving trauma that's in the film is wind Craig's dad asks him why didn't you talk about it you know as if everyone thinks that in the moment of crisis\nWe can communicate and that's not always an option that's on the table maybe use later like in the instance of Greg his father who was seemed to forge a very strong relationship but at one point Craig was\nThat could right now in our national conversation about surviving trauma that's in the film is wind Craig's dad asks him why didn't you talk about it you know as if everyone thinks that in the moment of crisis\nWe can communicate and that's not always an option that's on the table maybe use later like in the instance of Greg and his father who was seemed to forge a very strong relationship but at one point Craig was boy he was on the edge for a long time\nAnd fickle process things differently and you're right it does paralleled the national conversation right now it's like I that's a politicized adapted is they are why wait thirty six years old because it's so easy to have the conversation is not as we know and when you're talking about fighting for your life\nIt's up to each individual person to figure out what is going to make it\nOkay and community that that does raise warming with it you know these people and she has like a Facebook page where they communicate with each other to have people who really understand is one very important part of it and another I think really important thing is to try to get people\nBefore they get to that edge and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow well Lisa Klein she wants to start talking to kids at five years old about suicide that's radical but there are people in your film who thought about suicide when they were five years old\nThat was already there that was already a part of their world view\nAbsolutely and it isn't just about suicide it's it's it's really it's a it's a lot bigger than that it's about ... it's about inclusion it's about community so when we're talking about five and six year old it is it like hey are you thinking about suicide it is that like\nHey who you want to like you know I mean there there's a teacher who's doing that who who are they taught that the kids should teach at third grade this is one example I Hope they're teachers but every teacher's doing this which they're not but [noise]\nUm and and and really just opening the conversation to are they being included and how are they feeling at all that but being afraid to say hey are you thinking about suicide when when you suspect that somebody is we need to have that conversation\nAnd one of the really tough questions that does re asks her subjects that people she meets and photographs who were suicide survivors is she asked them in a very casual way is is still on the table for you is this still an option and its\nAre they being included and how are they feeling at all that but being afraid to say hey are you thinking about suicide when when you suspect that somebody is we need to have that conversation\nAnd one of the really tough questions that does re asks her subjects that people she meets and photographs who were suicide survivors\nIs she asked them in a very casual way is is still on the table for you is this still an option and it's tough and there's there's one woman in the film who answers know since I became a mother this is off the table this is not something I think about any more\nBut not everybody can say that as you as you said you know it's it's a different than outlook in a different perspective that can last a person's lifetime but it doesn't mean they have to make the ultimate decision\nAbsolutely and collect she in the film says it does\nI don't want to be thinking about it anymore but that wouldn't be ...\nI Do think about it uh one of our our last interview the other um she was in a really bad place and she said to me if I were at that place right now I might not be here but my coping skills has changed I talk to my mother now I taught my friends they know\nWhen to get in touch with like it's a whole different thing she's not hiding it anymore but does she still\nShe in the film says it does\nI don't want to be thinking about it anymore but that wouldn't be on it I Do think about it or one of our our last interview the other um she was in a really bad place and she said to me if I were at that place right now I might not\nBe here but my coping skills has changed I talk to my mother now I talked to my friends they know when to get in touch with like it's a whole different thing she's not hiding it anymore but does she still think about it\nYeah because you can't help somebody how to think or how to feel just like you know we we we probably all been guilty of like what if somebody says that they're feeling depressed or they're feeling suicidal no no you're not you're okay you're fine non buck up ... no I think it's okay to say All right\n\n\n\n\nMost males sitcoms set in a workplace where like and then after that you get to programs like sex and the city in girls and they're all about the female relationships with one another while men come and go and drive them crazy\nYou also coined what was to me a new phrase and as with split terms\nYeah I Know I couldn't come up with anything else but it's sort of like there are workplace sitcoms where you spend your whole time like at the bar of cheers or their situation comedies where their their family sitcoms where you spend all the time at home like leave it to beaver\nBut what about the ones that go half and half and I finally decided a let's call those split comes\nAnd for our audience are in the split comes category David being who chooses the Andy Griffith show the Dick Van Dyke show the Bob Newhart show than Seinfeld and Louis\nI think Seinfeld is an interesting choice because as a casual watcher not a lover of Seinfeld which has gotten me into many arguments I'm not ... cocktail parties um that\nI did not because of not liking Seinfeld ... well I'm sure no go ahead [laughter]\nFor our audience are in the split comes category David being Cooley chooses the Andy Griffith show the Dick Van Dyke show the Bob Newhart show than Seinfeld and Louis\nI think Seinfeld is an interesting choice because as a casual watcher not a lover of Seinfeld which has gotten me into many arguments I'm not fun to cocktail parties\nUm that I did not because of not liking Seinfeld ... well I'm sure no go ahead [laughter] um I didn't think of Seinfeld is being a sitcom where the workplace environment was really all that important\nBut then again Jerry Seinfeld played a standup comedian on the show and you could say that the times when he's standing in front of the brick wall doing his routines is actually a workplace element of that show\nAnd in the early seasons that was a key structure of that because a lot of Seinfeld in the early years dealt with showing his private life as it built and related to uh the jokes that he would tell when he was at\nWork the first stage in the split calm evolutionary chain that you present is the Andy Griffith show which is very sly in a way because the workplace elements and Andy's famine\nWas a key structure of that because a lot of Seinfeld in the early years dealt with showing his private life as it built and related to um the jokes that he would tell when he was at\nWork the first stage in the split calm evolutionary chain that you present is the Andy Griffith show which is very sly in a way because\nThe workplace elements and Andy's family live we're so blended together it's really hard in that case to tell where one ends and the other begins\nA great observation and ... and it's true it's so gentle and the members of his family came in and out of you know his sheriff's office all the time anyway I think Opie was at his dad's workplace as much as dad was home\nBut uh it was a beautiful melding of the two and just like with the Dick Van Dyke show when the character came home from the TV show he had a full interesting life\nUh with you know Rob ... wife Laura but when he went to work he had an equally interesting life\nAre relating to his boss and trying to come up with comedy and dealing\nHe's as much as dad was home\nBut uh it was a beautiful melding of the two and just like with the Dick Van Dyke show when the character came home from the TV show he had a full interesting life\nUh with you know Rob ... wife Laura but when he went to work he had an equally interesting life\nAre relating to his boss and trying to come up with comedy and dealing with the other comedy writers so that was to sitcoms in one um and I I think that's because Carl Reiner who created the show with not only writing what he knew\nBut he was in New TV writer other than your show of shows which was sketch stuff so in writing his first sitcom\nHe didn't know that he was breaking rules by making it that complicated\nTell me about interview and Carl Reiner for the book there's so many great performers and writers that you interviewed Carl Reiner is such an important guy when we talk about TV evolution\nYou know there's two parts of the book there's my silly let's play Darwin kind of evolutionary TV stuff where I'm a critic and and the writer and that's part of it the other part was to go through all of TV history and say who are the people whose work him\nTell me about interviewing Carl Reiner for the book there's so many great performers and writers that you interviewed Carl Reiner is such an important guy when we talk about TV evolution\nYou know there's two parts of the book there's my silly let's play Darwin kind of evolutionary TV stuff\nWhere I'm a critic and and the writer and that's part of it the other part was to go through all of TV history and say who are the people whose work impressed me the most influence TV the most and are still alive for me to talk to and for the entire history of TV\nUh I I spoke to about thirty on that's my favorite part of the book and in the earliest part you get Carl Reiner you get Mel Brooks you get Norman leader\nOr people that were there when television began and it was just great because all three of those men have a ... downed English sharp memories\nFor their age for any age I don't remember what they remember in terms of the years that we were both on the planet so it's pretty amazing an interesting\nCategory as crime shows because there are five stages of evolution start with hill street blues certainly not the first Graham show on TV\nDan and it was just great because all three of those men have a ... downed English sharp memories for their age for any age I don't remember what they remember in terms of the years that we were both on the planet so it's pretty amazing\nAn interesting category as crime shows because there are five stages of evolution\nStart with hill street blues certainly not the first grand show on TV but a major um a major reassessment in a major reimagining of what a cop show could be and from hill street blues you go to NYPD Blue than we have the Sopranos not as much about cops as you might need but definitely a crime show\nThan the shield and didn't Breaking Bad and that's the one that really surprised me because I think I Would have expected a show like the wire or something not Breaking Bad which once again wasn't really about cops it was truly about crime\nRight and I do I do write and briefly about the wire and I loved the wire but that evolutionary spot a with crime it begins with hill street blues because all of crime shows on TV or either before or after hill street blues hill street is the one that brought this\nI Would have expected a show like the wire or something not Breaking Bad which once again wasn't really about cops it was truly about crime\nAnd I do I do write and briefly about the wire and I loved the wire but that evolutionary spot a with crime it begins with hill street blues because all of crime shows on TV or either before or after hill street blues hill street is the one\nThat brought the serialized soap opera approach to it and kill people off suddenly regularly and and showed its heroes\nAs something less than always her away\nAnd so from there you go to NYPD Blue were you when you start with a very flawed\nProtagonist in in ... and he ends up\nBeing a better more noble character by the end and then by the Sopranos you're not paying attention to the to the order side of you know law and order you're you're looking at the criminals and then the shield you have a cop who basically is a criminal\nAnd in Breaking Bad it's an evolution in itself from a character who begins law abiding and ends up being a ruthless\nBeing a better more noble character by the end and then by the Sopranos you're not paying attention to go to the order side of you know law and order you're you're looking at the criminals and then the shield you have a cop who basically is a criminal\nAnd in Breaking Bad it's an evolution in itself from a character who begins law abiding and ends up being a ruthless bad guy\nPart of that evolution is the acceptance of having a protection is too is less than noble and it just\nKeeps on accelerating in each one of those examples\nOK so a couple of more I Want to hit real fast before we run out so\nSoap operas is a really interesting one to David because here you include a show that I Would not think of as a soap opera we think of it as a soap opera satire\nAnd that's Mary Hartman Mary Hartman but here it is number two sandwiched in between Peyton place in Dallas in the evolution of night time soap operas well understood soap operas perfectly and ah the appeal that Mary Hartman Mary Hartman had is the exact same appeal\nThat daytime soaps like General Hospital and one life to live would have and which paid in place\nOf as a soap opera we think of it as a soap opera satire and that's Mary Hartman Mary Hartman\nBut here it is number two sandwiched in between Peyton place in Dallas in the evolution of night time soap operas\nWell eight understood soap operas perfectly and ah the appeal that Mary Hartman Mary Hartman had is the exact same appeal\nThat daytime soaps like General Hospital and one life to live would have\nAnd which Peyton place in Dallas tapped into\nYou know it had villains that had heroes that continuing stories it at sudden deaths that had outrageous romances you know uh it really knew what it was doing and eat appeal to
