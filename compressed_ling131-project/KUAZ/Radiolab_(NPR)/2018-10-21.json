do it in ... somebody's front porch [laughter] I Want to bet that person first [laughter] yeah that I I don't care about the conversation [laughter] die at\nAll right in other wacky news I Want us to talk about a story in academia\nAnd the strange fight happening in that world over the last year or so\nThese really crazy studies have started to show up in some peer reviewed journals one was a study about rape culture at Portland dog parks among dogs another study argued that professional bodybuilding is bigoted because it doesn't include a category for quote fat body building\nAnd then another study replaced anti Semitic phrases in Hitler's mind Tom ...\nWith feminist buzzwords yeah so all these studies are part of a big hoax fake studies placed in real journals to show that a certain type of scholarship is corrupting academic research\nThese posters call it grievance studies the associated with fields that are focused on identity like gender studies are clear studies are critical race theory\nIn another study replaced anti Semitic phrases in Hitler's mind Tom ...\nWith him and his passwords yeah so all these studies are part of a big hoax fake studies placed in real journals to show that a certain type of scholarship is corrupting academic research\nThese ... call it grievance studies they associated with fields that are focused on identity like gender studies are clear studies are critical race theory\nI had to get to the bottom of this so I called up one of the three ... hello Jens Lindsey hello he's a mathematician\nMy backgrounds in what's called ... which sounds nobody's [laughter] sounds hard it's it's basically solving\nPuzzles and I had a lot of questions for him but first I had to understand what he means by the phrase grievance studies\nStudies is this is a little bit of a complicated term because people think we're talking about particular fields or subjects and that's not correct\nGrievance studies is something that double method that is an approach to studying certain things to be really really Christ was it the actual definition would be the definition for what is formerly known as critical constructive ism which is this idea that\nSociety is built out of power dynamics\nGrievance studies\nStudies is this is a little bit of a complicated terms because people think we're talking about particular fields or subjects and that's not correct\nGrievance studies is something it up a method that is an approach to studying certain things to be really really Chris for the the actual definition would be the definition for what is formerly known as critical constructive ism which is this idea that\nSociety is built out of power dynamics that are regulated in language\nAnd so this study's come from a position of not just say social marginalization or pressuring or search for equality but rather one of actual grievance where they believe that the system is rigged against them and they're frustrated with that\nSo James and two colleagues of his Helen plug grows and Peter ... and they got seven out of twenty of these hoax studies published now we should note here all of these hoaxes or self described liberals and James says all of this reveal something wrong with left wing academia\nWe care about how these topics are covered and were sick and tired of looking at this political circus that's dominating our political landscape right now okay we figure we feel like the left has ... has ...\nIs Helen plug grows and Peter ... and they got seven out of twenty of these hoax studies published now we should note here all of these hoaxes or self described liberals and James says all of this reveal something wrong with\nLeft wing academia\nWe care about how these topics are covered and were sick and tired of looking at this political circus that's dominating our political landscape right now okay we figure we feel like the left has ... has ... and we're on the left we need to clean up the left and we hope the rights to do it too\nYeah and just to narrow down on that when you say these topics and things like gender studies square studies ray studies that kind of area\nYes exactly a gender studies the study of race gender sexuality um anything to do with identity really needs to be done right and needs to be done carefully and he's been rigorously\nAnd it needs to not leave a vacuum into which um say the right wing pundits can can fill the space and and gain traction gotcha\nSo I just want to make sure that I'm understanding this and want to kind of make it digestible I hear you saying that some Wayne is in the fields of gender studies ... studies race studies have gone too far\nCarefully and he's been rigorously and it needs to not leave a vacuum into which um say the right wing pundits can can fill the space and and gain traction gotcha\nSo I just want to make sure that I'm understanding this and want to kind of make it digestible I hear you saying that some wing is in the fields of gender studies course studies race studies have gone too far and that you wanted these hoax studies to prove that\nYeah ... in a sense what we wanted to prove was that they are relying upon broken methodologies that allow them to launder ideas through the scholarly process so they can start with some opinion or even a prejudice and push it through the scholarly process because there seemed to be flaws and how that materials being evaluated by the peer review system\nAnd then it comes out looking like knowledge on the other side\nGotcha so then what did you want these hoaxes to accomplish it do you want to diminish these fields of study do you want certain scholars to go away do you want certain journals to go away what did you want to tangibly happened as a result of these studies I Would like\nThe scholarship on these these topics which is incredibly important be done better I'd like to see rigorous worked on where\nEvaluated by the peer review system and then it comes out looking like knowledge on the other side\nGotcha so then what did you want these hoaxes to accomplish it do you want to diminish these fields of study do you want certain scholars to go away do you want certain journals to go away what did you want to tangibly happened as a result of these studies I Would like to see\nThe scholarship on these these topics which is incredibly important be done better I'd like to see rigorous worked on where where criticism that comes from the outside and outside and says hey you know this methodology doesn't work or this\nBlatantly disagrees with with what
