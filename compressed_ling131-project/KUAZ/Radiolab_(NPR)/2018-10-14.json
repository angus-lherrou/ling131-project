it came to be and how it's changed over time\nAnd what it means for the ... community to them like when Bob grew up in the sixties you could get locked up for even going to a gay bar it was a very different times so Bob's first coming out actually wasn't until Nineteen Seventy four after he just had his first same sex experience\nBob told his best friend who he thought might also be gay\nI was

big big big risk and we'll are a lot\nThat's Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on ABC sitcoms\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nI remember this year I was like Thirteen ... and I remember I don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch wow that make the ... and I and I probably thought later it's not just to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out\nOn her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah\n[laughter] oh God I remember that old I remember right\nExactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody\nI think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch [laughter] wow that make the ... and I and I probably thought later it's not just to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out\nOn her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah [laughter] oh God I remember that that old I remember right right\nExactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody you know that I I click with and obviously you didn't click with Richard has there ever been any one you sell to click with them\nAnd what was his name from citizen [noise]\nThey both have the young too much [laughter]\nI don't know I guess I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen\nI mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house the picket fence you know a dog or cat Sunday barbecues someone to love someone who loves me something I can build a life with just I just want to be happy and you think\nI don't know I as I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just living normal life\nAnd what isn't normal life Ellen\nNo normal I mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house the picket fence you know a dog and cat Sunday barbecues someone you love someone loves me when I can build a life with just I\nJust want to be happy and you think you can't have these things with a woman\nWell society has a pretty big problem with it you know there are a lot of people out there who think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades ... the backlash that she face ... was pretty I lost the show all these conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show ABC actually\nPut an adult content warning on episodes of Ellen that showed a woman kissing a woman\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine airing um snow in April in Nineteen Ninety seven the afternoon before that episode aired of Ellen a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council\nBy ads on the show [noise] ABC actually put an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman [noise] there was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine area and I'm so in April in Nineteen Ninety seven\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear it\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the gay characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that\nBut not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids or you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue or the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible bigots\nWow wow [noise]\nSo funny she says there's an agenda here to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah yeah they mail is appalling [laughter] the whole he hate kids it's okay you can try to um it was fascinating\nIt's a you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there's no right and wrong in this issue of the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible ...\nWow wow [noise]\nSo funny she says there's an agenda to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah yeah the real is appalling [laughter] the whole he hates kids it's okay you can try to\nUh it was fascinating to hear it 'cause that's of course what they were terrified about that it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um [noise]\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly and can I jump up and I know we're going decade by decade outdoors go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it\nI'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleven\nIs when it appeared um and he sets off of rain blow flag waving firestorm really of protests when he says don't come out you say people like clear people stopped coming out and do we get back on from Nineteen Ninety\n... she might have already seen it I'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh\nIs when it appeared um and he sets off of rain blow flag waving firestorm really of protest when he says don't come out you say people like queer people stopped coming out in the ... gone from Nineteen Ninety seven Ellen coming out and it's a big deal\nTo twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm don't do it academically and don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay so for one\nAnd this is debatable America this is a quote America's a safer place than twenty Seventeen on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nNo I'm paraphrasing he's you know we have to proclaim sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it they don't whereas right heterosexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out or no one should maybe heterosexual people should come out on October\nKind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nSo I'm paraphrasing ... you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it but they don't wear as head of sexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out for no one should\nMake the heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people\nAnd that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now you know you think an R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and she came out but he never use the word gay right you know do you think about Jodie Foster Amos Lee kind of came out\nOf the globe's we actually have paper that [noise]\nBut I'm just going to put it out there right loud and proud right so I'm underneath your support on [noise]\n\nI think\nHe came out but he never use the word gay right you know you think about Jodie Foster yeah even as the kind of came out a Globes we actually have paper that\nYou know I'm just going to put out there right loud and proud right so I'm underneath your support on [noise]\n\nI think\nI already did my coming out about a thousand years ago back in the\nOpen up to trust your friends and family co workers and then gradually probably to everyone who knew her everyone's actually\nBut now apparently I'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life with a press conference a fragrance at a price on that\nWe have a point in my mind goes should have a point and should we be forced should anybody be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be coming out yeah and\nSee this is where we go back to it being both a personal any political choice and I think the personal has to come first and I think you know you and I know the the list of celebrities who we all sort of\nBut life without press conference or fragrance enterprise I'm\nA born like go to have a point should we be forced should anybody be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be coming out yeah and\nSee this is where we go back to it being both a personal and political choice\nAnd I think the personal has to come first and I think that you know you and I know the the list of celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know amount\nAnd you really want to come out and who flirt with it much like foster did [noise]\nUm and then for whatever reasons whether it's the mentally ill\nUm whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know they decide not to or they don't yet or they wait or whatever and I think I think there's got to be room for that too I Do I care more about whether people get in the way of

feels to me\nTo be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white and my ... yes yeah ... and yeah and if you are already\nHailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of your

um\nAnd it's a complicated place because I grew up in the church and the church is actually where I feel I came into my\n... out of work I mean like I felt safe there like as a young black boy in the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of correct but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit mhm it was this weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there\nYeah I mean the church is where I was encouraged to um express myself which you know I was a big old clean love 'em and and the choirs than a singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos\nSection and I'm sure they ate it up I'm sure they loved it there will be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age because you've sent\nYet ... not in my church of God okay [laughter] but many charges were doing but many are absolute and still do and you'll do and so yeah it it's a really a controversy\nThan a singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos section and I'm sure they ended up I'm sure they loved it there will be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age because you've sent yet ... not in my church oh God okay [laughter]\nBut many charges were doing but many are absolute and still do\nAnd ... and so yeah it it's a really a\nConcert [laughter] right yeah no but that that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low yeah phenomena and also we should stop to define with the downloads for those who might not know\nYes so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not intend to fight as gay\nAnd they're usually black and only allowed to fail for men other than black man\nYes I'm even though that's not true [laughter]\nWell I mean like you have these euphemisms for like white man they yeah but they live in a double life you know yeah the lead a double life yeah\nWhy does it say about what coming out has become where you move from Harvey Milk in the seventies coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time\nA lot of yell for men other than black man\nYes I'm even though that's not true [laughter]\nWell I mean like ... for like white man they but they were living in a life you know the lead a double life yeah\nWhy does it say about what coming out has become where you move from Harvey Milk in the seventies to coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time the subset of the community black man they're still being labeled with this term deal so\nAt the same time that yes there was a part of the community that we're not being open there was another part that was actually being\nVery open in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of a black in Latin next lesbians\nWere open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing are pushing back against the second wave feminist movement\nWas white straight middle class women and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well\nA radical group of a black in Latin next lesbians\nWere open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing are pushing back against the second wave feminist movement\nWas white straight middle class women and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lord a Sheree Miranda Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these black lesbians yeah and like lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history is not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about his sexuality or in total some make that decision [laughter] but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat choice can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on ... riots there another listener who shared a coming out
