girls private love letters from mysteriously males to all of our crushes I think it's really cool that you think I have called inspection my eyes\nTo let her through then there was this\nOther one

course so good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely\nFeel retro that I feel like it stokes a particular part of my heart same\nSame so these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get the scribe has to watch from any comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world is\nFeel like it stokes a particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get the scribe has to watch romantic comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of love very closely\nHer name is Gwen I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I haven't been kind of geeky\nNow for several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer\nAnd now you didn't even now [noise] um\nThey called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love with like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfair\nFor your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I have been kinda ... out\nFor several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer I Know you didn't even now [noise] um they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer\nA that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even number of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching these rom coms my big question in first question about all of this is like what\nLed Netflix no or think that rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take the rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix say well this might work for us\nI think they just spied on completely underserved markets\nMy big question and first question about all of this is like what\nLed Netflix no or think that rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take to rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will just might work for us\nThink they just spied on completely underserved market you know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book critic offshoots\nYeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want\nLike just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you kind of out of luck so for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces\nTo have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you were kind of out of luck so for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been\nUnder used and it's worked out really well for them yeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters widely left rom coms\nWrit large I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more ... billion dollars bat gym with rom coms there was a a golden era\nKnow when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put the ground with anybody like let's move on to build up next why not [noise] but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon and Vince vaughan and for Christmases and the tank and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back and it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband than to go on to see a movie that's\nJim with rom coms there was a a golden era\nKnow when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put Graham with anybody like I said it was on double up next why not ... but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases tanked and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that's you know romance seems like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms honor and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars in your lovely ... end up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with the Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's\nAnd then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms genre and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars and see a lovely couple ended up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going out to yeah\nI'm should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because I mean crazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want you know a lovely\nThat's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because I mean crazies rich Haitians did so well because we just want a you know a
