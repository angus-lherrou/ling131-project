court\nHe just honestly what opportunity to win together or we didn't have to come together but I mean we didn't even have the chance at least originally we did it\nSo you want it to run on the homecoming court as a keen but the school administration told her that only boys can be canes and only girls can be queens the soda and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually\nWe just want to say just want the opportunity to win together or we didn't have to work together but I mean we didn't even have the chance

story said that this made it impossible for gay couples to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day they decided to have no gender titles in the homecoming contest no ... no queens\nOn the homecoming court would just be known as quote royals but that didn't make facilities in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward part it's another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this they think they were over compensating rather than just reading and that well it shouldn't\nHave been at a gym there they should have just made it so you are voting ... regardless of gender that just shows whether or not they were now that the king or queen or anything in between and it was up to that it wasn't up

environment for all students and staff\nIncluding those who identify as el GB teach you plus since the Jane Sicilian story happened dealing with the fallout I'll just do support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they said that they don't think that the school or did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't what home coming to post ... about\nUm outside Austin people that are hearing about it that comment on line they're not very positive what's been the worst kind of comments\nThat originally basically saying that we're that we're not washing\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't what home coming to post ... about\nUm outside of Austin ... glitter hearing about it a common cause they're not very positive what's been the worst kind

done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made me think\nLike Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country and so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an allied to these young women but\nEven they can't figure out what the right language is\nThey've been dealing with this fall out some students support than others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made me think\nLike Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for
