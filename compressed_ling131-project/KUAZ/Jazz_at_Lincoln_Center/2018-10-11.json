for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised it by YouTube book on the program\nThanks for having me show talk to me about how you came to work on this story\nI have a two year old and a five year old that scene toddler YouTube and I was like what are all these things all these brands I've never heard of\nThese companies all over the world and I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed in this kind of animation that to me it looks kind of pre Pixar if you know what I mean\nHuh okay there lots to unpack in there because the idea first of all of toddler you to what what is that is it as it sounds so Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for\nYou know one year olds ... year old three year old this and that's what I call tons of YouTube and it's this kind of wild place well [laughter]\nI I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them\nOf toddler you to what what is that is it as it sounds\nSo Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know when you're old tree ... three year old is and that's what I call toddler YouTube and it's this kind of\nLike wild place well [laughter] I I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them all almost as much as adults it kind of seems\nI mean YouTube is by far the most popular brand among children and even little children have their own favorites to one of the biggest brands within the space has called choo choo TV\nYou know they have a Nineteen billion view is they have twenty nine million subscribers this is a global children's entertainment ... kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back with the the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street and children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all that was to educate not necessarily want a two year olds but you know slightly older toddlers\nAll children entertain ... kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back with the the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street in children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all of that was to educate not necessarily want a two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that the mission of of toddler YouTube in ... to TV is that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they've banned entertainment they've been just trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realized that they've done that\nAnd they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producers on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube it's good for kids rather than just something that affects up their time\nWell so spit bullet for me do you think that's going to work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense\nSo what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producers on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube that good for kids rather than just something that affects up their time\nWell so spit bullet for me do you think that's gonna work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube's do\nNot really on the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business is obviously much different and the biggest difference is there's just YouTube basically decision issues where kids are going this is where the whole businesses\nAnd say
