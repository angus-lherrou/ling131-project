I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis of we've reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney\nPossible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all and the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use ... welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that\nWhole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nBe crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed bottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them\nOn whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nYou know just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport and be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as uh\nIn a place that was legal there would be

it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nFrom the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that\nBy the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like

BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that
