home\nHi Michael thanks so much for talking with us I Do and thanks for having me see how to tell us how your obsession with the world of vinegar came about\nI think the same way most people make vinegar the first time a accidentally leaving a bottle of red wine out and open on the table but\nIt kind of snowball into a couple of other alcohol and had a leftover quarter keg that I poured into a barrel and it turned into the basketball vinegar I've ever had in my life so definitely a happy accident it it is and now it's a absurd obsession\n[laughter] now your book reveals vinegar to be so

is and now it's a absurd obsession\n[laughter] now your book reveals vinegar to be so much more of our sun and the kitchen that we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nYeah vinegar as a flavor carrier it's not just this overt thing that kind of\nPunches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce so you know when you make a big red either two two one two or three to one ratio oil to vinegar um you're actually trying to express the nuances in the Roma individual gr by carrying it in that fat\nAnd that kinda carries over and a lot of cooking process to use it de glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites and Marines or it is a really interesting

kind of like what Irish ... bread is a you know using that as a full Evan\n[noise] one of the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organize part of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us some examples of vinegar that are unique to certain places and how they're used [noise]\nGonna go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but those sauces have vinegar in them have some kind of a city to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar in Holland days most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient\nI'm going to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of

vinegar in Holland days most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving in Italy I just got back from a trip or in the mail you remind your region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original boss amok vinegar which really wasn't exported to the states if not worlds until like the Nineteen seventies a such a small amount is made that a lot of people having even experienced it so seeing that vinegar in contacts and seeing that it's\nBarely used as an application where you heat it up you know on top of a little age parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes vinegars from single ingredients a tomato saffron\nSmall amount is made that a lot of

then you have things like ... an Asian cuisines\nThis was another thing that I had only really experienced\nYou know ... counter American race vinegar the things you buy an supermarkets but when you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a there is so much\nExpression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and race vinegar can be the same way there isn't just acidity there there is flavor are dependent on what kind of race they use and how much is polished down and on top of that\nPico ...
