it's worked out like yeah I think I Want and she didn't win because\nI like through my arm up in the air as in a gesture and she had her knife in the air and I cut the tendon in my finger so I had to

was me and Jose Luis and we're looking at everything for those two weeks old she was gone but what happened is when she came home\nShe was gung ho to put about you know four or five Indian dishes on the menu we did ... like little vegetable freighters we did a puente pancake we made doll and curry and\nDid it shot navy and right and\nIt was really like immediately we just incorporated into the menu so it was all these rustic French things and a bunch of Indian\nThing [laughter] yeah so that and and I had been so inspired over there by all the flavor profiles and just that it was such an

put a fire underneath that by\nThe women were out on the porch grinding spices making all the different bread than it was so inspiring that it just was something I felt like we have to put these things on the menu and then\nAbout a year later Mary Sue took her first trip she didn't cut me right before she laugh at that [laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand\nSimilar experience yeah my uncle was there and he I landed up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and it was had a big very very authentic type buffet and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook for the king and queen of Thailand for ten years hordes and she didn't speak any English and I didn't speak any tae Bo\nShe didn't cut me right before she left [laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand\nAnd had a very similar experience yeah my uncle was there and he landed up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and it had a big very very authentic type of fate and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook for the king and queen of Thailand for ten years hordes\nAnd she didn't speak any English and I didn't speak any time but you know we got along immediately and we cook together all day every day for three weeks and then same thing I came home and we were\nYou know time Ellen salad and Chinese sausage salad anti red curry duck and I'm scallops and oh my gosh we have pictures that are just amazing and so then you know that our menu them became had cats to lay and then duck red curry\nAnd then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then you know ... and so it was a\nMixed like that and one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half and we were like what happened I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah and then I you know we were we this is how season and I kinda\nCats to lay and then duck red curry and then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then you know al ... and so it was a very mixed like\nThat and one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half\nAnd we were like what happened I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd then I you know we were we this is how student and I kind of work together we're in the kitchen going oh you remember those chicken breast we we've got to use them today no matter what we can't let 'em go another day okay well let's just let's make a sausage outta that chicken breast with a lot of ... stuff it into the rigatoni and then\nI don't know what do you think of let's just try with cream and parmesan anyway that rigatoni became like a signature dish that everybody ordered and so we had to tell the pasta company can you make our rigatoni long all of them [laughter]\nAnd literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other ... other inspiration comes from people that work for us it someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement but not uh\nEverybody ordered and so we had to tell the pasta company can you make our rigatoni long all of them [laughter]\nAnd literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other ... other inspiration comes from people that work for us that someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement bananas\nOr you see something in the market and when we first decided to turn city cafe into a little tiny Mexican restaurant called border grill we went to Mexico for three weeks we drove around in a little tiny VW Bug and we\nYou know asked a trillion questions of everybody we could find\nAnd but if we'd go to the market and see something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how do you use it with this chili that I remember we discovered ... chilies and we'd nobody nobody knew what a Chipotle he was more or less a chain of restaurants but it was Nineteen eighty five yeah\nYeah I mean we didn't you know that that first trip to Mexico we stay well our little kitchenette city cafe was myself and Mary Sue ended in a dishwasher but then eventually we hired like a ... student who came in you know probably\nAsk people what it is how to use it with this chili that I remember we discovered Chipotle eat chilies and we'd nobody nobody knew what a Chipotle he was more or less a chain of restaurants but it was Nineteen eighty five yeah\nYeah I mean we didn't you know that that first trip to Mexico we stay\nWell our little kitchenette city cafe was myself and Mary Sue ended in a dishwasher but then eventually we hired\nLike a ... student who came in you know probably wanted like Eighteen dollars now is that none of them will hire you for like five dollars an hour or whatever ... whatever minimum wage yeah [laughter] and I said okay so he came to work for his name was ... and\nWe loved him and we ended up going to Mexico City and staying with his parents in their home and his mom took us\nEvery day for a few days to the market this is our first chip and we'd like bought everything that we didn't know what it was and come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about\nMexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around where we just like ate everything we wrote our first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu and literally\nGet this is our first trip and we like bought everything that we didn't know what it was and come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about\nMexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around\nWhere we just like ate everything we rode out first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu and literally we had to take our notebook out like with the new shows or what they are deep as we couldn't remember what they even worse [laughter]\nYou know called and so we were constantly looking at are now but but that was sort of the beginning of border grill that was the beginning\nWow I Can't I keep thinking about the timeframe or this is in the early to mid eighties this was not stuff that was happening and shut the restaurants and\nYou know people starting today have such a different frame of reference from that and I think ... they probably grew up with you know their favorite Thai restaurant that they want to you know with their family and their favorite Mexican place where they went to and all that stuff all that stuff is already built into so many American pilots as they're growing up no right\nYou know when we opened city so the bigger version when we open city restaurant in it\nChef ie restaurants and\nYou know people starting today have such a different frame of reference them and I think ... they they probably grew up with you know their favorite Thai restaurant that they want to you know with their family and their favorite Mexican place so they went to and all that stuff all that stuff was built into so many American politics are growing up though right\nYou know when we opened city so the bigger version\nWhen we open city restaurant and it was then food that was influence from cities all around the world ... we put a ton dory of and in and we got that ... even from a owner of a Indian\nA hotel he was an Indian man we went downtown in a pickup truck and picked up this on fire tend to hurry up and so it's just rock clay that's been dry and it's like held together with elephant hair\nAnd we brought it back in the back of a pickup truck hoping we wouldn't hit too big a bomb so that it would crack and then we learned all about how to fire it and then we spent one day like fourteen hours where you have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their bodies so we could stick our our ... in there because you\nClay that's been dry and it's like held together with elephant hair\nAnd we brought it

have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their bodies so we could stick our arm in there because you had to keep\nRushing the sides with a brown sugar and mustard while in order to glaze it and we played Indian music and incense and then finally you know the night before our opening party and Ruth Rachel was there that night and wolf\nWe may we that night like at three in the morning we finally made our first batch of non uh-huh and you can't even looked like a dirty side of any kind of out of the oven\n[laughter] well interestingly you talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right we didn't know what that meant you know an opening it was just completely seat of the pants\nAnd we were dead out of money we had to open because we needed some cash we couldn't even buy groceries so we had been in the kitchen with our health department uh\nEven looked like a dirty side by side that out of the oven [laughter] well\nInterestingly you talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right and we didn't know what that meant you know an opening it was just
