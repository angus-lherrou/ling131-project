moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved

had no idea who she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for

my gosh the list goes on ... road and yes the diary of Anne Frank famously edge of a week and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author is or English writing I should say cookbook author and she published and Lewis is most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd then interviewing Judith Jones about his work it became apparent to me that her book that you did with mess Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away from working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing\nThe

the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and women's movements civil rights Vietnam War has come to an end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion

you when you say that came late [noise]\nWell you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food up in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history and the American south of of really\nFull the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another\nBut if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day ... this is a work of African American history and the American south and it's a really giving dignity to that portray as it's known entity in a lot of ways that's\nSeparate from white American culture mhm\nSo I I wrote a story about a new loose a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up and and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I didn't think it before mhm\nIncluding but I think this idea of the face of the country cooking as being a with a political work when you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as or just a sweet old lady yes a sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds of people who ... her her grand\nThe face of country cooking as being a way the political work like you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as oh just a sweet old lady yes a sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds like a little ... her her grandparents\nWho are the people who founded the community she grew up in where in slave mhm if they were fighting it slaves at one that's right and\nI think if you think of that story you'd imagine a story that was one of hardship and\nYou know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society the most beautiful community it was a life of beauty literally children are singing in the book yeah and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say hey whatever stereotypes you have of us ... if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine your started at the wrong\nThat's right and that's a profoundly political thing it's a massive correct and I just so much of what had been written in continues to be written that\nLiterally children are singing in the book yeah and I thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say\nHey whatever stereotypes you have of us ... if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine your started after all that's right and that's\nUpper finally political thing it's a massive corrective I think to so much of what had been written in what continues to be written that the life of the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture large series of regional cultures\nThat was one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these meeting communities that were financially pour their life was rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it um and and things that we think that's sort of still is luxury foods meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms mean for us I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves\nYeah ... they're literally making souffle isn't their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fear ... to it too I think is so again maybe subtle and maybe I'm\nPeople and lots of it yeah\nAnd and and things that we think that's sort of still is luxury foods meets cream pot are um foraged mushrooms me for anything I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was you know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves\nYeah like ... they're literally making souffle it in their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fear ... to it too I think is so\nAgain maybe subtle maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small tropical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you started the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nThere's this really incredible image of and they take the bladders out and they blow the butter like balloons and tie them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later my\nCan you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally ... and but also remember reading it and the way she describes\nThe hogs after they've been slaughtered ...\nAlmost sounds I mean the way she described hunting hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit it's it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I\nYou know several months later my\nCan you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally ... and but also remember reading it and the way she describes the hogs after they've been slaughtered ... it almost sounds I mean the way she described hunting hanging quietly like statues\nIt's like that song strange fruit is\nIt's almost like a Lynch scene\nAnd then I found later that when she was young there was a black man in a nearby community to hers\nWho was lynched after he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah\nAnd I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but\nIt's like now you know this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all it's ... [noise]\nI'm In the reality of it I I Can't help but think that you had those things in her mind certainly um I don't know if you wrote them in that scene but\nI think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was selling lynching in her ... you know that that there was incredible ... much he presented us whether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time and and that she was going to see it sort of quietly and\nYou're hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all ... um the reality of it I I Can't help but notice and the other things in her mind certainly um I'm actually wrote them in that scene but\nYeah I think that's what I Am a living with a sense that she was so unfair lynching and her ... you know that that there was incredible Franken is and what she present to do with whether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time\nUm and that she was going to say it sort of quietly and many people who knew her ... her as being a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than needed to be set and sometimes she said nothing at all but if she was going to open her mouth or put pen to paper\nIt was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from hard truths um and then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can see that\nYou know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find both yup paradox and that and I think they're in life her brilliance\nYeah incredible incredible life but you so much the been my pleasure Francis\nSarah Franklin the editor of the Lewis type a table with an American average\nTeacher's food writing at NYU\nThe beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find out you have heart attacks and that and I think they're in life for billions\nYeah incredible incredible life thank you so much to her and my pleasure Francis\nSarah Franklin the editor of Lewis at the table with an American average\nShe teaches writing at NYU and she's also working on a book on Judith Jones is Lewis is legendary editor\nMhm\nOne of the Lewis his deepest friendships was with another ...
