this week technician [noise]\n\nLet's take five with more regarding\nThis it's five minutes [noise]\nA great my credit card got stolen story\nI went to Mexico and upon arriving at the airport picked up my rental car from a major company I use that credit card that one and only one time [noise] several days later I started getting text from my credit card companies like called beforehand\nLet's take five with more regarding\nThis it's five minutes [noise]\nHere's a great my credit card got stolen story and went to Mexico and upon arriving at the airport picked up my rental car from a major company I use that credit cards that one and only one time [noise]\nSeveral days later I started getting texts from my credit card company called beforehand and it for that was going to Mexico\nThey asked I charge there that I charge that\nThe answer was no no no and no called the fraud representative and we cancelled the card and determined\n... percent to send me a new card since it had to go through customs we decided to simply mail it to my home in San Francisco and I would validate it and when I returned [noise]\nAnd as I was literally packing another flurry of front alert text\nMessages regarding charges in Mexico appeared on my phone but my digits were new to me and they were the numbers on a new car gas charges again in Noone Noone knew again\nCard company I told them that the new cards with students\nAnd I would validated when I returned [noise]\nIt as I was literally packing another flurry of fraud alert text\nMessages regarding charges in Mexico appeared on my phone but my digits were new to me and they were the numbers on the new cart gas charges again in no no no again\nCard company I told them that the new card was sitting on\nMy mailbox back home and I certainly hadn't activated it\nI didn't even know the numbers on the car\nCouldn't have used it to charge anything in Mexico or anywhere else for that matter\nAnd there it was plain as day the credit card hadn't been stolen and Mexico but rather me to look like it was stolen there this was an inside job [noise]\nOf the aspects that was so slick about this experience was that the fraudsters knew where I was in that I rented a car charges came from gas stations one for a hundred and fifty dollars then another for two twenty five not insignificant\nThey need to look like it was stolen there this was an inside job [noise]\nOne of the aspects that was so slick about this experience was that the fraudsters knew where I was and then I rented a car charges came for gas stations one for a hundred and fifty dollars then another for two twenty five\nNot insignificant and to the untrained eye totally appropriate [noise]\nOf course a charge the airfare so they knew about that too upon reflection it took context to make the charges believable and then I remembered that I had called the credit card company in advance\nAnd they had due to flee entered one I Would leave and returned so where was the leaks\nGood question you would need all the data to hazard a guess think about it what does it take to connect the dots and make realistic charges who had what data how did they get it how did they piece it together and what might they do [noise]\nFrom a human point of view\nSo where was the leaks\nGood question you would need all the data to hazard a guess think about it what does it take to connect the dots and make realistic charges who had what data how did they get it how did they piece it together and what might they do this [noise]\nA human point of view it wasn't so surprising that the first credit card that been stolen but the second cars being stolen sprang up very loud bill how do you steal a credit card that the owner hasn't received yet the presumption on the part of the fraudsters was that's a new card had been delivered\nStandard operating procedure it was the very without a doubt but it went the extra mile to make it look like other people did it send the fraud investigators off in the wrong direction and if there's one level of interaction\nWhy not others\nSome pretty helpless and wondered what consumers to do about it you and I felt like the answer was not much other than to participate fully when you get a notification of ...\nIt was the very without a doubt but it went the extra mile to make it look like other people did it send the fraud investigators often the wrong direction and if there's one level of interaction why not others\nI felt pretty helpless and wondered what consumers to do about it you and I\nFelt like the answer was not much\nOther than to participate fully when you get a notification of potential fraud\nYour personal experience just might crack the case yes this was a cat and mouse game All right or rather a card and mouse game if I'm where again this is five minutes [noise]\nFive minutes is produced at the studios of cake you weedy up I'm In San Francisco [noise]\nFive minute to the production of technician media [noise]\nFrom San Francisco I'm Moira gun and this is technician\nToday on technician what happens to all that medical data we've accumulated over time and will be accumulating from here on out I speak with Dr Eric shot the dean of precision medicine at the Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai and the founder and CEO\nFrom San Francisco I'm a lawyer a gun and this is technician\nToday on technician what happens to all that medical data we've accumulated over time and will be accumulating from here on out\nI speak with Dr Eric shot the dean of precision medicine at the I can school of medicine at Mount Sinai and the founder and CEO of semi for\nThen on technician health work on a vaccine to treat and potentially prevent Alzheimer's Dr AJ Vermont from United neuro science talks about their efforts and chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft tells us about the age wave it's about to break\nOver our lives we've all had plenty of blood test X rays now genetic tests and more with technology the information about our health status is growing quickly\nI asked Eric shot the founder and CEO of semi before what does that growth of information I mean\nThe growth of information means you know first of all the digital universe of data has grown up with such\nOver our lives we've all had plenty of blood test X rays now genetic tests and more with technology the information about our health status is growing quickly\nI asked Eric shot the founder and CEO of semi for what does that growth of the information being\nThe growth of information means you know first of all the digital universe of data has grown up with such speed you know that we're now up to you know is that a bite of data seem to be a Yoda bite of data which is so\nUnimaginably ... Iowa in Star Wars I had to look that went up because I had no idea what came out ... you know tear a ton of\nIn what you saw in the field of medicine in particular is we went from ... to settle bites skipped right over ... like nobody even heard of but so it's so it's a such data built up around you you mentioned some of the sources but think about the iPhone\nOr or other smart device you carry with you and the GPS coordinates and that those GPS coordinates our sample that high frequency overtime and they've Lincoln the geographic information systems\nThat have things like what's the temperature\nMedicine in particular is we went from ... to settle bites skipped right over ... like nobody even heard of that [laughter] but so it's so it's a such data built up around you you mentioned some of the sources but think about the iPhone\nOr or other smart device you carry with you and the GPS coordinates and that those GPS coordinates our sample that high frequency overtime and they've Lincoln the geographic information systems\nThat have things like what's the temperature and the pollen counts and the traffic flow and the electricity usage and on and on and on just these really holistic profiles that can be built up around you and interpret you know what's happening in the environment that you're existing in and how might it explain\nSome of the um things you have going on with you whether it's I feel tired all the time or I'm having allergy problems or I or even even have abnormal test results that my physician can now be more and more accurately predicted you know from this data that can be built up around you so it means both\nBetter insights into what's happening with you and better ability to predict\nA but it also means or remove all of of any kind of privacy because all of this data built up around you uniquely identifies you any high dimensional sets of ...\nOh gee problems or I or even even have abnormal test results up my physician can now be more and more accurately predicted you know from this data that can be built up around you so it means both better insights into what's happening with you and better ability to predict\nA but it also means or remove all of of any kind of privacy because all of this data built up around you uniquely identifies you any high dimensional sets of data\nThat exist around you are very very specific to you\nYou're the only one in this body walking around this way you're pattern of\nA walking speed your gate a wet stores you visit food how you use your phone here's how you use your phone number ... ... ... if you have access to somebody else to use your phone and he gave it to your sons saying you know I don't need this anymore fella\nImmediately it would be very simple to analyze that it is not using that town you got to it as somebody else you got it yeah so it's a [noise]\nSomebody else do you use your phone and he gave it to your signs saying you know I don't need this anymore fella immediately it would be very simple to analyze that it is not using that found you got to it as somebody else\nJust whatever is has been collected about it we just don't want to lose it because it may become relevant later but you don't need to move through this integrated data cloud all the time of everything's fine\nIt's a it's one of the things we hope to change is this this idea\nIn medicine today we treat diseases is very black and white it's either you're sick or you're not sick and that as we know is is not true right diseases occur on a continuum spectrum and you're either always moving towards that state\nOr you're in a well state and you're able to resist a are getting those diseases but the only way you can track something like that is to not be coming in\nAnd medicine today we treat diseases is very black and white it's either you're sick or you're not sick in that as we know is is not true right diseases occur on a continuum of spectrum and you're either always moving towards that state\nOr you're in a well state and you're able to resist a are getting those diseases but the only way you can track something like that is to not be coming in in in a\nWay that I had to say that\nEven when I hear well like just again even when while individuals if you can well if you can\nLook at information around as well individuals and map out what trajectory are you really honor you on a trajectory that's going to resist all of these common diseases that played a lot of us or are you on a trajectory that's that's gonna be catastrophic and five years time like if you do not bounce off that path\nYou're going to have lots of problem will both the while individuals want to know am I not only am I on a good path but how do I stay on that path like what are the right kinds of interventions like what are the right\nKinds of foods are exercises or what drugs shouldn't I tape because I'm more sensitive I'm going to have an adverse event like all of that information or can be leverage to\nOn their trajectory that's that's gonna be catastrophic in five years time like if you do not bounce off that path\nYou're going to have lots of problem will both the while individuals want to know am I not only am I on a good path but how do I stay on that path like what are the kinds of interventions like what are the right kinds of foods are exercises or what drugs shouldn't I tape because I'm more sensitive I'm going to have an adverse event like all of that information\nOr can be leverage to say how do you maintain a a more well more robust\nA state of wellness so I think it applies to both like they're all in this continuum in in the push has to be how do we get more probabilistic in our understanding of the these diseases not black and white binary as if you just one day had a heart attack and nobody saw that coming [laughter] you know we know that's not true\nOne event that happens and it said an advantage over months what event that happens too many lemon and sometimes multiple times in the course of their lives his pregnant say at the moment you become pregnant\nEverything changes he got he got baby on board\nWe really start that journey or before you were pregnant and that's a everything from\nYou know we know that's not true\nOne event that happens and it's at an event over months what event that happens too many women and sometimes multiple times in the course of their lives is pregnant say at the moment you become pregnant\nEverything changes he got he got baby on board\nWe really start that journey or before you're pregnant\nAnd that's a everything from um assessing your current state of wellness so what are what are you at risk of even before you become pregnant\nOf complications that can happen in pregnancy so think just station all diabetes Priya clams preterm birth period natal depression all sorts of things can happen during her pregnancy and if you're better understand that risk at the beginning you can better manage a that Journey Through it through its course [noise]\nUm we also start with the genetics I'm like what are you as a mom and your reproductive health partner what are you at high risk of passing on to your offspring\nUm that would be catastrophic so think of things like a taste sacks a disease or cystic fibrosis you know these kinds of diseases that if you knew you were at high risk you would um\nAt the beginning you can better manage a that Journey Through it through its course [noise]\nUm we also start with the genetics I'm like what are you as a mom and your reproductive health partner what are you at high risk of passing on to your offspring\nUm that would be catastrophic so think of things like a taste sacks a disease or cystic fibrosis you know these kinds of diseases that if you knew you were at high risk you would\nUm you know may be a you know they do fertilization you would say okay I'm going to have these embryos fertilized and I'm going to pick ones that don't aren't going to pass this disease on\n'em once you're pregnant your uh you know there's non invasive prenatal testing that that we do and again our whole aim as you know can we help um the woman you kind of manage that journey the information around her and again provide better\nInsights into the risks are that that she'll be I'm exposed to through the through that course\nAh and then even wants to babies born you know you have a depression related issues that can arise and they're even issues within the unborn child or the I'm Sorry ... the newly born child a so think of a rare disorders or that sometimes don't matter\nKind of manage that journey the information around her and again provide better insights into the risks uh that that she'll be I'm exposed to through the through that course\nOr and then even wants to babies born you know you have a depression related issues that can arise and they're even issues within the unborn child or the I'm Sorry for the newly born child\nA so think of a rare disorders or that sometimes don't manifest until your one or two if you could detect those at birth or some conditions where if you knew them at birth you could give a an intervention that would lead to a normal life [noise]\nUm if they go one to two years when it clinically manifest you've lost twenty IQ points and you're never getting those points back like so just being able to test at birth to say you know do does my child to have any condition that can be treated from day one\nUm like those are the sorts of things about this technology is bringing to bear on on that pregnancy journey\nLet's say we have a patient I'll find that really wants to do this are we seeing pushback from actually [noise]\nSo we it it it's a it's a mixed today or some of the things like the care\nEarth to say you know do does my child to have any condition that can be treated from day one um like those are the sorts of things about this technology is bringing to bear on on that pregnancy journey\nLet's say we have a patient I'll find that really wants to do this but we think pushback from doctrine [noise]\nAbsolutely so we it it it's a it's a mixed today or some of the things like the\nCarrier screening I mentioned at the beginning or what you should be getting before you're becoming pregnant and the non invasive prenatal testing those are kind of standard of care or they very rapidly became standard of care you know probably three or four years ago the standard of care for carrier screening was like four\nTo eight or diseases that are a\nProfessional bodies recommended or you know today we're testing for for hundreds you know like it's moved really fast up at that's become rapidly standard of care because it's had such a positive impact on reproductive health choices about things like newborn screening definitely pushback on\nYou know a controversy around um [noise]\nYou know ... what are the advanced\nA a professional bodies recommended a young today we're testing for for hundreds you know like it's moved really fast but that's become rapidly standard of care because it's had such a positive impact on reproductive health choices\nAbout things like newborn screening definitely pushback on\nYou know a controversy around um [noise] you know ... what are the advantages and disadvantages like what are the risks that somebody gets in having that information generated um if they are tested for a condition where you don't know exactly what to do it creates anxiety it creates stress\nI'm you know is that a good thing or a bad thing and so there's lots of studies we and others are running to try to help figure out\nUm about what I feel like as we can ever had in the sand and pretend like this isn't happening like we\nWe have to engage um you know individuals in studies we have to engage a broader societies legislators regulatory bodies like we all have to kind of figure this out together I bet you're not going to stop it like it's a you mentioned twenty three and me ancestry like there are these consumer facing direct to consumer efforts\nWhere you know there is no regulatory body involved it's you know you you as consumers\nFeel like as we can't have her head in the sand and pretend like this isn't happening like we we have to engage um you know individuals in studies we have to engage a broader societies legislators regulatory bodies like we all have to kind of figure this out together I bet you're not going to stop it like it's a\nYou mentioned twenty three Emmy ancestry like there are these consumer facing direct to consumer efforts\nWhere you know there was no regulatory body involved it's you know you you as a consumer can decide you want that information and you can submit that up to various Web pages and they'll give you interpretations like we we have to like that waves here and it's you have to figure out how to ride it or maybe help guide it\nUh but uh so that that's how we view it and the the pushback we get is okay well let's work with the let's do carry out the right kind of study or or let's restrict\nWhat we report back to only things where we can do something about it so we're not going to test you for are you at high risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's 'cause as a baby what are you going to do about that information um but if you have\nA G six pd deficiency 'em knowing that at birth you all you have to do is change your diet and you won't get any of the clinical ah affects from that from that deficiency like something that some\nOr let's restrict what we report back to the only things where we can do something about it so we're not going to test you for are you at high risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's 'cause as a baby what are you going to do what you do about that information um but if you have\nA G six pd deficiency\n'em knowing that at birth you oh you have to do is change your diet and and you won't get any of the clinical ah affects from that from that deficiency like something that simple as not tested for in in in newborn screening panels at the state level like why wouldn't you want to know that information\nSo a lot of it is giving actionable information to the position where they know what to do\nAnd they can guide the patient on on what they can do\nWell Eric ... for about ten years we don't have that kind of time [laughter] and I'm Sorry if I was rambling on oh I was like oh yeah cats cats in it and what you're saying here\nUh but but we ... we're looking at here is a whole ... of information you know ... and and how it in ... and how we're supposed to relate to it and what we can do and\nAll of that it's all coming at us you know I've been saying like it's coming at us which it's finally here and it's really here so I Do hope\n[laughter] I'm Sorry if I was remembering\nOh no I was like oh yeah catch it and I'll catch it at catching what you're saying here uh but but what you look we're lucky that here is a whole ... of information you know and and and how it in her late and how we're supposed to relate to it and what we can do and\nAll of that it's all coming at us you know I've been saying like it's coming at us but it's finally here is really here so I Do hope you'll come back and talk to is to get coupons that well thank you\nEric shot is the founder and CEO

itself in about six percent of the people had or what we call them in and joined ...\nAnd so the whole effort had to be stopped\nI'm now mind you some people even though they stopped being ghost did fair pretty well compared to what they might\nAnd what was observed was while the approach worked in animals it look promising early on in clinical development they did run into some safety problems within the immune response that was unleashed did attack the brain itself and about six percent of the people had or what we call them and then joined ...\nAnd so the whole effort had to be stopped\nI'm now mind you some people even though they stopped being does did fair pretty well compared to what they might you might expect and an autopsy or several of them you know showed evidence of amyloid being cleared from the brain so the idea was that this could work if we could just get around the safety issue\nAnd what what our parent company did was figure out how to use the vaccine approach and just to activate one arm of the immune system\nAnd it does it by sort of fooling the immune system into thinking you have an infection on board when you really don't we actually make these little peptide his little bits of of proteins that sort of kind of look like pathogens that all humans are exposed to where there's measles or something else it but they are engineered the artificial\nImmune system gets tricked out there's something there they're going to go after and mount a big response but when they go and interrogated there really isn't [laughter] the the Oregon ... but in the process\nBy sort of fooling the immune system into thinking you have an infection on board when you really don't we actually make these little peptide his little bits of of proteins that sort of kind of look like pathogens that all humans are exposed to whether it's measles or something else but they are engineered the artificial\nYour immune system gets tricked out there's something they're going to go after and mount a big response but when they go and interrogated there really isn't that the Oregon ... but in the process by what we've attached to this construct\nWe we get the immune system to make lots of antibodies against whatever we've attached to this this fake image and if you will\nAnd that seems to work and it seems to be safe it doesn't launch what we call the psycho toxic T cell response which is what is the auto immunity that you see in multiple sclerosis and lupus and a bunch of other diseases\nThat the police got a call they went out to\nThese ... these guys that don't worry about it in the meantime\nIt launched the any\nRight and and because it doesn't really rile up the immune system in a severe way like other vaccines would we don't leave a permanent memory meaning this is not like a one and done a lifetime lifelong now you have this immunity\nGrosses and lupus and a bunch of others as you\nSaid the police got a call they\nAh these ... these guys that don't worry about it in the meantime\nIt launched the anti pot right\nAnd because it doesn't really rile up the immune system in a severe way like other vaccines would\nWe don't leave a permanent memory meaning this is not like a one and done in a lifetime lifelong now you have this immunity so the bit though we activate what's called the beef sell the arm of the immune system and when you do that those ... proliferate and they die out overtime\nSo after vaccinating someone and getting the antibodies level if we stopped dosing those levels will come back down over about you know eight months to a year now if we boost we can get it right back up again\nSo now we can scope the response and keep it elevated as long as we want depending on which disease and what we want to so it's a drug and we anticipate um after priming people in their first year which is really a dosage of flu shots reading your arm just like you get a muscle who shot\nAt baseline one month and three month and then after that we see our antibody levels rise around four months let's say\nAnd then this gently start to come down but if we boost people along the way we can keep it up\n... and keep it elevated so long as we want depending on which disease and what we want to so it's a drug and we anticipate um after priming people in their first year which is really a a dose at least ... flu shots reading your arm just like you get a muscle who shot\nAt baseline one month and three month and then after that we see our antibody levels rise around four months let's say\nAnd then this gently start to come down but if we boost people along the way we can keep it up\nAnd so we are testing various boost dosing frequencies like that\nAnd um you know so far seems to be safe we seem to be able to get good antibodies we think eventually when if we are successful in this becomes a drug this will probably be a like an annual booster so once a year you just ... [laughter]\nYou know re boost up your levels and you monitor I'd just like you'd monitor cholesterol or some other biomarker\nAnd hopefully it'll ward off disease that we have to actually prove this in early disease first\nBut are real hope is that we can do that it'll be safe and more pragmatic so that we can actually moved to prevention\nAnd what are the anybody's doing with respect to awesome [noise]\nIt looks like I'm so antibodies can neutralize\nAnd you monitor it just like you'd monitor cholesterol or some other biomarker and hopefully it'll ward off disease now we have to actually prove this in early disease first but are real hope is that we can do that it'll be safe and more pragmatic so that we can actually moved to prevention\nAnd what are the antibodies doing with respect to awesome [noise]\nIt looks like I'm so antibodies can neutralize some target that you and the math\nAnd we're used to them aiming at viruses and toxins and so on and that's what the traditional vaccines do it looks like and what we're learning about in order to generation is that some normal proteins that do something good in your body your whole life\nLate in life in the brain they tend to mis fold and accumulate as little aggregates that for some reason in the old days the brain has a harder time clearing out\nNow as they accumulate there really um these proteins when they when I say they become miss folded imagine a protein like a necklace than if you scratch it together it can it can have different shapes and show different sides of it [noise]\nUm some of the parts of the protein that are being shown in these aggravates her new they're not there\nThey tend to mis fold and accumulate as little aggregates that for some reason in the old days the brain has a harder time clearing out\nNow as they accumulate there really um these proteins when they when I say they become miss folded imagine a protein like a necklace that than if you scratch it together it can it can have different shapes and showed different sides of it [noise]\nUm some of the parts of the protein that are being shown in these aggravates her new they're not there and throughout your life so I actually look at them as sort of Neal antigens meaning it's something new that your body never saw before [noise]\nSo you might expect your immune system to go and take care of it yeah that's actually what what near me and system does when it sees things like that but mind you this is happening in a time when your aging immune systems weakening a bit\nAnd so maybe it doesn't do so well and some people and maybe a dozen other people it could be that the immune systems actually taking care of this all the time in those people that don't get Alzheimer's people forget that most people don't ... and so what can we learn from them to help you know the less fortunate\nThat turns out that um the leading candidate um the leading antibody in the field is something that you can imagine being developed by by age and and our immune that actually comes from an individual that some\nSo well and some people and maybe a dozen other people it could be that the immune systems actually taking care of this all the time in those people that don't get Alzheimer's people forget that most people don't gills and so what can we learn from them to help you know the less fortunate\nI turns out that um the leading candidate um the leading antibody in the field is something that you can imagine being developed by ... and our immune that actually comes from an individual that somehow happened to have high levels of anti ...\nAnd it did not have ... ... ... you\nKnow we don't know the identity of the subject but the the lower ... I I think this is a healthy subject that did very well that's why the the person was studied but lo and behold they happen to have high levels these antibodies so that's where that's the source of the drug actually it was actually engineered from such a person\nIs is that Henrietta Lacks' story and it's not only adding a layer ... an antibody yes\nIt's a it's a wonderful piece of science but it makes you wonder hey just happening all the time you know as your body of acts immunizing itself against these diseases and that's why some people don't get ill now mind you most of the vaccinations we get in life are not from a vaccine that we get at the doctors is just from getting the flu or the cold or experience\nIt was actually engineered from such a person is is that Henrietta Lacks' story and it's not only adding LA it's ah an antibody yes so it's a it's a wonderful piece of science but it makes you wonder hey is this happening all the time you know as your body of acts immunizing itself against these diseases and that's why some people don't get ill\nNow mind you most of the vaccinations we get in life are not from a vaccine that we get at the doctors is just from getting the flu or the cold or experiences in life we're getting back to an all time from the stuff that we're supposed to end our immune systems learning right\nAnd so really in a in a snapshot we're trying to teach the immune system how to learn better with a vaccine that's really what vaccines do they prepare you how do they get you ready for the real war that's you know you have to fight\nAnd um so that's in a nutshell our approach we think that these mis fold proteins or something that you should get rid of them in late life and we can train the immune system to do it\nNow is just one bad thing you know everybody's focusing on beta amyloid um\nIt's clear that that's a target from the genetics those people that happened to have certain mutations will get Alzheimer's if they have those particular mutations but that may be the only thing that that may be what kicks off the whole you know fire then maybe they can link basically but later on\nThat these missile proteins or something that you should get rid of them in late life and we can train the immune system to do it\nNow is it just one bad thing you know everybody's focusing on beta amyloid um it's clear that that's a target
