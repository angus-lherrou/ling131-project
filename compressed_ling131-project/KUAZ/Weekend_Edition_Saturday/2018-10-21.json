pretending to be here is rather than reading about them a but certainly um since my teen years I've seen a difficulty of Shakespeare and and I went on to\nRead that University in and then teach it at Cambridge but it wasn't until I happened upon this project that I managed to connect these two very disparate parts of my life\nNo the subtitle of your book a Shakespeare in Swahili land is in search of a global poet it's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a a hero of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nWell I think a part of the story is suddenly about cultural imperialism um it's about a British rate is taking Shakespeare to East Africa as a kind of ... to protect them against the dock continent buts what few people realize is that very early on\nIt's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a a hero of of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nWell I think a part of the story is about cultural imperialism um it's about a British rate is taking Shakespeare to East Africa as a kind of ... to protect them against the dock continent\nButs what few people realize is that very early on in his history Shakespeare became detached from Britain from being simply a British possession\nOn and was translated into a wide number of uh of languages\nSo for instance one of the great discoveries in this book was to find that Indians who had taken Shakespeare from British culture back in India but had been proved type it to build the railways in East Africa in the ah the twentieth century\nHad is extraordinary culture all performance of Shakespeare in Mumbai so in nearly twenty century I at one point\nShakespeare was being performed a mall in Mumbai southern in London's west that and\nAnd these were you know glorious Lee irreverent productions much like Shakespeare's own day you know Shakespeare was that was released his check for Bayh was a man of the the us to do what's necessary to get bums on seats to end\nIn East Africa in the twentieth century had is extraordinary culture all performance of Shakespeare in Mumbai site in nearly twenty century I at one point Shakespeare was being performed a more in Mumbai southern in London's west that and\nThese were you know glorious Lee irreverent productions much like Shakespeare's own day you know Shakespeare was that was ... was a man of the the us to do what's necessary to get bums on seats to entertain the audience and these were very much\nShakespeare plays but taken in re made 'em to speak to the people who performing them in Mumbai in nearly twenty century so I think you know as long as things become\nPetrified as long as we you know we didn't put things on a pedestal and insist that they don't change in order to understand them in New ways than setting the Shakespeare can and has come alive in in very very different places than the way he originally wrote the place\nThat's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on a real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to entertain themselves and and make life jolly\nIt's another example of our Shakespeare sort of a appeals to people that several levels were these players when they're used by for instance immigrant labor is from India in East Africa are they\nAnd sit in the Shakespeare can and has come in in very very different places than the way he originally wrote the place\nNow that's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on a real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to entertain themselves and and make life jolly\nIt's another example of our Shakespeare sort of a appeals to people that several levels were these plays when they're used by for instance immigrant laborers from India in East Africa\nAre they adapted to fit the culture or the amped up to be more entertaining a on their level or are they just straight translations of Shakespeare like we would not\nUm no I mean they they are adopted again is a wonderful twelfth night where instead of being shipwreck off the coast of Kenya as happened in Shakespeare's play the opening scene sees a train wreck which sweeps the are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and obviously that's going to speak to people\nWho are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know the hamlet settled movie called ... Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation against spoiler alert here since anyone who's never see for me and Juliet or instead of stabbing herself at the end of the play she uses a poisonous snake in order to kill him\nWhich sweeps they are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and obviously that's kind of speak to people who are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know the hamlet federal ... called ...

poisonous snake\nIn order to kill us which kinda tones are into because that's how again sport or sorry\nUh that's how clear Patrick dollars at the end of Antony and Cleopatra so it's this kind of wonderfully fertile reimagining of the play and one that pact out houses or the U.S.'s\nWith five hundred people every night of the week and these were corrugated on ... in a fledgling city on bass and you know I think it it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East African cities even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature at Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land in search of a global poet Edward is it safe to say I mean you're focuses East Africa but would this be East Africa as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and\nFledgling city I'm On bass and you know I think it it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East Africa in cities even in this uh in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land\nIn search of a global poet Edward is it safe to say\nI mean you're focuses East Africa but would this be\nEast Africa as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and we're going to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet ...\nThey're extraordinary Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia and Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he used as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the explorers he's used by that mission raised to create a written culture of Swahili language\nThat is now a spoken by a hundred million people he's translated into Swahili he's you know he's ... he's Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flash points for talking about the extent to which these countries\nMany different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he used as this kind of um this ... to protect the

these Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flashpoint for talking about the extent to which these countries in the optimum off of colonialism want to be open to the culture of the people who had been colonial over ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYeah so Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to but it's one which hopefully captures\nA set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda\nParts of the Congo along the way in which Swahili is either the main or one of the major languages\nThis also is the region was golf and as a kind of a single entity by the British colony so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices mission raised landed on the coast which is west what he has spoken Swahili is\nKind of very Arabic influenced bend to language and\nUganda parts of the Congo allowing him which Swahili is that the main or one of the major languages\nThis also is the region was golf and as a kind of single entity by the British colony so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices and mission raised landed\nOn the coast which is west what he has spoken Swahili is kind of very Arabic influenced bound to language and as the colonial governments moved inland and ah they would damned if they were going to speak and learn more than one language so they made everyone else learns why he has they moved in and out of what you need is just\nHappens to be a convenient language for the cloning overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism so widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is a legacy of collect list but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created to shed culture between all of the ah African culture within one of these countries in East Africa [laughter]\nNow you talked about uh the missionaries using Shakespeare's what is nineteenth century missionaries and checks for having common when it comes to Swahili that\nThe main character in this story is a chap called ed wood ... who was the the mission ... central\nIt was widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is a legacy of collect list but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created a shed culture between all of the ah African culture within one of these countries in East Africa [laughter]\nNow you talked about uh the missionaries using Shakespeare's what is nineteenth century missionaries and checks for having common when it comes to sway\nThe main character in this story is a ... cold ed wood ... who was the the mission ... Central Africa sent out from Britain\nHe arrives in Zanzibar in Eighteen sixty seven and he isn't machinery and it's his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity but he sees it as central to listen to create least receive so he actually spent a lot of the time\nTrying to understand local culture is translating Swahili ... into English\nAnd trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili he is a translation of ... and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational taxed for schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania for almost a century off\nHe ... into English and trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili he is a translation of channels and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational tax to schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania for almost a century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their faith and in order to do that people had to be literate and missionaries had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a ... a you believe that won gold has created old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this this great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had access to a kind of universal notions of beauty the allowed him to speak this very pure language of beauty and so the assumption was that wherever you ... if you translate it\nOne gold has created old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this is great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had access to a kind of universal notions of beauty the allowed him to speak disparity ... language of beauty and so the assumption was that wherever you ... if you translate to Shakespeare into those languages they would also be able to appreciate\nHave that's one more reason or he could be the global poet he talked in universal terms of beauty and love and humanity\nElectrode toward trash to bear arms chess hard radiolab [noise]\nFail a yeah it's a full body and very and it just seems to me you're suspended get get get get get\nFatalities status on his body and lived up to the mountains\nSunday afternoon at one o'clock here on NPR eighty nine boy one\nElectrodes were attached to their arms trash their heart radiolab\nSay oh it's a full body is very and it just ... years just spend you know get get get get get fatalities that his body and I'd love to talk of the mountains\nAnd the smell doesn't bother you that much my Sunday afternoon at three here on NPR and you know boy one\nWe come from CERN any ...

trip to Iceland as a station I really wanted to make a point that ah that Kay XP would travel to the\nFarthest corners of the earth to find a great music to share with our listeners worldwide really you know music is like travel in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power of music and bring people together\nIt helps create a more tolerant and understanding world as we get to have those experiences through music and get to understand each other through various different types of music and are you've come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place a than sometimes we think it is even when it's\nAway and there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use as your entree into a more intimate connection with that culture can be cuisine that can be art it can be music cups of coffee and a music certainly it's almost like a shape but it's international\nWorld as we get to have those experiences through music and get to understand each other through various different types of music and you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place a than sometimes we think it is even when it's far\nAway and there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use as your entree into a more intimate connection with that culture can be cuisine that can be art it can be music ... and a music certainly it's almost a cliche but it's international language you can sit in a pub in Ireland or\nOr I suppose in a small concert hall in in Reykjavik and feel like you're celebrating the same thing\nWith local people absolutely and I and I think that's part of what drives K XP and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark sometimes I've been in in traditional music or sessions and Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength ... and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really yeah\nIs is such a great word to describe a when you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music\nSparks sometimes I've been in in traditional music or sessions in Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really yeah\nTransformational is is such a great word to describe a when you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and not\nTell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was I wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called secret rows and they uh had an album called I'll get to ...\nThat\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this music from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listen to some music for Greek if I wanted to go to the fjord and look at the view where his cabinet was when he was inspired to write that you have the music is sometimes\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this Mueller that's from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listen to some music fair\nFor Greek if I wanted to go to the fjord and look at the view where his cabinet was when he was inspired to write that down the music is sometimes so unfair and you want to be translated it and\nYou want to go to the to the place from where it blossomed yes music and sometimes it inside travel okay so you're organizing the snow in the sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yeah so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two

schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his productions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe boat just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more specific\nThere is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats that any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin are two states that were really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if this generation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nI I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrat in both of those states say that\nParts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation would reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have chased a lot of uh\nAbout and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how a democratic tax increases\nHave chased a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nWho are elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way

this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse identity we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on\nAnd the data we can bring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political context I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly castle I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and\nThe grounds so you have to balance it out is the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly gasoline\nI I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road because once you've created as the racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound\nIn our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is a political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings with a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a real concern and identity and and the politics around it has been an ice ... and it certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is in our country today is that where more divided around identities then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing\nDo you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities then we are around policies so that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through

who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nIn in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYes now the question is whether you can do that with ... what you called rightly recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New

schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave at what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nHave said they're just gonna maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nSeats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nI think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years\nThey are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic\nAttacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave chased a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short hair\nA lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before

come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas in a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went

Chris Cuomo on CNN\nWas your name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an angle sized version of it he wasn't the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can over your identity we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people\nSo polarized you said we reached him earlier this week and ask him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse identity and we can bring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political context I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say\nIt may be that the most important

collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly castle\nI I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition
