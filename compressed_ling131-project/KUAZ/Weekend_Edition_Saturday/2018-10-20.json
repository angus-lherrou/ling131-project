of the day the air is filled with countless images which acts as a magnet is that how you feel oh my gosh and\nYou're reminding me I haven't thought about that quote since I wrote the book and I started out intentionally number one I wanted a quote from Leonardo because if you think about really good visual thinkers he's got to be among those on the very top of the stack and I love this idea that you open your eyes in the morning and there is the world just waiting for you\nTo look at and see what you can see and it's so interesting to me because Leonardo he had no choice but to hand draw his images he seemed to do just fine\nHe did great you're referring of course to his various no books that are full of let's think of the things that Leonardo invented right so we had the first

you can see\nEnded so interesting to me because Leonardo he had no choice but to hand draw his images he seemed to do just fine he's he did great you're referring of course to his various no books that are full of\nLet's think of the things that Leonardo invented right so we had the first helicopter drawing on the margins of one of his notebooks\nThe first parachute all of these different kinds of battle men's or an F ... all of his stuff\nOr ... flapping wings machine that's right 'cause he was thinking that we were gonna fly he's he has all of these sketches of birds and flight thinking that maybe because flight which is one of the things I also love about Leonardo how many of these things relate to getting into the air\nHe thought we'd be able to fly like birds that didn't quite work out but the funny thing about the parachute that he sketched out five hundred years ago interestingly enough maybe five or six years ago a Swiss engineer went in and looked at Leonardo sketch in the margins of one of his notebooks and built the parachute as Leonardo had designed it\nAnd was taken up to you know eight thousand feet or something and jumped out of a plane using Leonardo was parachute and lived\n[laughter] ask because they don't know was pretty sharp hand\nBut the funny thing about the parachute that he sketched out five hundred years ago interestingly enough maybe five or six years ago a Swiss engineer went in and looked at Leonardo sketch in the margins of one of his notebooks and built the parachute as Leonardo had designed it\nAnd was taken up to you know eight thousand feet or something and jumped out of a plane using Leonardo was parachute and lived [laughter]\nYou ask because they don't know it was pretty sharp [laughter] and then he had a backup shoot that wasn't designed by Leonardo da Vinci you pay that he would be joining Leonardo [laughter] since ... yeah well\nWhat's so fascinating to me is that when you say it that way how his mind worked had to be visual it had to have all of these elements that he literally saw things\nIt must be so and there's so many other pieces that fit into this because aside from all the things that Leonardo invented so many of which he drew first let's not forget that this is the same mind that also painted the Mona Lisa\nSoftening it must be so and there's so many other pieces that fit into this because aside from all the things that Leonardo invented so many of which he drew first let's not forget that this is the same mind that also painted the Mona Lisa\nYou know it's so funny because these are all new techniques new approaches that are going in parallel with\nThe big data explosion the big analytics explosion but it has nothing to do with technology and a real sense it has to do with our ability to actually put these things together which\nYou were in power now by technology\nWell and this being technician I was thinking it would be lovely to talk with you a little bit about the word you just mentioned data I read recently the statistics and IBM in their global planet report last year publish this information that they estimate Ninety percent of all of the data that is in the world\nKnowledge in a real sense it has to do with our ability to actually put these things together which are in power now by technology\nWell and this being tech nation I was thinking it would be lovely to talk with you a little bit about the word you just mentioned data\nI read recently the statistics and IBM in their global planet report last year publish this information that they estimate Ninety percent of all of the data that is in the world today\nWas generated in the last two years alone Ninety percent of all the recording data in the world today was generated in the last two years according to the idea\nThat I followed up with I haven't had any statistics from the top of my mind\nCisco published a report estimating that something like Ninety five percent of all information conveyed through the Internet is visual information put those two together massive amount of data out there massive amount of visual information why\n'cause data all by itself doesn't mean a lot to us but one we can put it together into a picture and see how all those data points line up and what they illuminate\nAll of the sudden our mind gets happy and one thing I Would love to talk with you a little bit as we go on and this is you've mentioned it already we have data that\nPut those two together massive amount of data out there massive amount of visual information why 'cause data all by itself doesn't mean a lot to us but one we can put it together into a picture and see how all those data points line up and what they illuminate\nAll of the sudden our mind gets happy\nAnd one thing I Would love to talk with you a little bit as we go on and this is you've mentioned it already we have data that leads to data visualization and that's kind of old ... at this point I ... the good doctor tough the starts in Twenty years ago thinking about data visualization and other ... other leaders\nAnd then we started to have kind of uh information visualization coming out probably in the last ten or twelve years with\nCompanies like tap blow and other people that make sophisticated it's not just data analytics now the way I like to break it down is data visualization in my mind typically allows you to take maybe maybe two or three dimensions of data\nAnd map them onto each other and say OK these numbers plus these numbers give me this picture interesting\nI think that information visualization\nDouble or triple that to where you can actually take seven or eight different dimensions of data and map them together into a much more ...\nNow the way I like to break it down is data visualization in my mind typically allows you to take maybe maybe two or three dimensions of data and map the mom to each other and say OK these numbers plus these numbers give me this picture interesting I think that information visualization\nDouble or triple that to where you can actually take seven or eight different dimensions of data and map them together into a much more sophisticated kind of a graphic maybe it includes time maybe it includes\nManipulate all trends you can actually move through it backwards and forwards and add additional data ... now I Would call that information visualization\nAnd wherever you know where we're about to go wire\nKnowledge visual and they're you know we've got data visualization were good now it better information visualization\nLet's be FAIR data is interesting but I don't really want the data I Want the information that comes from the data but even the information isn't that interesting because what I really want is the knowledge that comes from the information I imagine if we had something called knowledge visualization what would that even look like\nI don't know but I Want it now I Want to do too and I think we're chipping away I say we because myself and some friends and colleagues who are you\nInformation visualization let's be FAIR data is interesting but I don't really want the data I Want the information that comes from the data but even the information isn't that interesting because what I really want is that knowledge\nThat comes from the information I imagine if we had something called knowledge visualization what would that even look like\nI don't know but I Want it now I Want to do too and I think we're chipping away I say we because myself and some friends and colleagues who are all visual people or data people or technology people are chipping away at this and what we've done\nAnd this is fun to be able to share with you a little bit\nOne of the things that was really great in going back and writing this new book draw to win ten years after having written the back of the napkin\nWas to go back into the latest science around human visual cognition so many new insights and find number one this is really cool we now pretty much know\nThat vision human vision is a predictable process what I mean by that is if you think about vision the biochemical near a logical physiological\nSystem that's going on in our head converting light into meaning it's the system\nLatest science around human visual cognition so many new insights and find number one this is really cool we now pretty much know\nThat vision human vision is a predictable process what I mean by that is if you think about vision the biochemical near a logical physiological\nSystem that's going on in our head converting light into meaning it's the system and just like the way our heart pump blood or the way that we walk for all people\nThat system works and essentially the same way we'll walk you know we have our own little someone has their own little hitch in there get along kind of walk but for the most part we all walk the same way\nVision is the same for all of us and the beauty of it is when you understand what our visual engine\nOur minds by our visual neocortex are retinas are trying to do with the vast amount of information in front of us\nThey're trying to force it through a series of filters and lenses to draw meaning out and they're doing it in a very specific way and we now know what that weight is which means if there's something I Want to explain to you\nI Do if I could do it visually I Know exactly which pictures your visual mind is hoping to get next which means that I can\nYour cortex or retinas are trying to do with the vast amount of information in front

something I Want to explain to you I Do if I could do it visually I Know exactly which pictures your visual mind is hoping to get next\nWhich means that I can explain anything by creating these very simple pictures in this particular sequence and you and I are going to understand it almost exactly the same way and I think that is we're knowledge visualization is going to come\nFrom [noise] I've always told my students for instance that information is data in context\nAnd Joe data could sit there oh it's meaningless and all of a sudden really important and then all of it goes back to meaning [laughter] [laughter]\nSo there it is I'm really looking forward to information going the knowledge I what's that lead to and we don't quite know it yet but I can see people pushing on it and it is a very important thing today\nThat we be able to take all of this complexity around us and be able to reduce it to pictures people under ...\nData could sit there how it's meaningless and all of a sudden really important and then all of it goes back to meaning [laughter] [laughter]\nSo there is I Am really looking forward to information going the knowledge at once that leap and we don't quite know it yet but I can see people pushing on it and it is a very important thing today\nThat we be able to take all of this complexity around us and be able to reduce it to pictures people understand pictures they're ready to understand pictures\nHow many times if I sat in a meeting and somebody brought out a three inch report with a one page executive summary they didn't even get the executive summary that what does it mean if you can drop picture\nIt makes all the difference in the world to me it's an essential skill today to get worse\nOh it is in fact I Would push it even a little bit further and this is actually something that I talked about in the book truck to when\nI Believe that the conversation today the bigger conversation the global conversation is visual and if you want a business person to be in that conversation you have to be visual too now there are people who say oh my goodness this is terrible this is a loss of verbal literacy\nOh it is in fact I Would push it even a little bit further and this is actually something that I talked about in the book try to win\nI Believe that the conversation today the bigger conversation the global conversation\nIs visual and if you want hate business person to be in that conversation you have to be visual too now there are people who say oh my goodness this is terrible this is a loss of verbal literacy I Do not agree I think on the contrary what's happening is\nThere have only ever been a limited number of people who were really truly effective verbal communicators anyway and it was a very exclusive group and attended some times to exclude people who might not have been as verbal I find that visual thinking is a much\nFaster way for people to be able to actually understand complex concepts and then participate I find it much more democratic way of sharing information because when you draw a picture and there's something that is not understood or factually wrong\nIt's immediately obvious which is not true when you're ... just a ... talking about something words are very very easy to miss ...\nBush faster way for people to be able to actually understand complex concepts and then participate I

created visual memory palaces throughout our house my wife's in real estate someone\nIt's probably seven or eight years ago now that really sort of brought home a real wake and for all of us this notion of the memory palace that if you really want to remember a lot of things what you do is you associate each thing you want to remember to some sort of visual object you place that visual object in a in a palace in your mind\nAnd you will never forget it and so the same thing happens we've created visual memory palaces throughout our house my wife's in real estate someone we are talking

on technician health a new model for going after genetically driven diseases which affect a small number of patients\nFind the scientists wherever they are and build small companies around them then chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft reviews progress in knowing the health status of our hearts [noise]\nIt's not unusual for biotech companies to work on a number of diseases\nAnd breakthroughs science today on technician health a new model for going after genetically driven diseases which affect a small number of patients\nFind the scientists wherever they are and build small companies around them then chief correspondent Dr Daniel craft reviews progress in knowing the health status of our hearts\nIt's not unusual for biotech companies to work on a number of diseases all at the same time but usually they do that work under a single company and then one or at most two different locations\nBridge bile has a different model Neal Kumar is it CEO\nYeah well first of all thanks for having me on and a great pleasure to speak with you we have a slightly different model that allows us to go uniquely after some very small diseases\nAnd so I guess the whole point of any model is to say okay what science do we find interesting in this case it's the science behind genetic disease\nAnd then how do we actually go after it and it can't be by building a normal biotech because of normal biotech as twenty to twenty five people and labs and a whole bunch of fixed costs that they carry on and that is too expensive to go after a patient population of a couple of hundred patients let's say or a couple of thousand patients\nIt was to go uniquely after some very small diseases\nAnd so I guess the whole point of any model is to say okay what science do we find interesting in this case it's there's science behind genetic disease\nAnd then how do we actually go after it and it can't be by building a normal biotech because of normal biotech has twenty to twenty five people and labs and a whole bunch of fixed costs that they carry on and it's too expensive to go after a patient population of a couple of hundred patients let's say or a couple of thousand patients\nAnd so we have a model that effectively variable I there's a lot of those fixed costs we have a central platform and then every time we fight an interesting project we start a new company but that new company only has a few scientists that really understand that space within it\nAnd they can draw from June a functions or generalized R and D functions from bridge by farmer and then come back when they're done so it tends to lead to much more capital efficiency\nEr which then in turn allows us to go after small things\nAnd so we have bridge bio that's the sort of the parent company out if you will is right and every time you come up with something new new company does write a company that bridge by has like okay who needs pencils\nProbably probably a little bigger than that [laughter] we're in and out of the day you know but uh but the sun\nIt tends to lead to much more capital efficiency a which then in turn allows us to go after small things\nAnd so we have bridge bio that's the sort of the parent company ... if you will that's right and every time you come up with something new new company does write a company that bridge by has like okay who needs pencils\n[laughter] probably [laughter] I'm a little bigger than that [laughter] we're in and out that's on Sunday Now but uh but\nThe science of courses at the core of each of these projects why it a different different set of scientists have to be there give us some examples of the the genetically driven diseases you're working on\nSo I mean what we we think about these diseases in three different categories really are the first or the classic inherited diseases like you hear about Tay Sachs or sickle cell\nA we have a number of programs in these sorts of areas ... doses Carlin syndrome you may not have heard of each one of these ... way they are about twenty five million Americans so those those are what we think allows me daily and disease\nThen there's a series of water called germ line cancers there's also inherited diseases or pediatric cancers which more people have heard of\nWe break them out separately because there's more of awareness around pediatric cancer or and then there are what we call ...\nWe have a number of programs in these sorts of areas ... doses Carlin syndrome you may not have heard of each one of these ... way they are about twenty five million Americans so those those are what we think allows me daily and disease\nThen there's a series of water called germ line cancers there's also inherited diseases or pediatric cancers which more people have heard of\nWe break them out separately because there's more of awareness around pediatric cancer\nAnd then there are what we call ... cancers which developed later in life these can be any sort of cancer a lot of what like walk so pharmaceuticals and others are going after these cancers that arise where there is a very clear genetic driver\nSo what what sort of binds all of these programs together is that you can from mutation really precisely understand what's driving the disease\nSo it's not like heart failure diabetes where there are a lot of different things going on there's the genetics there's your diet there's you know all sorts of different he's asked for banning factors these are very clearly quantitatively driven by the mutation and that's what we focus on\nI guess one of my question says do you have the house in different places I mean this but he has a different color named tad had him there and if you only have a couple of scientists here and a couple of scientists there\nSo we we think are a lot about okay\nWhere there are a lot of different things going on there's the genetics there's your diet there's you know all sorts of different he's asked for banning factors these are very clearly quantitatively driven by the mutation and that's what we focus on\nI guess one of my question says do you have the house in different places I mean there's [noise] but he has a different color named tad had him there and if you only have a couple of scientists ear and a couple of scientists there\nSo we we think are a lot about okay who are the people that really need to be part of the company and it's usually the people that\nHave wanted to peanut dives one is that they really deeply understand the biology and typically those people are coming from an academic lab that have been looking at ... for Twenty years Thirty years sometimes\nAnd so we go to where those people are so we have subsidiaries in Memphis in Montreal in Paris and San Francisco of course in Boston says where the science and it's where it's where those it's where the science of where the experts are\nAnd we try to set up around them and then the second type of person that's a really important to us or people that understand the clinical manifestations of the disease and can help with development\nAnd so in many cases will locate around them especially if it's later stage program so yeah I mean we're basically geographically young constrained 'em and\nIn Montreal in Paris and San Francisco of course in Boston this where the science and it's where it's where those it's where the science of where the experts are and we try to set up around them and then the second type of person that's really important to us are people that understand the clinical manifestations of the disease and can help with development\nAnd so in many cases will locate around them especially if it's later stage program so yeah I mean we're basically geographical young constrained\nUm and but what we've done a lot in our backyard and San Francisco just because you know we're there [laughter]\nAnd it's a pretty large uh ... yeah right [laughter]\nNow here's another interesting now I expected when I read your bio to find a life scientist a light on science executive all year degrees or in chemical engineering what's up with that you're not that they were these appeals to what's going on\nWhile you're an engineer as they see you know that I'd have to let you go [laughter] I I think\nThat uh so I I actually under chemical engineering at a very interesting period of time because the traditional and maybe some of my professors would would kill me for saying this but my my perception was the traditional chemical engineering disciplines were dying like oil and gas plastics where all of us use to go\nWhat's up with that you're not that they were these ... what's going on while you're an engineer as they see you know that I [laughter] I I think that ah so I I actually\nUnder chemical engineering at a very interesting period of time because the traditional\nAnd maybe some of my professors would would kill me for saying this but\nI my my perception was the traditional chemical engineering disciplines were dying like oil and gas plastics where all of us use to go separations things like that\nThere wasn't there's not a ton of research going on there are a lot of the really important problems that are already been solved\nSo when I entered chemical engineering a lot of new research was going on in the by biotechnology industry in fact a lot of the early folks associated with Jen diamond Jeanette attack and you know the whole thing of manufacturing these new types of modalities there were chemical engineers\nAnd a lot of the faculty at Stanford and MIT ride trains were actually in biotech and in some of those early\nDays so I did all my research at the corner of biology and chemical engineering at my PHD or wasn't cancer signaling so so it's kind of yeah chemical engineering has changed life\nScience now that that way [laughter] ... exactly engineering building in life but I Do that [laughter]\nThere were chemical engineers and a lot of the faculty at Stanford and MIT ride trains were actually in biotech and in some of those early days so I did all my research at the corner of biology and chemical engineering and my PHD or wasn't cancer signaling so so it's kind of you know when you're hearing is changed life\nScience now that that way [laughter] along exile engineering building in life but I Do that [laughter] yeah\nSo you know I mean I think there's a discipline now called of biological engineering that didn't exist when I was in school but it really is um [noise] yeah it's a ... I mean it it's at the corner of a lot of engineering disciplines and biology but certainly there are some chemical engineering biology intersection there\nI mean we we as so many times we forget that we've got you know will pay all this organic matter and really look at our brain and then we have all the the electrical signals than we have we have and the street and there and it's like all of these things are working together we had them broken up into separate silos\nYeah it's kinda interesting you say that because I mean for me engineering is sort of like this uh this way of simplifying very complex problems and there is no more complex will problem than a biology and then putting some quantitative real rules around it and so you know if you think about a cell for instance\nLook at our brain and then we have all the these electrical signals that we have we have and history and there and it's like all of these things are working together we had them broken up into separate silos\nHe has kind of interesting you say that because I mean for me engineering is sort of like this uh this way of simplifying very complex problems and there is no more complex will problem than\nA biology and then putting some quantitative real rules around it and so you know if you think about a cell for instance you think about it sitting in an extracellular meal meal you it's interrogating all that information then there are all these signals going through the cell and then it decides to do something like\n... parade or migrate or do something like that and you ask yourself OK so a biologist or reduction area scientists would look to build up a set of data and understand how all of those steps happen that's really hard\nAnd so an engineer kind of abstraction says a little bit like okay I'm going like there's a there's a cue there's a signal there is a response to this is kind of what you know\nThe law firm broke at MIT has been talking about and you put it that altogether and how do I model it and how do I start to get some predict of understanding of how this might change for drug intervened or you know if I intervened at the at the output level and so that I think engineering is kind of uniquely suited to answer some of these questions not not all of them but some of them\nHe should work at NASA that's for this\nAnd so an engineer kind of abstraction says a

because you had to wear a lot of different factors to me [noise] [noise]\nYeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three during the surgery we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child has been on a waiting list for and live a diner for three times the average\nAnd the child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat are the parents children [noise] so the parents\nHIV but the other thing we had to

Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote sending Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it

know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted\nSo if I from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in a normal life\nThen that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people\nCan do this

down gun Jay was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with presidents first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious to Mr showed jihad died or in their custody he at the at the embassy and at least in both\nThe president was asked about it will tour in an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big said a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\nOf a lot of people Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic well he he took questions from reporters at a round table\nIn their custody he at the at the embassy and placed on both the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the showed used at the unacceptable\nBut also right away scot pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment where the hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nSay the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given how quickly in the past he has leveled\nVery blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV covered\nSyria's hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV

exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that or was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saturday\nA explanation by the president of how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure\nInvestigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to\nOf right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our
