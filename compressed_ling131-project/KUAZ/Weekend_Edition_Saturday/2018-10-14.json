slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from

... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills
