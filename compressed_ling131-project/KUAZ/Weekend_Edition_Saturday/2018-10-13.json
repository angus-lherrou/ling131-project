of everything reminded me that I often ask people from students to academics to business people what's the value exchange here and right away they think I'm asking exclusively about money\nWhat I argue in my book is precisely that [laughter] which is we unfortunately have confused value with prices and first of all this recent this hasn't always been the case in economics class\nLiu of everything reminded me that I often ask people from students to academics to business people what's the value exchange here and right away they think I'm asking exclusively about money\nWhat I argue in my book is precisely that [laughter] which is we unfortunately have confused value with prices\nAnd first of all this recent this hasn't always been the case in economics a classical economists actually focus first on value and they tied at two objective conditions of production just think back to Adam Smith the focus on the division of labor\nUm the pin factory example that he had where you know when you just have one person making every bit of the pin it takes this amount of time and you have lots of different people who are specialized who are producing that object I'm with the increase division of labor that increases productivity which is a key driver growth which is a key driver of the wealth of nations\nAnd also Karl Marx focus a lot on mechanization transformation of production innovation what she thought was a key attributes of capitalism versus futile Islam\nAnd both of these kind of folk guy on objective conditions then turned into their understanding of how exchange occurred so first they had a theory of value and that transformed into a theory of price what we have today\nWith the increase division of labor that increases productivity which is a key driver growth which is a key driver of the wealth of nations\nAnd also Karl Marx focused a lot on mechanization transformation of production innovation what she thought was a key attributes of capitalism versus futile ism\nAnd both of these kind of folk guy on objective conditions then turned into their understanding of how exchange occurred so first they had a theory of value and that transformed into a theory of price what we have today we focus on\nPrices we focus on an exchange and think that somehow that reveals value and so you have this absurd situation where someone like Lloyd Blankfein ... the CEO of Goldman Sachs one year after the crisis\nTwo thousand nine after Laymon went bust\nHe had the nerve to say with a straight face Goldman Sachs workers are the most productive in the world\nAnd you could say that because it's true how we actually measure value based on prices if they are the ones who are paid the most [laughter] that the price of their labor that must actually reveal their value\nI'm fascinated by the fact that you say this is recent that price determines value is a recent concept\nSo I focus on the way that economists have thought about this so I don't go into value in terms of\nIn the world and you could say that because it's true how we actually measure value based on prices if they are the ones who are paid the most [laughter] that's the price of their labor that must actually reveal their value\nI'm fascinated by the fact that you say this is recent that price determines value is a recent concept\nSo I focus on the way that economists have thought about this so I don't go into value in terms of the ethics and the morality behind that that's really my subjects were philosophers and I'm very interested in that but that's definitely not my\nArea I focus on the way that economists themselves have thought about value and that has absolutely changed over the last four hundred years [laughter]\nAnd ah we shouldn't forget that economists have huge power unfortunately over how policymakers thick\nSo canes once said John Maynard Keynes that practitioners on the ground who think they're just doing things useful actually slaves of defunct economic theory so I Try to unveil the defunct economic theory which is informing practical\nSo ... once said John Maynard Keynes that practitioners on the ground who think they're just doing things useful actually slaves of defunct economic theory so I Try to unveil the defunct economic theory which is informing practical\nOr think of cylinder was a was a failure but there were ... it was a solar company that does the Obama government actually invested in gave it a five hundred million guaranteed loans and it failed\nOr just like other you know a investments it's made have actually succeeded Tesla was actually also government financed initially with an equivalent size alone just under five hundred million\nAnd so the government itself for every Tesla probably will have to bear with two or three cylinder as for every Internet might have to bear with two or three Concord planes which today are seen as failures 'cause they're not flying\nOn and so of course the government has no guaranteed rate of return it's also a risk taker workers are also risk takers they might accept a job thinking that they'll have a lifetime career and maybe except to have a lower

as for every Internet might have to bear with two or three Concord planes which today are seen as failures 'cause they're not flying\nOn and so of course the government has no guaranteed rate of return it's also a risk taker workers are also risk takers they might accept a job thinking that they'll have a lifetime career and maybe except to have a lower salary than they would like because they think they will rise up through the ranks there's no guarantee for that\nRight so you actually have different types of risk takers different types of value craters and these companies and unless we have a real from understanding of how value is created collectively by different stakeholders\nThen we end up with these problematic ideas about shareholders being the only risk takers the only value craters and what you get is the justification for the profits and the revenues of these companies to basically be siphoned off\nTo a narrow group of doctors who have been part of the process but not the only ones\nAnd that breeds inequality\nYou're listening to tech nation I more again in my guest today is Mariano much Cato detrimental to cut it\nHolder as being the only risk takers the only value craters and what you get is the justification for the profits and the revenues of these companies to basically be siphoned off\nTo a narrow group of actors who have been part of the process but not the only ones and that reason equality\nYou're listening to tech nation I more again in my guest today is Mariano lots of Cato Dr ... is a professor and the economics of innovation and public value at University College London where she directs the Institute for innovation and public purpose she's here today with her book\nThe value of everything making and taking in the global economy\nYou talk a lot about the difference between value creation and value extraction let's put that we've been touching on it but let's put some simple words to those so that when people see something they can see the difference\nSo first I Would take away any normative judgment on whether what we're talking about as good or bad you know you could even be talking about fracking which some people think is that the forget whether we like what's being finance but value creation is basically the\nAnd value extraction let's put that we've been touching on it but let's put some simple words to those so that when people see something they can see the difference\nSo first I Would take away any normative judgment on whether what we're talking about as good or bad you know you could even be talking about fracking which some people think [laughter] is that the forget whether we like what's being finance but value creation is basically\nThe use of time and effort energy to create basically new\nAnd or improved goods and services which would include public services new types of health care and ... you know better education\nValue extraction is moving around existing\nAssets existing goods and services and basically charging money for like a troll under a bridge just across the bridge they get a fee what has a troll done nothing Adam Smith called this theft he said that the landlords of the time who were really seen as the the key kind of a value extract ers were thieves\nAnd now that would be a bit of a static definition though right as though you really just how one actor who's creating value and one is extracting value the next step is really to say whether the proportion of rewards that are being earned whether it's by the tech companies the lord\nThe bridge to get a fee what has a troll done nothing Adam Smith called this theft he said that the landlords of the time who were really seen as the the key kind of a value extract or is receives\nA now that would be a bit of a static definition though right as though you really just how one\nActor who's creating value and one is extracting value the next step is really to say whether the proportion of rewards that are being earned whether it's by the tech companies the large banks hedge funds is proportional to what they've actually done\nSo it's not to say that said the banks aren't doing anything they might have a very important role in the value creation process for example financing being you know a enabling certain companies to receive the kind of finance they might need to take off\nIn the market but is there returned being burnt by said the investment banks or those who are creating hedge funds or\nThe metro capitalist themselves as we're speaking in San Francisco today\nGetting a reward that is disproportionate to what they've actually done and if you don't have a deep understanding of the different collective actors who contributed to well there's a really strong possibility that we then allow this narrow group of doctors to disproportionately earn\nBeing burnt by said the investment banks or those who are creating hedge funds or the metro capitalist themselves as we're speaking in San Francisco today are\nGetting a reward that is disproportionate to what they've actually done and if you don't have a deep understanding of the different collective actors who contributed to well there is a really strong possibility that we then allow\nThis narrow group of doctors to disproportionately earn and get these massive cash piles as for example we've definitely seen the tech community\nCompared to what they've actually done so in other words what we have is a problem with the story telling behind the success of many of these companies we tell only one part of the story we even you know with all the ... the role of entrepreneurs whether it's Steve Jobs ... mosque and if we're not telling the full story\nAnd an economic theory isn't able to tell the full story\nOf all the different actors including the public actors including the labor force which actually contributed to the success of these very wealthy companies then we're going to have a huge problem in making sure that the wealth that's created is shared just as much as the value was created require different types of actors taking risks\nNow are you do talk about a Silicon Valley\n... and if economic theory isn't able to tell the full story of all the different actors including the public actors including the labor force which actually contributed to the success\nOf these very wealthy companies then we're going to have a huge problem and making sure that the wealth that's created is shared just as much as the value was created require different types of actors taking risks\nNow uh you do talk about a Silicon Valley you talked about Wall Street and you talk about big pharma pharmaceuticals we know that the drug manufacturing portion obeys the laws of technology it gets better faster cheaper\nRecognizing this you're proposing a new economic model so that we can develop pharmaceuticals and we can not only move the value around two creators and the people who are actually making all this\nBut we can also delivered the pharmaceuticals to the people who need them at an inappropriate cost it let's just talk about that model\nWe actually have a report that's coming out in a couple of weeks are funded by the open society foundation which actually proposes exactly how to do that we call it a mission oriented health innovation model what is the challenge actually why do we have all this government money going into a process\nWell you around two creators and the people who are actually making all this\nBut we can also delivered the pharmaceuticals to the people who need them at an inappropriate cost it let's just talk about that model sure we actually have a report that's coming out in a couple of weeks are funded by the open society foundation which actually proposes exactly how to do that we call it a mission oriented health innovation model\nWhat is the challenge actually why do we have all this government money going into a process without actually\nAdequately and strategically thinking about what is it that were actually financing what kind of health care system you could consider from a public actor's point of view which is not trying to maximize profits but trying to maximize public and social value that you would have to have a strong idea\nOf what are the characteristics of the health system that you want to be guiding these different types of public and private investments\nRight so that is often missing and I would call that the sort of directional push what is the mission what are we really trying to do what are we really trying to do here and you can bring in the private sector which of course we'll experiment and explore with you but perhaps it might be better to do it through say a price system\nThat you could say look we really need to find a solution to these kinds of diseases here's a prize this amount of money for those companies that actually come up with a solution\nDifferent types of public and private investments right so that is often missing and I would call that the sort of directional push what is the mission what are we really trying to do what are we really trying to do here and you can bring in the private sector which of course we'll experiment and explore with you but perhaps it might be better to do it through say a price system\nThat you could say look we really need to find a solution to these kinds of diseases here's a prize this amount of money for those companies that actually come up with a solution\nVersus putting in all the money and then allowing the price system itself\nThe prices of the drugs to be the way that we incentivize\nThe pharmaceutical companies to enter that space 'cause then what you get as what we saw where the c._e._o. of a pharmaceutical company called nostrum pharmaceuticals increased the price of an antibiotic by four hundred percent\nAnd antibiotics are essential Madison's when he was asked how can you do this how can you increase the price of such an essential drug that people will require to live by four hundred percent he said I had a moral imperative\nTo do that in order to please my shareholders and so the question is you know if we are going to allow a pharmaceutical industry to do that then there shouldn't be any public funds going into it if you want to allow the pilot pharmaceutical industry to be producing these drugs and to be setting any price they want literally\nAnd I ... or central Madison's when he was asked how can you do this how can you increase the price of such an essential drug that people will require to live by four hundred percent he said I had a moral imperative\nTo do that in order to please my shareholders\nAnd so the question is you know if we are going to allow a pharmaceutical industry to do that then there shouldn't be any public funds going into it if you want to allow the pilot pharmaceutical industry to be producing these drugs and to be setting any price they want literally\nWhat the market will bear then why are we putting public money into it if you are going to be putting public money into it and then the U.S we spent over thirty billion dollars a year\nBy the national institutes of health\nOn pharmaceutical and biotech research then of course both the characteristics of how the health system if you want is being shaped\nBut also of course the prices of the drugs should reflect that public contribution so you know the taxpayers paying two or three different times they're paying for the research they're paying for these very high prices and they're also paying for different types of welfare state institutions to come in and subsidize\nThose uh drugs for the private pharmaceutical companies you know Medicare Medicaid here or in the u._k. where I live the national health service\nAnd it's just a very inefficient system and it hurts both the rate of innovation because there's lots of ways\nOf the drugs should reflect that public contribution so you know the taxpayers paying two or three different times they're paying for the research they're paying for these very high prices and they're also paying for different types of

service\nAnd it's just a very inefficient system and it hurts both the rate of the nation because there's lots of waste but also the direction of innovation innovation has not just a rape but a direction\nDr Mariano ... is a professor in the economics of innovation and public value at University College London where she directs the Institute for innovation in public purpose we'll talk more after a break\n... passive technician in technician health are available at NPR One I tend to church and\nTime cancer technician in technician health are available at NPR One I tend to church and other ... can't syndication outlet coming up and the second half of our show on technician health\nKim Shannon from Ken in partners explained some new interest in the cutting edge as medical technology\nAnd she's correspondent Dr Daniel craft\nDescribes recent approval in any uh from the FTA stay with [noise]\nSo I think we always go on to the size wide open um I think we understand patients problems you know I think science over the past decades has gotten better convoluted those problems I think the biggest breakthrough there's been around understanding human biology rather than an animal biology\nSo gun industry spent the longtime an animal models of of disease and we still use those but what really I think is transformed our abilities are human genetics you know really the found\nThis eyes wide open um I think we understand patients problems you know I think science over the past decades has gotten better at the convoluted those problems I think the biggest breakthrough there has been around understanding human biology rather than animal biology\nSo gun industry spent a long time in animal models of of disease and we still use those but what really I think is transformed or abilities are human genetics you know really the foundation's being in the human genome project\nWhich unfold in about Twenty years ago and then the knowledge just come from\nThe human genes impacting disease sex is real strong validation of what's wrong in the disease much better notion of what's wrong disease than we had pre genetics\nNot let us know where to go so it increases the likelihood of us being able to target a real important part of the patients disease and impact diseases are going to a successful it to me that's a real big change you know over the past Twenty years and the way we approach developing drugs for a ...\nOne thing that I've noticed is that used to be like one disease suddenly becomes multiple variations on a theme and then within that multiple variations on I think the whole number of diseases you could have has expanded magnificently\nOf us being able to target a real important part of the patients disease an impact is going to successfully to me that's a real big change over the past Twenty years in the way we approach developing drugs for a ... is\nOne thing that I've noticed is that used to be like one disease suddenly becomes multiple variations on a theme and then within that multiple variations on a theme [noise] the whole number of diseases you could have has expanded magnificently before I\nAnd and and they're all smaller because of that so one diseases become thousands diseases and the you know the prime example is cancer we talk about cancer that's one word it's\nUm five or six letter six letters I guess but boy it's a lot of different things so again I think part of our limitations are one with we simplify things and we simplify things like cancer and we've done that historically because we didn't have really a strong underlined understanding of of the complexity of diseases\nAnd again we really have scientifically broken diseases down into much smaller entities but much more specific entities where again you know this the whole idea behind precision medicine which you can really understand a particular type of cancer in particular patient you can treat that cancer very well may not have helped\nAnd we simplify things like cancer and we've done that historically because we didn't have really a strong underlined understanding of of the complexities of diseases\nAnd again we really have scientifically broken diseases down into much smaller entities but much more specific entities where again you know this the whole idea behind precision medicine\nWhere if you can really understand a particular type of cancer in particular patient you can treat that cancer very well may not have helped all cancer patients but that's a population of patients you can really targeting really have a big impact and that's really been again a big change\nOver the past twenty or Thirty years and that will continue um is this whole trend toward personalized medicine personalized therapies will be a really strong going forward\nWell since I have you in front of me I Want to ask you a couple of ... bats a couple of terms I'd been hearing capital concepts had been hearing one focus has been a protein degradation tell us about that yeah\nNo that's that's a religious that's a whole new type of drug I'm so just to take a step back most of the drugs that have been developed are things we call inhibitors of proteins so their drugs that many proteins bind a thing called a leg in and they changed\n... that's a couple of terms I'd been hearing capital concepts had been hearing one focus has been a protein degradation ... yeah\nNo that's that's a religion so that's a whole new type of drug I'm so just to take a step back most of the drugs that have been developed are things we call inhibitors of proteins\nSo their drugs that many proteins bind a thing called a leg in and they changed that lying into something else that's what an enzyme does it takes one thing and changed something else\nSo most of our drugs that have been developed so far as things that blocks the activity that enzyme and they usually do by mimicking the substrate usually convert so they gum up the engine of that\nWe've got very good at that but the problem is there are only so many enzymes to drug there are very small portion of all the disease targets protein degradation is a different approach\nSo you all you need with protein degradation you don't need to block up a function you you just need to tag up a protein and you trick the cell into chewing up that protein and getting rid of it\nSo getting the cells have a normal mechanism to a quality control proteins within it and it that Mac and he pointed that protein you want to hear it right so the cell usually does that has its own ...\nTargets putting degradation is a different approach so you all you need with protein degradation you don't need to block up a function you you just need to tag up a protein and you trick the cell into chewing up that protein and getting rid of it\nSo getting the cells have a normal mechanism to a quality control proteins within it and it that ...\nPoint kid that protein you want to hear it\nRight so the cell usually does that has its own ... system if you will it's called the ... film\nAnd protein degradation tricks to sell into thinking it should get rid of something that it otherwise wouldn't get rid of so now if you have something causing cancer you can use a drug to trick that cell into degrading that thing that's causing cancer\nSo you can go after a whole different class of protein targets and things like cancer and other diseases\nAnd get rid of them and deal with them in ways that traditional drugs haven't been able to do so it opens a whole new field and all you can go after a whole different set of inter cellular targets with that\nI mean in the past have gone over the whole cell because he knew the protein is there ... ... you don't have to do right\nThis this is a way to very specifically go after a particular protein that's causing the patients disease and just trick this\nIt's an and things like cancer and other diseases and get rid of them and deal with them in ways that traditional drugs haven't been able to do so it opens a whole new field and all you can go after a whole different set of inter cellular targets with that\nI mean in the past have gone over the whole cell because he knew the protein is they're just lay it ... you don't have to do right\nSo this this is a way to very specifically go after a particular protein that's causing the patients disease and just trick the cell and getting rid of it through its own mechanisms of of of chewing up proteins\nSo now for your next term you're doing very well at that they have nothing to give you they started with sight okay probably have a nice tell bag my actually my ... but that's that's all we can get what is synthetic lethality\nVery interesting concept so again this this gets back into taking advantage of the kill the heels of cancer cells\nSo I think is you know cancer cells come about through mutations and they developed lots of them so those are changes in DNA that result in changes in proteins and some of those proteins become hyperactive and Dr cancer cells but a lot of the mutations don't have any function they just create proteins that are non functional\nThose non functional um proteins can cause a stress on the cell and again the cell\nTaking advantage of the kill the heels of cancer cells\nSo I think he's you know cancer cells come about through mutations and they developed lots of them so those are changes in DNA that result in changes and proteins and some of those proteins become hyperactive and Dr cancer cells but a lot of the mutations don't have any function they just create proteins that are non functional\nThose non functional um proteins can cause a stress on the cell and again the cell has to get rid of those they can also causes stress on the DNA so for years cancer cells to divide your DNA has to be intact and when these mutations occur in DNA that causes stress\nThe cells again have a normal system the repairs DNA that has been your normal cells your cancer cells rely on that because they have so many abnormalities DNA if they don't have this repair mechanism tack they'll insect die\nSo synthetic lethality is a situation where\nA patient has a certain mutations that then you take a drug and you literally block DNA repair it in that sell so that it can no longer to deal with mutation load in those cancer cells in the cancer cells will die because it pushes them over and too stressful situation so it's actually\nMany abnormalities DNA if they don't have this repair mechanism tack they'll insect die\nSo synthetic Lee Sally is a situation where\nA patient has a certain mutations that then you take a drug and you literally block DNA repair it in that sell so that it can no longer to deal with mutation load in those cancer cells and the cancer cells will die because it pushes them over to stressful situations\nSo it's actually taking advantage of mutations that a cancer cell to tip a cancer cell over into a death passed away 'cause they can't deal with this mutation say you want to mutate we'll help yeah right exactly so it's playing right into what the cancer cell does better overload that\nAnd it can't deal with the ... cancer cells right a very fine line and this just tips them over where they actually can't survive because there's too much mutation all of\nThat the last one I Want to ask you about I don't have a term for that it's a it's a new uh it's something new and cystic fibrosis remind us what cystic fibrosis says and I think you know what I'm Talking about it's OK\nSo against us fibrosis is a disease I'm you know it starts at birth and um it's a disease of the lungs predominantly also affects them\nWhere where they actually can't survive because there's too much ... now the last one I Want to ask you about I don't have a term for that it's a it's a new a new in cystic fibrosis remind us what cystic fibrosis says I think you know what I'm Talking about [laughter]\nSo against ... is a disease I'm you know it starts at birth and um it's a disease of the lungs predominantly also affects some ... other organs but the lungs are really like get people into trouble\nSo it's a disease and something called a a a protein in a cell that transports chloride into your airway\nSo your airways airs going in and out of your breathing tubes nose breathing tubes are lined with mucus and things called silly at which are little hairs and the mucus catches things they're going into your lungs and the silly helps pushing back out of your lungs so bacteria

controversial process here called\nMatch which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have there is just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote
