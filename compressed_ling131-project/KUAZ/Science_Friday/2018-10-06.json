A. dot O. R. G. it's six o'clock oh\nWelcome to the bus I'm Christopher Connelly on today's show will get an overview of local policing and how law enforcement agencies work together\nI think there is a sense that everybody kind of lives in metro Tucson and they're\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategies of intervention for example around domestic violence we're doing\nLot of work to talk to the victims of TV and get a sense of\nWhat the perpetrator is like and what the likelihood of a lethal encounter going forward right my beep\nAnd then you have the chance to do different kinds of intervention with them that can reduce the likelihood of a of a murderer a serious assault going forward and we're seeing what we hope is some success with that\nBut you know that's part of the challenge right you don't know what things you're doing that are potentially preventing homicides you know on a homicide occur is and you try to look back and say well what might we do differently was there a point of intervention but\nA lot of the homicides we're seeing right now are really fights between people where somebody had a gun off and there was alcohol or drugs that were on board\nThat kind of thing it's hard to intervene so the areas where we're trying to do more are around gang violence where perhaps with the right kind of information gathering and different sorts of intervention you can maybe prevent some of those it's a it's a tough area to analyze and\nAre really fights between people where somebody had a gun off and there was alcohol or drugs that were on board\nThat kind of thing it's hard to intervene so the areas where we're trying to do more are around gang violence where perhaps with the right kind of information gathering and different sorts of intervention\nYou can maybe prevent some of those it's a it's a tough area to analyze and figure out what the right thing is and and how to do at best\nTucson police department has a very high sulfur rate just good police work I guess\nI think a combination of things that is an unusually high rate of solving homicides but\nReally there's no community I've ever heard of where police can just do that on the ground I think we have terrific detectives they work unbelievably hard and often somebody's really serious crimes come in groups and so it's not like they just conveniently spaced out over the year\nOur detectors you really are put through the ringer because you can have you know a homicide one night and then when two nights later and then when the next day and that's\nYou know that that's really tough site they are fantastic they are persistent they're resilient they're very very smart\nTerrific detectives they were unbelievably hard and often somebody's really serious crimes come in groups and so it's not like they just conveniently spaced out over the year\nArchitect has really put through the ringer because you can have you know a homicide one night and then one two nights later and then when the next day and that's\nYou know that that's really tough site they are fantastic they are persistent they're resilient they're very very smart\nBut even with the best detective you really need a community that is willing to come forward with information almost all of these solves\nHave some component of community involvement and so a lot of it is tips that we get through eighty eight crime or people calling the police department or even people knowing the officer that works in their area stopping them and saying I heard this or I have some information about that so\nI I really credited to the willingness of the community to come forward and work with us as much as I give credit obviously do great police worked at the detectives an officer doing\nTalking about that community aspects that speaks to trust how do you build trust in in in a police agency not everybody trust the police\nIn their area stopping them and saying I heard that drives some information about that so I I really credited to the willingness of the community to come forward and work with us as much as I give credit obviously the great police worked at the detectives an officer doing\nTalking about that community aspect that speaks to trust how do you build trust in and in a police agency not everybody trust the police\nRight that is an ongoing challenge because some of the people we need to have that trust with the most in some cases may be the least likely for a whole host of reasons not to be so trustworthy\nWe know there's a history between law enforcement and for example communities of color throughout the country that's based on a history that's not very good and so\nYou know you can't just ask people to put that aside I have a lot of officers particularly younger officers who say well I don't understand this I'm I really am working hard to treat people fairly I treat everybody courteous lady I Want to have good interactions with people from all different neighborhoods and backgrounds [noise]\nWhat's the problem here and we have to help them understand that some of this is historical it may be\nBased on the history that's not very good and so\nYou know you can't just ask people to put that aside I have a lot of officers particularly younger officers who say well I don't understand this I'm I really am working hard to treat people fairly I treat everybody courteous lately I want to have good interactions with people from all different neighborhoods and backgrounds [noise]\nWhat's the problem here and we have to help them understand that some of this is historical it may be experiences that people had many years ago and that their family had or it could be people who dealt with police and other communities where they really weren't treated badly\nSo you can't just you can't discount any of that but what we try to do is build bridges moving forward we are out\nIn every neighborhood in Tucson we try to provide service that is high quality and build relationships that are based on trust\n'em throughout the entire city where at neighborhood meetings were engaged in talking to people we get it that trust is something that's that takes time to build and can be easily dismantled by an incident that people don't understand why it happened or what's going on\nSo we also are working to have a more diverse police department and I I think we're making\nThe and build relationships that are based on trust\n'em throughout the entire city where at neighborhood meetings were engaged in talking to people we get it that trust is something that's that takes time to build and can be easily dismantled by an incident that people don't understand why it happened or what's going on\nSo we also are working to have a more diverse police department and I I think we're making progress across the board but good community policing\nReally has to be based on relationships\nWe've seen a lot of attention over the last year or so especially with the NFL protests and things like that about [noise]\nDifficult relationships between police and ... and communities of color has that changed the wait T. P. D. has operated in recent times is this is becoming more and more part of a national conversation\nYou know what I find interesting is that even though I'm a lot of the national narrative Israeli around areas of distrust in conflict especially when it comes to race we've worked really hard at ground level to build trust and\nI think that pays off because then when something happen\nT. P. D. has operated in recent times is this is becoming more and more part of a national conversation\nYou know what I find interesting is that even though I'm a lot of the national narrative Israeli around areas of distrust in conflict especially when it comes to race we've worked really hard at ground level to build trust and\nI think that pays off because then when something happens where people\nReally wonder is there a racial component or how upset should we be about you know something that they see that may have occurred maybe an officer involved shooting or any number of things\nI I think we are at a better place than I knock on wood with people being a little more patient a little more willing to actually talk to us about what's going on before they jump to an immediate conclusion they still may not be happy with us I'm not saying everything's perfect but I Do think\nHaving those relationships you know I talked to people and and residents of all of all backgrounds all races and what I like hearing is you know them describing I Know officer so and so I Know you know lieutenant selling so who I see it\nAbout what's going on before they jump to an immediate conclusion they still may not be happy with us I'm not saying everything's perfect but I Do think\nHaving those relationships you know I talked to people and and residents of all of all backgrounds all races and what I like hearing is\nYou know them describing I Know officer so and so I Know you know lieutenant selling so who I see at our meetings or who I can talk to about this and that it's\nThat's powerful and I think that really puts us in a place that perhaps is better than a lot of communities even our size or certainly larger where\nThose relationships are really strained\nWe're talking with chief magnets at the Tucson police department you mentioned trying to get the police force here more diverse in years past we've had a shortage of officers how are we doing on staffing numbers in Tucson\nWell I'm not satisfied with where we're at um staffing numbers actually a much lower than we'd like them to be you know we try to look at the numbers in an honest and straightforward way because the numbers are what they are and we have to deal with them I think\nTrying to get the police force here ... more diverse in years past we've had a shortage of officers how are we doing on staffing numbers and Tucson\nWell I'm not satisfied with where we're at um a staffing numbers actually are much lower than we'd like them to be\nYou know we try to look at the numbers in an honest and straightforward way because the numbers are what they are and we have to deal with them I think honestly rather than playing games with them we have right now\nI'm roughly eight hundred officers who we who considered ... deployable they can actually they don't need ... coach there not and training eight hundred fully deploy ... sworn people now that doesn't mean eight hundred that are\nAll out on the road taking calls that includes detective ... includes supervisors it includes folks and special units ... administrators the whole nine yards [noise]\nBut then we have another give or take sixty officers who are in what we call the training pipeline and so that gives us roughly eight hundred and sixty some sworn personnel\nBut we need more than that and we're working really hard we have a group of twenty four in an academy right now and the other\nDoes that include supervisors it includes folks and special units administrators the whole nine yards [noise]\nBut then we have another give or take sixty officers who are in what we call the training pipeline and so that gives us roughly eight hundred and sixty some sworn personnel\nBut we need more than that and we're working really hard we have a group of twenty four in an academy right now another twenty four to come\n\n\n\n\nOver a number of years when it comes to the university police force what's your jurisdiction we know that Tucson police department has to operate within the city the county sheriff's operate within the county what what are the boundaries for the university police department\nArizona's pretty progressive and in many ways and in this one any police officer in the state of Arizona as a police officer anywhere in the state so jurisdiction wise we are commissioned for the University of Arizona that's our our uh authority\nHowever you'll see is primarily between eighth street and Adam Campbell the Euclid but we've got properties all over town we can go anywhere in the state\nWe talked about alcohol issues what are the big problems other than alcohol and drug issues but what are the typical problems thankfully as you said we don't have things like murders on campus but what are the problems we do have well\nHave had them you know unfortunately we're not immune from that uh but our major crimes would be the crimes against property the theft the burglaries you leave all your laptop unattended at the library it could just walk off I don't know it just ... legs and leaves\nOther than alcohol and drug issues but what are the typical problems thankfully as you said we don't have things like murders on campus but what are the problems we do have\nWell we have had them you know unfortunately we're not immune from that\nBut our major crimes would be the crimes against property the theft the burglaries you leave all your laptop unattended at the library\nIt could just walk off I don't know it just ... legs and leaves so those type of the issues are really what we deal with the most and then like I said the the alcohol and the drugs [noise]\nWe have had the homicides we have our sexual assaults we're fortunate that we don't have\nThe stranger type of sexual assault that other places do\nIt doesn't mean that it can't occur here like I said but again I contribute a lot of this to our campus community keeping eyes out you know a sane came out after nine eleven if you see something say something and we're really pushing that again uh we need those additional eyes and ears and people are becoming\nAgain more vigilant and calling and reporting things saying something just doesn't seem right\nAnd I've always told folks around here describing\nOur campus community keeping eyes out you know a sane came out after nine eleven if you see something say something and we're really pushing that again uh we need those additional eyes and ears and people are becoming again more vigilant and calling and reporting things saying something

or what seems writer out a place and we're getting more and more calls that people see this just doesn't seem right which is great we'd much rather come over and take a moment to figure out that it is nothing instead of coming over later and finding out that somebody has been a victim\nTalking with you a PD police chief Brian see stone we have a street preachers ah in the university union and there are other people who are on campus protesting and things like that\nUniversities are known as a place of free speech how ... how do you deal with that as a police department or from disturbances two

part of growing up and seeing the real world some of these folks have never seen this in yes some of those words are harmful and things um you know we've told people if you don't like it don't engage walk on by\nWhat's a typical day if there is such a thing in law enforcement for a typical officer at the University of Arizona\nYou know that's really a an interesting question that I'm asked because\nI I said this is the place that you can go from a fire alarm to the next thing you're dealing with a large crowd out on the the mall to meeting a Nobel laureate\nTo just sitting down and talking to people most of the day is spent responding to calls we encourage people like I said to get out and and walk and be engaged so there's a lot of community interaction we do the liaison program throughout the day\nYou know there have been times that we've called in swing shift in graveyards to come in and help us and other agencies it just all depends you know there is no typical day\nOne of the things you mentioned a moment ago was sexual assaults here on campus looked back\nThe calls we encourage people like I said to get out and and walk and be engaged so there's a lot of

with them talk about sexual assault and what the agency is doing to try and decrease that number\nOne sexual assault has one too many and over the years we have worked with a number of groups on campus from dean of students to campus house to the oasis centered and women's resource center [noise] how can we get the word out that we want people to report\nWe don't care if they prosecute or not the important thing is to report so that they can get the resources necessary to help the victims the survivors and so we have trained our office are a detectives in um\nTo the oasis centered and women's resource center how can we get the word out that we want people to report\nWe don't care if they prosecute or not the important thing is to report so that they can get the resources necessary

line level officers and the questioning and how we question\nTo get just basic facts so that we're not having to repeat the same information over and over the most important thing is the survivor or out of this and we want to make sure that they're taking care of and that's our number one priority\nThe stats that somewhere Eighteen to twenty reported assaults a year I'm gathering from what you're saying those are the reported the number is higher and you I guess he want to see that number go up in some ways obviously would really like it to zero in reality\nAbsolutely but um I Would much rather know what's going on out there\nIs the survivor or out of this and we want to make sure that they're taking care of and that is our number one priority\nThe stats that somewhere Eighteen to twenty reported assaults a year I'm gathering from what you're saying those are the reported the number is higher and you I guess he want to see that number go up in some ways obviously would really like it to be zero in reality absolutely but\nUm I Would much rather know what's going on out there when I became chief about four years ago we did a real effort to make sure that people know that more hears support and that it's okay to report and\nWe saw a ... a rise in last year I think we saw a little bit of a drop a I haven't seen for this year yet but I suspect the numbers are going to go up just a little bit\nMore and more people are feeling more comfortable especially with the movements that are going on now people are feeling more confident in secure that I can do this I can report these type of things\nDrugs and alcohol or a big problem with the sexual assaults\nAlcohol and drugs are usually involved it doesn't mean that anybody did anything wrong but they they were there but\nOffice in all of these other groups what is consent and respect each other's right to say no you've\nBeen on campus thirty plus years in law enforcement how students changed in that time or or has day\nI Would say that they really have not changed\nDepending on political issues and things you may see more activism or that type of thing\nThere are times that will see a year or two where it's just like put this is a little bit different it's it's a little bit quieter but overall I think things have remained\nThe one thing I Will say now is that we're seeing more commitment to a
