Tucson at eighty eight point nine K. U. A. S. F. M. H. D. Sierra Vista broadcast service of the University of Arizona six o'clock\n\nWelcome to the bus I'm Christopher Connelly over on today's show we've heard about the power of the Latino vote in Arizona\nWhich could reorient safe politics but has that changed materialized for will it in the near future this week we dig into the factors driving the Latino vote and look at what it will take to get those voters to the ballot box we speak with Jaime mallette or a Republican Party strategist in Phoenix\nYou have a third of the population Latino but only a fifth are registered voters and all those registered voters you know a much smaller percentage actually vote\nOn a consistent basis we'll also hear from Lisa ... is a political science professor at the University of Arizona who specializes in Latino voters\nThey're on sort of the precipice of being able to change election but at this point if there's not some sort of mobilization efforts that are really stepped up they're not going to turn out and we'll wrap up with a look back at this week's debate in Arizona second\nCongressional district in twenty\nVoters you know a much smaller percentage actually vote on a consistent basis we'll also hear from Lisa ... as a political science professor at the University of Arizona who specializes in Latino voters\nThey're on sort of a pacifist or being able to change election fight at this point if there's not some sort of mobilization efforts that are really stepped out they're not going to turn out and we'll wrap up with a look back at this week's debate in Arizona second congressional district\nIn twenty sixteen it seemed like all we heard was that the sleeping giant up the Latino vote was going to awake it didn't this year it's no longer a main point of election analysis I asked him a letter why not\nKnow I've been hearing that for Twenty years it's been a 'em long income and I think there was a couple of factors I still believe even though Arizona has a third of its population Latino we only have a fifth that boat\nAnd I've been critical of the Republican Party not being aggressive enough and engaging Latino voters ... on on on the other side of the coin\nDemocrats don't do a good job also I I just don't see either political party being aggressive and going out and and and going after those boats and I think on the Democratic side that tends to be well they're already with us there's no reason\nThe factors I still believe even though Arizona has a third of its population Latino we only have a fifth that vote\nAnd I've been critical of the Republican Party not being aggressive enough and engaging Latino voters ... on on on the other side of the coin\nDemocrats don't do a good job also I I just don't see either political party being aggressive and going out and and and going after those boats and I think on the Democratic side that tends to be well they're already with us there's no reason to be aggressive\nAnd Republican side they feel like well they're not going to vote for us so I go after him so I think both parties need to look at long term how they start to engage with Latino voters\nIs it true anymore though that Latino voters or at least in Arizona with Democrats and not with Republicans\nNormally it's still true by and large I mean if you look at the numbers are Democrats tend to do better with the Latino vote but there are certain candidates that have been able to over the years uh do very well in the Latino based John McCain is a great example aside for maybe the election against Brock Obama when he ran for president\nHe did very well and all of his senatorial races or with the Latino vote sometimes going over fifty percent but by and large about about half of the vote came to him\nBy and large I mean if you look at the numbers are Democrats tend to do better with the Latino vote but there are certain candidates that had been able to over the years ah do very well in the Latino based John McCain is a great example aside from maybe the election against Brock Obama when he ran for president\nHe did very well and all of his senatorial races or with the Latino vote sometimes going over fifty percent but by and large about about half of the vote came to him [noise]\nBut let's face it other candidates having done so well Republican ticket and I think they need to really start thinking about long term how do they start to approach that base\nHow did they approach the base if you if you were king of the Republican Party for a day or four or for on election cycle how did they approach the Latino base\nI think having candidates Leah markets Peterson rate example she's running and congressional district to a very serious candidate businesswoman heads up the Tucson Hispanic Chamber\nI think that helps quite a bit when you have strong candidates\nThat are Latino that would I think be attractive to go to the Latino communities and say look you know I'm One of you and and and this is what I stand for and help future voters to understand well she or he is not too far from us I also think that the ...\nAnd great example she's running and congressional district to a very serious candidate businesswoman heads up the Tucson Hispanic Chamber\nI think that helps quite a bit when you have strong candidates\nThat are Latino that would I think be attractive to go to the Latino communities and say look you know I'm One of you and and and this is what I stand for and help future voters to understand well she or he is not too far from us\nI also think that the Republican Party needs to just do the blocking and tackling like to do it everywhere else spend money get out the vote or start to advertise more and channels are outlets that that reached Latino population\nIt's not rocket science said something I think that they should be done or more aggressively we're talking\nWith Jaime him a letter you mentioned John McCain before and after he died one of his very close advisors said if John McCain that had to pick his successor he would have picked a Latina Hispanic woman surprised by that\nNot not really I I had an opportunity to get to know Senator McCain and he was very good about that I mean as good as far as reaching out to the new community and being very strong in in ...\nJohn McCain before and after he died one of his very close advisors said if John McCain had had to pick his successor he would have picked a Latina Hispanic woman surprised by that\nNot not really I I had an opportunity to get to know Senator McCain\nAnd he was very good about that I mean as good as far as reaching out to dinner community and being very strong in understanding what the what it meant for the Republican Party long term and for\nConservative principles long term he felt the Latino community was more aligned with Republican philosophy\nOr the Democrats he really believed that\nAnd so that's why I think he was a one of the few that really made that a focal point of his campaign zoo and he was one when he ran he did put his money where his mouth is\nThey invested in Latino outreach and they spent money on Latino or outlets and really went after that community\nIf twenty sixteen was supposed to be the year that the the sleeping giant of the Latino vote awoke as you said you'd heard it for Twenty years why are we not hearing so much talk about it and twenty Eighteen is it because it's a mid term and not a presidential year\nPossibly you know it's interesting that you would think\nWhen he ran he did put his money where his mouth as they invested in Latino outreach and they spent money on Latino or outlets and really went after that community\nIf twenty sixteen was supposed to be the year that the the sleeping giant of the Latino vote awoke as you said you'd heard it for Twenty years why are we not hearing so much talk about it and twenty Eighteen is it because it's a mid term and not a presidential year\nPossibly you know it's interesting that you would think you'd hear about it more just because if the Democrats are going to be successful and particularly\nOr their candidate for governor Davis Garcia in Latino would need to really perform well they're they're going to need to get out the vote significantly within their democratic base in order to overcome the Republican\nA registered voter advantage and the Latino outreach is going to be a big part of that effort if they're going to be successful or not just in his race but of an an all the tickets\nBut I just haven't seen that yet then again it goes back to my point where I think sometimes they take for granted oh well they're just going to be with us and and I think they're going to do that at their peril\nAre we getting to a point in Arizona and just because of our demographics that any voter outreach is Latino\nAnd the Latino outreach is going to be a big part of that effort if they're going to be successful or not just in his race for the un and all the tickets but I just haven't seen that yet and again it goes back to my point where I think sometimes they take for granted oh well they're just going to be with us and and I think they're going to do that at their peril\nAre we getting to a point in Arizona and just because of our demographics that any voter outreach is Latino voter outreach\nOn both sides not so much not yet I think there's a couple of factors the Latino population in Arizona it's still very very young and and as we know young voters still really aren't voting the way in other age groups are demographics are voting\nOver time I think that will happen just because of the numbers are right now you have\nA majority of kids that are graduating high school in Arizona are Latino so over fifty percent so eventually it will happen but I think right now each party needs to be aggressive and how do they market how do they target and how do they do that get out the vote in the Latino community do you have\nMarket differently to the Latino community than you do to other communities or is it just more of a targeted make sure they see the message\nNow you have a majority of kids that are graduating high school in Arizona are Latino over fifty percent so eventually it will happen but I think right now each party needs to be aggressive and how do they market how do they target and how do they do that get out the vote in the Latino community\nDo you have to market differently to the Latino community than you do to other communities or is it just more of a targeted make sure they see the message as you would with any other community putting your message and the right places for those communities to see it\nI give you an example if you go and live in the Catalina foothills I Would bet you're going to get dozens of phone calls from uh the direct marketing organizations trying to get you to vote for their particular candidate over their particular issue\nThey're probably going to get more than dozens of direct mail pieces you're going to have a lot of signs and you're going to have a lot of target because those are areas that boat at a very high level\nYou go to south Tucson and I would wager you're not going to get that same kind of attention you're not going to get those touches that you normally would and and it's really because campaigns with limited budgets usually they will try and go to those individuals they no vote and that have that ...\nThan dozens of direct mail pieces you are going to have a lot of signs and you're gonna have a lot of target because those are areas that boat at a very high level\nYou go to south Tucson and I would wager you're not going to get that same kind of attention you're not going to get those touches that you normally would end is really because campaigns with limited budgets usually they will try and go to those individuals they no vote and that have that ... to vote\nAnd so the problem is is that the cycle repeats itself it's a self fulfilling prophecy they just don't go after those voters because they figure out they're not going to vote anyway so I'm going to go to those target rich environment\nIt sounds like in order to uh get the Latino vote the first thing you have to do is register Latinos and the second thing you have to do is just get them to go to the polls so they start getting the phone calls in the mail\nNow there's been some candidates in some areas ... who's running for mayor of the city of Phoenix\nHas put together a very impressive organization and the Latino outreach but that's just for his campaign's when he ran for city council I Know that's going to be a big part of his ... campaign is how do we or how does he get out to Latino voters and how does he get in touch them and make them understand how important it is\nPhone calls in the mail now there's been some candidates in some areas\n... who's running for mayor of the city of Phoenix has put together a very impressive organization and the Latino outreach but that's just for his campaign's when he ran for city council I Know that's going to be a big part of his ... campaign is how do we or how does he get out\nTo Latino voters and how does he get in touch them and make them understand how important it is for them to be voting\nIn if you look at different areas of the state to I think a Latino votes within Arizona\nAre much much different one part of the state versus another part of the state can't give me an example of that so in in in uh southern Arizona again I use the the Jon Kyl and John McCain example they did extremely well in the border areas ... Douglas\nI remember Jon Kyl did extremely well in southern Arizona now he didn't do so well and Pima County in Tucson\nBut on the border areas where people liked his his positions on immigration a but they also liked his positions on border and border security a job creations those are the kinds of things that appeal to Latino limit on the border versus maybe a Latinos living in big cities of Tucson in Phoenix\nNo gallows humor Douglas I remember Jon Kyl did extremely well in southern Arizona now you didn't do so well and Pima County in Tucson\nBut on the border areas where people liked his his positions on immigration are but they also elected positions on border and border security a job creations those are the kinds of things that appeal to Latino living on the border versus maybe a Latinos living in big cities of Tucson and Phoenix\nThat was ... Republican Party strategist based in Phoenix\nTo really engage with the different populations and kind of see what you know what they want and what they need from this process and if that's not happening for a piece of our population that's just skyrocketing that's a problem\nWhen it comes to reaching out to Latino voters beat in Arizona or anywhere else do candidates need to reach out differently is it just a language issue or is it more than that\nThat's kind of an open question on and there's a good bit of research that's being done on that right now and it does help 'em in\nAnd what they need from this process and if that's not happening for a piece of our population that's just skyrocketing that's a problem\nWhen it comes to reaching out to Latino voters beat in Arizona or anywhere else do candidates need to reach out differently is it just a language issue or is it more than that\nThat's kind of an open question on and there's a good bit of research that's being done on that right now\nAnd it does help um in terms of sort of having a different you know being able to breach the language barriers\nOther parts of sort of I think authenticity is a problem right so people who are sort of claiming to be Latino and not to say that you know you can't sort of say that your your ethnicity is Latino but maybe not well in touch with the Latino population and sort of what issues are really affecting up yeah I think that's a huge problem for the mobilization\nIn Arizona right now the census numbers put the Latino population about thirty percent if that number gets closer to fifty does that make a big change in the Latino vote does the sleeping giant as we talk about finally awake\nThat's the hope so some of my research touches on that and part of it is that they just have enough numbers that politicians have to pay attention right otherwise they're not going to be reelected but\nHuge problem for the mobilization in Arizona right now the census numbers put the Latino population about thirty percent if that number gets closer to fifty does that make a big change in the Latino vote does the sleeping giant as we talk about finally awake\nThat's the hope so some of my research touches on that and part of it is that they just have enough numbers that politicians have to pay attention right otherwise they're not going to be reelected\nBut you still hit on that issue is do they come out and vote and you know basic statistics will teach you that the more of the population you have the more likely they are to vote so it's likely that that will have a big effect and they'll also\nBe aging at that point so that the ages catch up\nWell yeah I mean there's some really good statistics out there that talk about you know every sixty seconds a certain a couple of thousand Latino voters become eligible just based on the age requirement that is going to be big in terms of of sort of coming of age of this population especially in Arizona\nLisa ... is a professor at the University of Arizona school of government and public policy we're going back to the Latino voters you met earlier we also asked them if they think their vote matters\nEvery every person's vote matters so the more people who vote and speak their voice\nLatino voters become eligible just based on the age requirement that's going to be big in terms of a sort of coming of age of

can\nPressure I think in ... overall and does matter to vote 'em especially if if everyone does say for sure there will be a type that will be a show\nUh yes I think what matters just as much as anybody else in this world\nOne individual vote doesn't really make a difference but we always make sure that everyone understands or a group that it matters\nAre the only way it's going to matter as a group as if everyone votes as an individual\nHave grown up thinking that it does matter and that makes a difference so yeah I Hope it does and I hope it does this election\nThose were again the voices of voters Carlos adult go under a Saudi a Veronica pause\nThe vigil vote doesn't really make a difference but we always make sure that everyone understands that [noise] a grill it matters [noise]\nAnd the only way that it's going to matter as I grew up as if everyone votes as an individual\nAnd coming up thinking that it does matter and that makes a difference so yeah I Hope it does

Republican leaders Marquez Peterson are vying to represent southern Arizona second congressional district in the U.S house that's the district that includes the eastern part of the Tucson metro area

the Marquez Peterson is how are the people in the middle ear and their message so I see that the one that resonates best with those people in the middle that's the one that will win that it might be blue and it might be with\nYou all as as voters in a purple district or as you all have said view this election this midterm election as a referendum on the Trump presidency\nI think the mid term election is always a it's always been a problem for the party in power and a and I think more so this year because of the president and his behavior I voted for President Trump because uh\nThe one that way and then it might be blue and it might be read\nJane you all is as voters in a purple district guy as you all have said view this election this midterm election as a referendum on the Trump

uh I think that a President Trump is a\nBehaved in such a way to increase the the level of hostility that happens to the existing in the country and and I think yes this or that that will be tests will be tested in this election\nA key aspect to think for all people in CD to to think about this year is what should the Congress do in the next session over the next two years and I think one of the key functions is to hold the administration accountable\nAnd uh that's best done with with the Democrats in control of of of Congress so I think in that sense it is it is a it\nThe existing in the

think in that sense it is it is a it is important and it is imperative that everybody vote to have their voice heard\nI feel like there's so much partisan Democrats versus Republicans ... our fault that if Iran my business the way Washington is being run currently with all the fighting that nothing gets done so I guess I just feel like it's extremely important to get out there and vote but\nI'm the opposite I like the Democrats get in\nWe might as well move to Canada my ...
