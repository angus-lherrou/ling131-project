Tucson at eighty eight point nine K. U. A. S. F. ... Sierra\nVista a broadcast service of the University of Arizona it's six o'clock\n\nWelcome to the bugs I'm Christopher Connelly over\nArizona senators have drawn\nA lot of national attention this year Senator Jeff flake\nDecision to retire created an open race for his seat\nAnd Jon Kyl was appointed to fill the other US Senate seat after a long time Senator John McCain died on today's show we'll hear from Senator Kyl and one of the candidates or the other seat will also spend time talking about the tone of this year's Arizona's Senate race\nFirst we speak with care students cinema a democratic member of the U.S house of representatives and candidate for the U.S Senate\nShe spent six years in the U.S house representing the metro Phoenix area she sat down with us one day after her debate with Republican Martha ...\nWe began or discussion talking about possible changes to the marketplace where the Affordable CARE Act because there's only one insurance option in most of Arizona so first let me just say that\nStudents cinema a democratic member of the U.S house of representatives and Kennedy for the U.S Senate\nShe spent six years in the U.S house representing the metro Phoenix area she sat down with us one day after her debate with Republican Martha McSally\nWe begin or discussion talking about possible changes to the marketplace where the Affordable CARE Act because there's only one insurance option in most of Arizona\nSo first let me just say that this is the part of our current health care system that's working the worst it's not working well in Arizona folks I only have one option for provider and if they don't qualify for a subsidy is not affordable they can't afford to pay the premiums are that adaptable\nI actually think that we should reconsider and this part of the healthcare law\nAnd figure out a new way to provide care to people who don't get coverage through their employer or who own their own small business so that's an area of health care law that I Want effects\nBut I also got to tell you that as I traveled to stay and hear from Arizona and health care and number one issue that people talk to me about and while they're concerned about the increasing costs of health care they're even more concerned about what's at stake and what they could lose so people with preexisting conditions talk to me I worry\nAnd figure out a new way to provide care to people who don't get coverage through their employer or who own their own small business so that's an area of health care law that I Want to fix\nBut I also got to tell you that as I traveled to state and hear from Arizona and health care and number one issue that people talked about and while they're concerned about the increasing costs of health care they're even more concerned about what's at stake and what they could lose\nSo people with preexisting conditions talk to me every single day and are concerned about losing that protection if it were to be taken away by Congress they tried once last year\nThey said they're going to try again right after the election then nearly two point eight million Arizona's could lose access to their health care coverage and that's really scary for people\nThe president recently announced a renegotiation of what was enough to has a new name now from what you've seen of it and it's obviously a ... document or is it a good deal for Arizona\nWas too early for us to tell what this new trade agreement will be like for Arizona but one thing I can tell you that we do know about already is the impact that terrorists have had on Arizona's economy terrorists has been hitting us particularly hard because we do a lot of manufacturing and we have a very ...\nA renegotiation of what was enough to has a new name now from what you've seen of it and it's obviously a ... document or is it a good deal for Arizona\nWell it's too early for us to tell what this new trade agreement will be like for Arizona but one thing I can tell you that we do know about already is the impact that terrorists have had on Arizona's economy\nTerrorists has been hitting us particularly hard because we do a lot of manufacturing and we have a very robust agricultural community so I hear from cotton farmers in southern Arizona\nThat they're earning twenty five percent less per bushel than they were before the tariffs we've seen five dairy farms that has sold since the terrorists have come into effect\nAnd I hear from our manufacturing folks\nEvery day that there are concerned about these increased costs around aluminum and steel so businesses tell me over and over again that they're paying more\nAnd getting lesson profit because of these terrorists we need to have those good agreements and those good working relationships for Arizona businesses to thrive\nLot of time you saw members of Congress hubs shall we say a bit of an east coast a centric view of things\nConcerned about these increased costs around aluminum and steel so businesses tell me over and over again that they're paying more and getting lesson profit because at these terrorists\nWe need to have those good agreements and those good working relationships for Arizona businesses to thrive\nA lot of tons of members of Congress hubs shall we say a bit of an east coast a centric view of things how do you push through those western priorities on public versus private land and water issues that may be some of the more powerful east coast members of the sun it don't understand\nI'm so glad you brought this up because Washington is chaotic mess and they certainly have an east coast bias\nAnd so as a Westerner born and raised right here in southern Arizona I take as much time as I can teaching my colleagues about what it means to be a Westerner and what it means to be an Arizona and so some of the policies that they have put forward in Washington just don't work for us we'll give it to examples\nThere is a provision on to allow the sale of public lands to private entities without any public input and in Arizona that doesn't fly another\nA real difference between westerners in east coasters is on the issue\nSouthern Arizona I take as much time if I can teaching my colleagues about what it means to be a Westerner and what it means to be an Arizona and so some of the policies that they have put forward in Washington just don't work for us we'll give it to examples\nThere is a provision on to allow the sale of public lands to private entities without any public input and in Arizona that doesn't fly another\nA real difference between westerners in east coasters is on the issue of privacy and so when there is legislation that allows Internet companies to sell the private data of Americans including your Social Security number your home address your children's private information\nI wrote a known that legislation because in Arizona we don't believe that private entities or the government should have access to our private information\nOne further example would be the issue of the border we hear folks back on the east coast talking about how they want to transfer to security and immigration but they don't really know much about the border and they've not been there and they haven't experienced or seen it but\nI Know that we need a robust comprehensive strategy to keep our border secure and that we do need to make important changes in our immigration law to provide a path to citizenship for dreamers you bring up the border so let's talk about it to those\nFor example would be the issue of the border we hear folks back on the east coast talking about how they want to transport or security and immigration but they don't really know much about the border and they've not been there and they haven't experienced or seen it but\nI Know that we need a robust comprehensive strategy to keep our border secure and that we do need to make important changes in our immigration law to provide a path to citizenship for dreamers\nYou bring up the border so let's talk about it two thousand southerners and attempt to comprehensive immigration reform bipartisan failed we had the gang of eight that included our than two U.S senators Kyle and McCain\nFailed is there one lynchpin bit will get a bipartisan bill through when it comes to border security and immigration\nReform the reality is we have the votes to solve this problem what we don't have is the cooperation of leadership and people who are trying to score political points they're stopping us from getting this done even though we've got the solutions right and our hands so I was introduced a bill called the usa act\nIt's a bipartisan half Democrat half Republican\nIt funds smart border security like drones and boots on the ground and cameras night vision\nThe reality is we have the votes to solve this problem what we don't have is the cooperation of leadership and people who are trying to score political points they're stopping us from getting this done even though we've got the solutions right and our hands so I was introduced a bill called the usa act\nIt's a bipartisan half Democrat half Republican\nIt funds smart border security like drones and boots on the ground and cameras night vision tools but it partners with a path to citizenship for dreamers who are such an important part of Arizona's lifelike and our economy\nAnd we've got the votes to pass this legislation but unfortunately there hardliners in both parties who refused to compromise and find common ground in the middle and if we can get them to move out of the way and let us grownups do the work we could get this done\nLet me jump back to water for a second the sun and is working on a new drug contingency plan a Senator Kyl Senator Flake ... great things about it but I was a member of the Senate obviously you would have a some say on it if you've seen it is it a good idea you know the changes the updates\nAnd is it time for Arizona to stop being in junior partner uh on the Colorado so the key\nAs grownups do the work we can get this done\nLet me jump back to water for a second the Senate is working on a new drug contingency plan a Senator Kyl Senator Flake or both said great things about it but I was a member of the Senate obviously you would have a some say on it if you've seen it is it a good idea you know the changes the updates\nAnd is it time for Arizona to stop being a junior partner or on the Colorado\nSo the key for Arizona's future when it comes to water is\nForging partnerships with our states in the region we've got to have good healthy ... space working relationships of Colorado New Mexico Nevada California so that we all can share that water in a way that's equitable and provides long term sustainability for Arizona\nNow Senator Kyl has been a leader on the issue of water for many years and now that he's back serving in the United States Senate and it's my hope to work with him\nUm as the United states senator to find this regional shared agreement it is absolutely important that we do this together Arizona should not go alone at this issue because we can't achieve our objective unless we worked together\nJumping to military Davis mountain air force base home to the eight ten it's the main playing\nThe issue of water for many years and now that he's back serving in the United States Senate um it's my hope to work with him\nUm as the United states senator to find this regional shared agreement it is absolutely important that we do this together Arizona should not go alone at this issue because we can't achieve our objective unless we worked together\nJumping to military Davis Monson air force base home to the time it's the main points flown out of there what can you do as a member of the Senate from Arizona to protecting Davis mountain in the event of another round of base closures which have been rumored to possibly becoming within the next few years\nHave been attempts to close bases in Arizona in the past and the good news is if the Arizona delegation has always worked together Republicans and Democrats to stop those attempts and Davis Monson is so important for our community I visited it myself and seen first hand\nThe incredible work that they do and that's why I just this year we increased funding for Davis mountain by fifty two million dollars we also increased funding for the a ten by a hundred and sixty three million dollars but my work to protect a ten has gone back for many years in two thousand fourteen I was working with Congress\nPublic and some Democrats to stop those attempts and Davis Monson is so important for our community I visited myself and seen first hand\nThe incredible work that they do and that's why I just this year we increased funding for Davis Monson by fifty two million dollars we also increased funding for a ten by a hundred and sixty three million dollars\nBut my work to protect a ten has gone back for many years in two thousand fourteen I was working with then Congressman Ron barber who served here in southern Arizona before Martha McSally was elected\nAnd we can talk with Candice Miller who was a Republican member of Congress\nAnd we fought hard to say the ... and we got it done the reality is to save important programs like a ten and important parts of our community like day this month and it has to be done together in a bipartisan way\nYou had some um shall we say less than flattering comments for the U.S Senate as a whole all over the nomination of now justice Calvin on the U.S Supreme Court if the Democrats take the house there already is Democrats saying they will begin an impeachment of\nJustice cabinet if that went through and you were in the sun it it could come to the Senate to have him move that's son his job to vote that up or down would you\nHas to be done together in a bipartisan way\nYou had some um shall we say less than flattering comments for the U.S Senate as a whole all over the nomination of now justice Kevin on the U.S Supreme Court\nIf the Democrats take the house there already is Democrats saying they will begin an impeachment of justice cabinet if that went through when you were in the sun it it could come to the Senate to have him move that's the son his job to vote that up or down would you vote that up or down ...\nI Would not support impeachment while I Believe that the Senate engaged in a really horrific process I mean they they turned it into a circus and I believe they denigrated the importance of this process in the United States Senate\nAnd I think more and more people are living in the moment that said as people put campaigns out on the Internet there's a digital digital a history left there and future campaigns can pull segments and say well don't you recall when you said this in this ad\nAnd so if if other campaigns in the future pool what current campaigns are saying then yes I could affect future basis\nTimes our memories become shorter and shorter and I think more and more people are living in the moment that said as people put campaigns out on the Internet there's a digital digital a history left there and future campaigns can pull segments and say well don't you recall when you said this in this ad\nAnd so if if other campaigns in the future poll what current campaigns are saying and yes I could affect future races\nAll right well we'll leave it there and see how this one turns out thank you thanks that was you a political communication professor Cape can ski we'll hear from

old blood low since returning to the Senate\nFirst of all feels great to be back in Tucson [laughter] haven't been back here for a while and uh it's good to see my old friends here and\nHere again some of the issues that for some reason the issues seem to remain the same VA still has a problem still have a problem that on the border and we're still trying to protect our military installations and the like which is all good to hear about today\nWashington has a little different uh but except for the Kavanaugh hearings it's not that different\nAnd I had spent some time back in Washington After I left the Senate as well\nBut the Kevin hearings after the allegations of impropriety really turned the place into an environment that was not fun to be in and I'm sure it wasn't very attractive to be watched\nHopefully that will dissipate over time after the election and people have time to relax their family and thinking whoa thinking it over and go home and while a will come\nExcept for the Kavanaugh hearings it's not that different and I had spent some time back in Washington After I left the Senate as well but the Kevin hearings after the allegations of impropriety really turned the place into an environment that was not fun to be in and I'm sure it wasn't very attractive to be watched\nHopefully that will dissipate over time after the election and people have time to relax their family and thinking I don't think it over and go home a while a will come back in January and work okay there's also a small lame duck session in November and December to finish up some of the things that need to be done\nYou mentioned the Kavanaugh hearings saying they weren't fun but hopefully those wounds can heal Muslims looks\nPretty deep they are when when the stakes aren't as high I suspect the emotions won't be as high\nA Democrat saw big stakes here in member going on the Supreme Court to they thought would would not be the kind of judge that they wanted and they wanted to stop him at all cost and they tried very hard hopefully the issues that will have to face in the future won't engender that same kind of\nA emotional hostility that you saw\nMet with veterans today you just mentioned that from what they're telling you is Washington doing enough\nAre Democrats saw big stakes here in member going on the Supreme Court who they thought would would not be the kind of judge that they wanted and they wanted to stop him at all cost and they tried very hard hopefully the issues that will have to face in the future won't engender that same kind of\nA emotional hostility that you saw\nYou met with veterans today you just mentioned that from what they're telling you is Washington doing enough for the men and women who have left the military you\nKnow and part of the problem is the nature of the VA system\nDuring the time I was gone the whole ... of the problems in the VA came up came to public light and Congress in the meantime has done a lot to try to fix them including the mission act which a market next Sally talked about today and she had a lot to do with\nUh this offer some real opportunity for improvement but right here in the in Tucson\nThe ratings for the VA and in Tucson went down to the bottom and nobody quite figure out why so we're going to try to get to the bottom of that are there still problems that need to be fixed let's put it that way and ah whenever you've got a big government run system like that I I think you can expect to have problems\nAlso mentioned immigration I remember doing it in ...\nTalked about today and she had a lot to do with uh this offer some real opportunity for improvement but right here in the in Tucson\nThe ratings for the VA and in Tucson went down to the bottom and nobody quite figure out why so we're going to try to get to the bottom of that there are still problems that need to be fixed let's put it that way and ah whenever you've got a big government run system like that I I think you can expect to have problems\nYou also mentioned immigration I remember doing an interview with you like this in two thousand seven sit in the Senate office in Washington the immigration deal had just fallen apart\nNow after six years gone um immigration still on the table is there anything is there a Lynch tend to make immigration has he been through it a couple of times\nSomehow the politics has to be taken out of it as long as the politics are there it's not going to get solved we had a solution to the so called doc a problem I thought it was a good solution and then there were subsequent solutions to it but some people want a political issue rather than a solution and as long as that's the equation it's going to be very hard to get anything done\nMention a political issue on all the things we've just talked about is that the new norm now it's really a political issue not solutions\nOut of it as long as the politics are there it's not going to get solved we had a solution to the so called taco problem I thought it was a good solution and then there were subsequent solutions to it but some people want a political issue rather than a solution and as long as that's the equation it's going to be very hard to get anything done\nYou mentioned a political issue on all the things we just talked about is that the new norm now it's really a political issue not solutions that are going on\nObviously politics has always been a big part of Washington and um there have been times in our history when it's been pretty nasty as it is right now\nBut you'd like to get over that uh you'd like to have a more civil discourse in a place that we're supposed to have that conversation namely in the house and in the Senate with the president\nAnd when the lack of civility impede the ability of the members to get together and make policy for the good of the country\nAre you have to ask what the causes of that are and what we can do to help uh you got to be nicer and we've got to get back to civility so that we can have a debate about the merits of the issues rather than calling each other names and are just trying to throw sand in the works because we don't like\nAnd when the lack of civility impede the ability of the members to get together and make policy for the good of the country\nAre you have to ask what the causes of that are and what we can

that to thought that he needs [noise] um I ... I left the Senate in two thousand Thirteen after having served in it for Eighteen years\nIn addition to eight years in the house\nAnd uh there comes a point when you say I I've done enough there's always more you can do but if you follow that rule you never leave then I think there's a point at which people should probably\nBut at first because he'll have the obligation of and pointing my successor and I want to make sure he has plenty of time to give that the thought that he needs um I ... I left the Senate and two thousand Thirteen after having served in it for Eighteen years in addition to eight years in the house\nAnd uh there comes a point when you say I I've done enough there's always more you can do but if you follow that rule you never leave then I think there's a point at which people should probably leave before they have to be hauled out some who can serve to the end of their career with great distinction uh my old colleague John McCain was one\nIn my case I have obligations to my family and I think I served my time and it really is time to make way for someone else and so I'll\nProbably make that decision at some point governor do so you don't have the opportunity to appoint somebody to take my place but I must say I was very honored that he was elected me to serve in John's seat and um it's a real privilege to serve the people of Arizona again as I said I couldn't wait to get to Tucson just to\nRevisit places and people that I've known for so long and and
