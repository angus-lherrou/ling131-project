week and election day is just over two weeks away on today's show will explain what all those ballot questions are about so you can be prepared to cast your vote Mm\n\nLet's start with some of the

country state retirement systems are in danger of failure two years ago Arizona made changes to the retirement system for police and firefighters\nProposition one twenty five would make changes to the state retirement plans for corrections officers and elected officials as part of a continued effort to stabilize the pension system\nA yes vote will change and you will benefit increases for those

acting any new or increased tax on services a no vote allows for future taxation\nOne of the highest profile ballot issues this year deals with renewable energy as easy PM Vanessa barks field explains the decision by Arizona voters could determine the state's energy future\nProposition one twenty seven would amend the state constitution and require energy utilities including Tucson electric power to get half of their electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar by the year twenty thirty now Arizona already has of renewable energy standard\nAbout what issues this year deals with renewable energy as easy PM Minnesota barks field explains the decision by Arizona voters could determine the state's energy future\nProposition one twenty seven would amend the state constitution and require energy utilities including Tucson electric power to get hassled their electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar by the year twenty thirty\nNow Arizona already has of renewable

own on the group that's pushing for prop one twenty seven she's in the current standard which she coauthored in the mid to thousands was a good start\nBut we are now following far behind our neighbors\nCalifornia's governor Jerry Brown signed a law last month that will move the state to one hundred percent renewable energy by twenty forty five\n... says she sees renewable energy as a manger tool for job creation and with its abundance sunshine Arizona has the potential to be generating large amounts of solar power on the other hand if the state doesn't make progress she says will lose out on jobs and economic divide\nFar behind our neighbors\nCalifornia's governor Jerry Brown signed a law last month that will move the state to one hundred percent renewable energy by twenty forty five\nMe says she say renewable energy as a major tool for job creation and with its abundance sunshine Arizona has the potential to be generating large amounts of solar power on the other hand if the state doesn't make progress she says will lose out on jobs and economic development major corporations\nLike Google and Amazon a Microsoft\nThey're all creating internal renewable energy requirements and they are not setting up headquarters they are not creating new facilities in states where the utilities are not able or willing to produce renewable energy for them\nThe group Arizona's were for double electricity is leading the charge against prop one twenty seven now you're Benson is their spokesperson\nWe refer to this is an energy tax in a lot of ways because it is going to attack on a significant additional costs every time you get that bill at the end of the month\nThe no campaign cite several different estimates for how much this could cost consumers including a report from T. P.\nAble or willing to produce renewable energy for them\nThe group Arizona's for for double electricity is leading the charge against prop one twenty seven now you're Benson is their spokesperson we\nRefer to this as an energy tax in a lot of ways because it is going to attack on a significant additional cost every time you get that bill at the end of the month\nThe no campaign cite several different estimates for how much this could cost consumers including a report from the pie that says the measure could add five hundred dollars a year to electricity bill for two sons\nYeah they I think people kind of understand that there is no free lunch so if you're going to require that public utilities phase out all of their a base a coal fired plants\nAnd then replace it with thousands and thousands of megawatts worth of solar farms new transmission lines of battery power uh that that's expensive it cost billions and billions of dollars those costs have to get passed along to consumers in there you go\nAnd he says that Clinton is just false and the reports and the natural Resources Defense council says the measure would actually save consumers more than four billion dollars through twenty forty\nKnow that renewable energy sources like solar and wind are coming in at a record low prices\nFarms new transmission lines of battery power uh that that's expensive it cost billions and billions of dollars those costs have to get passed along to consumers and there you go\nMe says that Clinton is just false and the reports and the natural Resources Defense council says the measure would actually save consumers more than four billion dollars through twenty forty\nWe know that renewable energy sources like solar and wind are coming in at\nA record low prices to point two cents a kilowatt hour and the case of solar\nUm we're seeing that it's actually reducing utility bills in states like Colorado and Nevada so when you look at the actual price of renewable energy you see that there is absolutely no way that what the utilities are saying about\nRenewable energy and prop one twenty seven could be true\nThen no one twenty seven campaign also says the proposition would lead to the ... closure of the Navajo generating station\nThat is the country's largest nuclear power plants and it's located about fifty miles west of Phoenix the initiative basically makes tele very uneconomical to operate me says there's nothing in the measure that would lead to the plants closure Arizona Public service or a PS two\nOne twenty seven could be true then no one twenty seven campaign also says the proposition would lead to the ... closure of the Navajo generating station\nThat is the country's largest nuclear power plants and it's located about fifty miles west of Phoenix the initiatives basically makes ... very own economical to operate me says there's nothing in the measure that would lead to the plants closure\nArizona Public service or a PS co owns the plant with six other utilities across the southwest\nAnd he says that means a PS doesn't have the authority to close a plant\nThat nuclear power plant it's going to stay there is going to live out its useful life\nThe campaigns are also traded barbs over funding Matthew Benson says prop one twenty seven is being bankrolled by San Francisco based billionaire Tom's dire who's a major backers progressive candidates and measures\nThis is not an Arizona idea supported by Arizonans uh this is a California idea that has brought to us by California billionaire I Am grateful\nThat someone is helping us to fight a PS and to fight the forces that have refused to allow us to do more clean energy and Arizona\nArizona utilities don't support the measure a PS\nMajor backers progressive candidates and measures\nThis is not an Arizona idea supported by Arizonans uh this is a California idea that has brought to us by California billionaire\nI Am grateful that someone is helping us to fight a PS and to fight the forces that have refused to allow us to do more clean energy and Arizona\nArizona utilities don't support the measure a PS is the largest utility in the states its parent company technical west poured millions of dollars into trying to keep the measure off November ballot unsuccessfully and the companies now pumping money into the no campaign GDP is also bankrolling a group that's fighting the proposition\nNice says a P s has also spent millions of dollars influencing the Arizona corporation commission which regulates utilities\nAnd those commissioners have basically done what ATF wanted them to do um they have stopped the progress of renewable energy and clean energy in the states\nArizona Public service is in Arizona company they've been here for over a century or and they're going to be here after the election to deal with the the the ramifications whatever whatever may come\nThe one point that both campaigns can agree on is that process\nOn a corporation commission which regulates utilities\nAnd those commissioners have basically done what ATF wanted them to do um they have stopped the progress of renewable energy and clean energy and the state\nArizona Public service is in Arizona company they've been here for over a century or they're going to be here after the election to deal with the the the ramifications whatever whatever may come\nAt one point that both campaigns can agree on is that proposition one twenty seven will fundamentally changed the course of Arizona's electricity future they just have very different ideas about what that means I'm ... field reporting for the bus\nTo get a broader perspective on proposition one to seven we spoke with Josh where roads a research associate at the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin I started by asking him what makes prop one to seven so unique\nSo it makes us unique is that it's an actual constitutional amendment there have been plenty of other RPGs is er renewable portfolio standards that have been passed and multiple states around the country including here in Texas and California and Colorado and\nAnd the like but most of them are either you know they they come from executive orders or they come from you know laws passed by legislature or they even come from\nTexas at Austin I started by asking him what makes prop one

states around the country including here in Texas and California and Colorado and\nAnd the like but most of them are either you know they they come from executive orders or they come from you know laws passed by legislature\nOr they even come from some regulatory bodies that if that doesn't motion and there'd been a few other states that have tried to do constitutional amendments but I don't think any others have been successful in that and so that that kind of sets us on the side of this one passes I think it might be the first constitutional amendment renewable portfolio standard\nThe fight against prop one twenty seven as in Arizona is largely financed by the Arizona Public service which is the state's largest utility why the utilities oppose these standards\nThat will require them to do more and do different than they possibly would have 'em before\nAnd utilities the public service commission is all of these uh bodies you know they they're there to make sure that the powers on that that is reliable and I mean introducing large amounts of wind and solar could make their job a little harder it doesn't make it impossible but it could make there\nWhich is the state's

doesn't make it impossible but it could make their job a little harder and so they may um you know want to push back against that type of thing\nHaving looked at these across the country proponents here say this will create tons of jobs especially in the solar industry ozone it say it will dramatically increase Arizona's electricity bills who's right\nA good question so particularly in the construction phase with solar you will get a lot of jobs there are a lot of jobs that come out when building these\nThere is not so many jobs as they kind of long term so the maintenance associated with a solar farms is not is not near as many jobs as the construction the building of the solar farm\nConstruction phase with solar you will get a lot of jobs there are a lot of jobs that come out
