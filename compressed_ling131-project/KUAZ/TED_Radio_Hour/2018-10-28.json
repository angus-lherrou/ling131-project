S. is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version and their their government subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar [noise]\nDo you the WTO have any ability to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time industries like protection they want to be supported by the government they want to get help and they are now seen this\nIndustries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar to use the WTO have any ability to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time\nIndustries like protection they want to be supported by the government is they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call behind the border\nProtection a and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because they're of soup can measure\nThe Arabs you include only a spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board there measure you don't know when they come you don't know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a communities are hearing the W. to discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nSure terrorists you include on your spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the border measure you don't know when they come you know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a committees are hearing the double job will discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nAnd not really a also because some of those are perfectly legal\nYou would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding then or what other countries apply and that would be for the protection of the consumer\nOr it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure\nBut they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations they just stopped trade altogether\nSo that's ah whatever an infinite tariffs at the border\nMeasured and [noise]\nThe WTO says the average tariff rate among its members fell by Fifteen Percent between the organization founding in Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand\nFor preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure\nBut they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations to just stop trade altogether so debts or whatever and infinite terrified at the border\nWell do you measure than [noise]\nThe WTO says the average tariff rate among its members fell by Fifteen Percent between organizations founding in Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand Thirteen [noise]\nThere are however many ... Harris rules are less stringent for developing countries for instance further more trade deals negotiated in good faith by one country's administration can be deemed by a leader administration to be unfair or just an palatable\nAnd China have gotten together and boosted their newfound strategic a partnership\nI'm curious how you think about um you know the WTO has positioned itself to be um theoretically a friend to all or at least a referee to all\nBut when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us ah terrorists and other countries respond by making their own deals I'm\nTheir newfound strategic a partnership I'm curious how you think about um you know the WTO has positioned itself to be um theoretically a friend to all or at least a referee to all\nBut when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us ah terrorists and other countries respond by making their own deals\nI'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of the WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\n[laughter] to be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage or some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the political sensitivities in in many of these players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course I can share with you and the listeners or the content of those\nSometimes I Try to discourage or some courses of action but I also have to understand the political sensitivities in in many of these players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which I\nDon't know very open and very Frank and um of course I can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but uh they're very very Frank and ah we explore all kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance\nOf the system and not to compromise the system and I would say that pretty much everybody I talked to a ... tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen [noise]\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be\nYou know showing the line when others are\nComing up after the break with the head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask him to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far but don't worry Roberto tomato has plenty more to say and we'll hear it after the break\nEven strengthen [noise]\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be\nYou know doing the line when others are\nComing up after the break with\nThe head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask them to make some predictions about trade and the economy by crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nOh well don't worry Roberto as a veto has plenty more to say it will cure it after the break [noise]\nRadio is supported by target presenting future at heart a new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and highlights projects in cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever podcaster found\nFreakonomics radio is supported by progressive insurance offering snapshot a device designed to reward safe drivers learn more at progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\n\nMartin the host and producer of Arizona spotlight helmet\nSure it's offering snapshot a device designed to reward safe drivers learn more at progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\n[noise]\n\n\nI'm Mark map of the host and producer of Arizona spotlight\nHow many times has your radio become an instant portal to another place or another time are giving you another way of looking at the world if you're a listener of public broadcasting that's the kind of thing that happens every day\nPublic Broadcasting's unyielding commitment to sharing the experience and the emotions of everyday people is the reason why I'm dedicated to this mission thanks for listening\nTwo minutes after twelve right now here at NPR eighty nine point one where our support comes from the Tucson symphony orchestra Jose Luis Gomez conduct but dory in the Brahms violin concerto in one performance November second at the Tucson usually call\nTickets are at eight eight to eight five eight five or Tucson symphony dot O.

three factors Brazilian engineering\nAnd being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um\nWell the good thing about being a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse perspective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspect of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer I was always good with numbers\nThe economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural background\nAnd it has aspects of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important ah aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective\nEngineer\nWas always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife ah and ah she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed or the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a\nLobster in its own rights can you give\nMe a quick example of an engineering like solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I

motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a conservative parts and or figure out a way to make them work\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that you're forever learning how to re ... relate to people how to take into account

know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's [laughter] that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that your forever learning how to re ... relate to people how to take into account that diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case released another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation\nIt strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which every country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and\nSo I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed\nCountries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative relationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that but it is also a reality that when you trade\nSo I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed\nCountries that do trade and that have a a cooperative\nRelationship with other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors into domestic economy or will lose many again or many are better off with the with the trading relationship but that some lose in the sense that they're not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories clothes or in particular sector and ah you cannot ignore that\nI think what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic tension\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing now\n[noise] what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for a government sent for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are ... are they have a role of course but the minor\nIn this structural change and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric so it's easy to think of what's the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discuss\nChange and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what's the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand the situation and reached the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\n... there is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so\nThere will be a need to rethink the whole educational system or in countries how to support the displaced are people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how old are you will help them\nThere is no quick fix for this this

wouldn't say that my pop economics was through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economists uh which one was definitely call mark [noise]\nThat's Mary Annette ...

board offered Jeremy I'm ...\nAnd I resigned because of Brexit\nIt's sheer special advisor to the secretary general of the CDs that right yeah so the city is\nCurrently rethinking its economic narrative and so they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that a\nGotcha and also um citrus advisory panel in Finland is that true\nOh yeah I didn't realize when as a whole and yes\nThere's actually even like thirty more\nHow can it be that one university economist has the ear of so many governments and institutions\nFor a

and institutions\nFor a clue let's get back to why ... found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nThing that's fascinating about mark says that he's known as a critic of capitalism but\nActually when you read capital volume one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic\nOf capitalism which is technological change we shouldn't forget that ... was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is affect the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of law that is constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution\nAnd consumption work and marks really talks about that so it's quite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic of always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological change\nA hundred years of inertia one of the defining features of capitalism is in fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of laws that is constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution\nAnd consumption work and marks really talks about that so it's quite curious that one of the you

free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nFirst is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFree from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so what I\nGood and governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nThe first is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a

the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or form an active a visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the states with ... and almost everything a in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but the role that public actress played was really across the whole innovation

state was involved in almost everything in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but the role that public

agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream doing applied research\nLike a DARPA but also its sister organization in more recent times called art they eat the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nOn search in high risk a research\nSome evidence of the

the vast majority of all new drugs approved by the CIA [noise]\nPublic institutions have absolutely co created value it's quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the ...\nAh that one uses so instead of saying the public sector do you risk the private sector is actually about sharing risks\nThe majority of all new drugs approved by the CIA [noise]\nThese public institutions have absolutely co created value it's quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the vocabulary\nA that one uses so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating an enabling business it's really about taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and causes that government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in return how big of a problem is that\nIt's a huge problem and it comes back how we talk about things I also remind people um you know the Plato or said that story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we tell\nAbout who creates value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home the U.S government after the crisis\nShare in the return how big of a problem is that\nSo it's a huge problem and it comes back probably talk about things I often remind people um you know that play into a sad story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we tell\nAbout who creates value has them ... created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home\nThe U.S government after the
