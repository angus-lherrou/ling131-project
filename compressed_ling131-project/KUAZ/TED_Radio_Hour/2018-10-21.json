[noise]\n[noise] Barry Lynn started out as journal I worked in Venezuela and in Peru as a foreign correspondent\nAnd then after that I rent a magazine called global business magazine we should say it was a pro business magazine we were a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses so we had a real inside look at how global positioning actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation\nWe're a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses so we had a real inside look at a ... actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated\nThis was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got the work going and we did it ah with increasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty sixteen we had a number of folks on the hill starting to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and are the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem today in America competition is dying\nPerson who sort of really reached out and said I Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem today in America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problems and it's a series of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms that lots of companies depend on for survival but Google apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with that small companies so that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is it's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power\nThat leads to concentrations of wealth and concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nCompete with a small companies so that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is it's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power\nThat leaves two concentrations of wealth and concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market and do but also its parent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies and risk of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who's now president and CEO of New America\nConvinced me to leave Princeton and and become head of New America which was a big move 'cause I had a a wonderful position at at Princeton\nOr was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debates about our future and the digital age\nBut as Barry Lynn tells the story New America\nConvinced me to leave Princeton and and become head of New America which was a big move 'cause I had a a wonderful position at at Princeton\nOr was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debates about our future and the digital age\nBut as Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America we are not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing some of our attention on the platform monopolies and especially on Google\nWas wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the question is if it was um\nWas new our work a new American problematic for Google Google ... of Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the board at Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as

question is why is um [noise]\nWas ... hour work at New America problematic for Google Google ... uh Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the board at Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years he stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation suited Google itself between Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this is a relationship that goes back to the very early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a

this point\nNow it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination\nEuropean antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website it congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nWe release this statement and supportive of the decision in Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty ninth I was told that my entire team had to leave",
