debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious times in the ... great at anything\nYou need both talent in lots of each but even that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success and leaving Bernie failure it's what you might call

true for me like I can go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happen that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThat should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning

positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be that should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprised to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star\nYes you know ... and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete you're going to be the best get on your teams\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we prefer\nI've played every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always ... uh and I actually enjoy playing basketball more ah I played backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son\nThat boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we'd been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and beach volleyball\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar the athletes they both come from very athletic family\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shifting who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is ... extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgeries and hands surgeries and next\nThe gold medals in ...\nOh man well my ... my life is literally been family and sports like

who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is ... extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgeries and hand surgeries and neck surgeries and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up\nAnd the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson\nHe was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he a race NATO acts I mean everything\nHow powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas\nDonald a is about six\nTo um ... ... a\n... guy\n... is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas\nDonald or is about six to um lean a\n... guy\nOkay but what if you are a young athlete or the parents have one\nIn your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athlete but rather to get into an elite universities like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that's ... my freakonomics friend and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nMy calculation about point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I still do that\nProblem that Steve ... my freakonomics friend and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nBy my calculation about point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools and so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the universe if things you'd you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nOkay now you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave fencing thing the only exception be my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says ... soil and there's male female fencing\nAnd given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you sensors\nHaving a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten have a fencing team the only exception be my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blades says ... soil and there's male female fancy\nEnd given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever try to be sensors end up being college ... about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit thing fencing increases your chances from that point four percent baseline\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else costs than something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would still need to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school forget about soccer\nNumber holding everything else cuts and something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would still need to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nGod if you want to go to an Ivy League school forget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like\nThree hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder\nSo how many of your kids have you turned into sensors limit\nIce actually won and us so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences at a really good club in Chicago\nAnd I don't know his grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know as everyone else knows if he's going to go to\nKids have you turned to defense or is it exactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned them into a ... uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences at a really good club in Chicago\nAnd I don't know is grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know with everybody else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to because of fencing\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played at Kentucky\nOr do you would have been a topic and the drought\nThe problem was he played at Harvard we'll be right

for that ...\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunity is whether to bad luck\nBore through something much more concrete like lack of money over the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year and a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about and\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIt's a tournament in California this week of the next week and you go to Nevada after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics the last like ten

level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford\nFor him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play them I think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment or you name it over time it's starting to pirates off out as some income inequality just creates\nBetter baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance\nHuge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one it was
