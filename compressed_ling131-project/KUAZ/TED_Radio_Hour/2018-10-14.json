about running for mayor much less being there\nWhich as you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way of enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well voters are funny animals

Bloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other news sites to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven or he asked me to join him in city

and all you know it's a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't want to go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today a CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nMission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by

summer Olympics to New York city and Utah soiled first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because you thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you got delayed he wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursued you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a sin\nJudge over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because you thought it would curtail your

pursued you pursued you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed and then ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it

past\nAs to how they use the deadlines of the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city so Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite a science of what kind of region will benefit from\nIt all depends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things

thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive region owning done in time et cetera et cetera\nNow the second question you asked was or we better off having now one and there I think the answer is no because I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more stuff\nDone for ... subway today if we constantly well right now\nI think that might have had a real impact right we could have argued look all these people are coming I think it could have been a deadline to getting for example congestion pricing done but at the end of the day you know much of

Stephen ...\nDamn doctor off started whose New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York then joined the Bloomberg administration to help New York recover from the nine eleven attack who then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists\nToday one of his projects at the moment is a new

cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr off is chairman of president [noise]\nShed I was just curious about the the why ... why\nDid New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts beans at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this area on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution\nWe set to standards for one that should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nChelsea and the core of it was to save the high line the second part was to uh build what's called Hudson Yards which is this\nArea on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for one it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard because there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York and\nSecondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem that let us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible both pro grammatically a and physically\nRace so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer something yes it's exactly\nRight it's like a transformers really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth or what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time and the c._e._o.\nAnd one that would be the most flexible but pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer or something else\nIt's exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters [noise]\nFrom what I can gather the shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage the big city like New York that's\nA great way of saying you know another way of expressing as cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture or whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you you\nThe juice and leverage of the big city like New York\nThat's a great way of saying you know another way of expressing as cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital\nMight be some ground rules et cetera that enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends begin to change\nI think that is a very different notion of a cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors the high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling\nPatients on to it as taste technologies trends begin to change I think that is a very different notion of cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me and\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble as the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent on ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line\n... is the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us what's really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and amenity\nI Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard\nI I Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard um and just getting anything done often takes extraordinary effort\nOr but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you in the Bloomberg administration\nNothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that what we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave that using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system\nAnd basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nView was that financial incentives or to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot\nOn the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system and basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nView was that financial incentives uh to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been to bribe companies to stay or bribe companies to come ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user and so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped instead\nStructures in great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world you know it was sort of this optimistic sense that produces incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that most places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became [noise]\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the

cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know you know how hard it is

number of novels including everything is limited and I got a younger brother named Josh who is a science writer who wrote a book called moon walking\nWith Weinstein and it's actually\nIncredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because ah I'm sure it in some ways we benefit from the novelty active being\nThree brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her own accomplishments right but I you know our parents didn't do anything they didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day and or or sit down and study the great

and or or sit down and study the great chess masters [laughter] we watched a lot of he man\nAn Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut one of the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to spend essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card at will at the bookshop\nAnd so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in journalism was slate one of the very first mainstream online publications would just start by Microsoft\nAnd so there was a huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes there was a certain amount of utopian ism associated with the emergence of the

an incredibly elitist Oregon and managed to persist over a hundred years well never really turning a profit and so\nAs we entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing to continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next\nAnd I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up resigning his editor\nBut then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard\nAnd co founder of Facebook and he bought the magazine and to me this seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media\nWho had incredible number of resources and seemed to vote\nKind of sick of that I ended up resigning
