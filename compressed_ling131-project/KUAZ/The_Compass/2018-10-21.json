far too long to diagnose disease and responses appropriate the there was a school of economics that that could you tell us how to handle the crisis as old fashioned games in economics\nAnd a number of people made that point event or people recommend that fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession\nThey weren't using the frontier economics or the kind that gets stores and graduate schools they are using stuff that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so did you get onto the surgeries they're rather better than the economy of the eighties nineties and the early to

London a top rated economics departments\nShe saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class what we're seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the

close ... there were seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right they were not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions of the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raised\nThat the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can

retrospect she admits these books ... subjects but we usually important in terms of understanding the crush\nThings as basic as how find them works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're\nAddressing particular issues in the macro economy so the the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no

lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics was taught in universities around the world and has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate I'm going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and the teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others

fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest Alison\nSo at Stanford University with us\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge inferior and seeing what people want to hear well turning a blind on the bond even criminal behavior by buying cars but compression financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking they remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end\nIgnoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment that's an entirely unnecessary it's just taken is given it's just what they accept the system\nAnd don't you think this is changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more about you know very shockingly\nYou know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible the regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think that the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff\nHappens then you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible like this before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can prevent it stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recall them is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nWere blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own

citizens as been at the center of you might say conservative economics since Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith that conservatives I'd\nMiss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained\nWhy markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things in the self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off just\nBeing in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work

Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at any doctor needed their students that markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect shooting\nAnd the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at any doctor needed their students that markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expects humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were a science and not only works if you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted\nJournalists country muscles book who cooked Smith spinner argues the traditional economic theories and methods only makes

calculating brain that is always acting out of self interest and all of those sort of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more obvious is sort of all the characteristics that economics goes to great lengths trying to exclude from these models like emotions family the faulty feelings compassion and altruism\nAnd all of these things that we have been told that these are not economically relevant these are not anything that we need to studying economics there's like ... the same things that we have been torched view as female\nAnd opens the off to
