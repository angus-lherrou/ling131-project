perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody know something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were
