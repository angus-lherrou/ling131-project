guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dash cam video ... large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune I've been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life who are connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nVerdict we find guilty of murder [noise] we find that at the end of aggravated\nWith fire [noise] first\nEasiest Gen Y is host of the podcast sixteen

easiest Gen Y is host of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming release um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting with climate Donald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street\nFatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense that this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are there people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the ... the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWell we'll just have some of the riveting moments of the trial\nThink the big moment of course when ... when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on [noise]\nThis is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWell we'll just have some of the

wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of late

mentioned in ... report it on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these reps or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released of this shooting\nThe department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd so and talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case\nThat we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what is reform look like you know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent\nEspecially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say\nThis is one case that we think some degree of justice was done\nBut when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform looked like you know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but isn't going to be effective because there have been promises in the past\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for them to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's going to happen from here\n[noise] ... she's the host of sixteen shots that's a podcast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been
