courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd while you've probably heard about the federalist society Israel and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and signed something of a loyalty oath New York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now

law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and sign something of a loyalty oath\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us and it's good to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar but there was something problematic about\nThe people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic\nDid in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar but there was something problematic about\nRequiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for an open to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just sticking to that event like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts a kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above\nIn the words of some legal experts a kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties on to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\n... ... it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice that yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably\nAn affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo they're all kinds of groups that exist you create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create pipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they've been particularly intentional\nNot a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create\nPipelines fraternities sororities they all kind of create pipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to\nWho can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine\nBut also to make them make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not fine\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when your piece published online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close mouthed about it I tried them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to say who was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee\nThey wouldn't say who those donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nTo try them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their material said a generous donors were making use significant financial investment in each and every attendee\nThey wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThey just issued a brief blends statements saying they were reevaluating\nWhich suggests that perhaps they might try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely
