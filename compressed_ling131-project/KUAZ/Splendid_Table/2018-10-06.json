do a lot of other things that make you know life complete\nThing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is a trap the scarcity trap for us is\nAll the ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to\nMake friends justice the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the friends they do not have the result is they try too hard to be like\nWhich leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do here's another example we think the lonely do this so people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJustice to poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be locked in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to watch actually being set the

asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty make everyone less capable that it's the\nIt's it's you and I tomorrow what are we to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect the poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some bleeding Haass theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and out in ... wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when the rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nMonth after they get that income they're pretty rich\nShould have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich so how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once that money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the ... on the long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched\nOther research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to\nMeant and rich the next central and now that are tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read their feels more regularly then farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely
