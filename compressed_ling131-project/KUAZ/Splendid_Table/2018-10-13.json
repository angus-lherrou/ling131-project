think storms droughts and earthquakes must have a mind of their own\nGeneral tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do\nTurns

happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random event some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have in mind behind that\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWe found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable like you couldn't anticipate its actions\nThat's when people described it reported that have had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance and I don't think\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWe found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable\nLike you couldn't anticipates its actions\nThat's when people described it reported that it had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance of billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls off and the predicted direction where you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain and in these cases\nSometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there's a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute in mind or something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain\nWhat's going on in this uh autonomous and this autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an agent behave somewhat unpredictably\nWas over at a friend's house and uh

bottom of the pool and\nI find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next makes it just more interesting and more I live in a way than something that moves into very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well\nNow it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly ... start to get a little sense of a mind that people are crazy you don't you don't think it's like your mother\nIt's more interesting and more I live in a way than something that moves into very predictable

don't\nYou don't think it's like your mother writer or your your your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming or the living room but it starts to look just a little bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people\nActually do name their room but as you can buy outfits to dress it up\nOr if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of\nPeople thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nWant to talk to you a little bit about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stop and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like\nPeople thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nI Want to talk to a little bit about the subject of coincidences and

the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happened it was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise]\nThis is what underwater room does have to do what two incidents is like a robot that does something unexpected coincidences crowd for meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we stopped to seek patterns even when they aren't any\nFavorite example of this in the world of psychology is actually phenomena\nInvolve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise]\nThis is what underwater ... how to do what coincidences [noise] like a robot that does something unexpected coincidences crowd for meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we start to see patterns even when there aren't any\nMy favorite example of this in the world of psychology is actually phenomena first documented by my PHD advisor Tom Gilovich\nAnd a brilliant psychologist Amos diversity is the illusion of the hot hand in faster [noise]\nThe study something called implicit

but stay\nMontgomery College in Maryland piece study something called implicit eco tourism which\nIs the idea that many biopsies are unconscious and one very well studied biased was you get to some value in the self favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there's several different things that at least to some degree reflect a preference for the self and attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo of your name\nWe originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great direct rays of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on his paper and now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer\nGravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brett looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forties senses to examine if they were ...\nName able who was able to document that was a review on his paper\nAnd now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something\nHe was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brett looked at a massive\nDatabase of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forties senses to examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as butchers miners working as minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every\nSurname there is a currently the top two thousands are names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're Lebanon's them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a\nI think it was a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from family\nYou and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a I think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from families who are in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both names and the choices\nQuite possibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations\nThere's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did in a fifty percent chance that he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter marriage is a guy named farmer for example that that's really it it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent elements looked at large data\nProbably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old and they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter ... county farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near the magnitude\n\nRent Palin has looked at large data sets and public records like the Social Security death index or state marriage\nRecords databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny affects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as uncommon as you might think\nBeyond what you might expect by chance and there's about a seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that or if that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them tested eco terrorism as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shape what everyone does all the time\nBut it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these small effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start\nBeyond what you might expect by me a chance there's about seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that or if that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them ... as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shave for everyone does all the time\nBut it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these smaller effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nRead says that if you really love your butt day the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so have you got married on the thirteenth of the month you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday number\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names and our butts days and have positive associations with them\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that uh and the the best bit of evidence I have but I've never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's\nThis an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with that\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that and uh and the the best bit of evidence I have but I've never bothered to publish is there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle names you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble and my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer Sunday right for the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same but day if you were born on April twentieth\nYou might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to read finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] as

there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was ... [noise] my name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as ... and I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that it'd be very interesting and the fact that Shankar top that philosophy\nI thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you say this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit eagle\nTo read his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in your jak decision\nAt the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you Brett do you ever seen\nI've always been drawn to the fact that I find the philosophy of downtown it'll be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy I thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you say this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit he can\nRead his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in the objectively good decision\nAt the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself and you go to them is affecting we're getting a little personal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic examples that my son Matthew\nI'm his his last things Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lesson as Pelham\nAnd I enjoyed her relationship with her before I developed this not after I developed a theory to validate the so Europe ... and you got into a relationship with a woman named pulled and holding\nAnd we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have to think it did I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um\nDifferent religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her and it works\nThis is not after I developed the theory to validate the so so your column and you got into a relationship with a woman named pulled in Poland\nAnd we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as also ... are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have to think that I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um\nDifferent religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nAt a worse yes she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter]\nI said I and I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while\nThere is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see\nYou you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world or the unconscious mind for the last ten years I have the sense that my choices I deliberate choices that I've thought about them I've actually\nI'm making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they had these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself and he's a disturbing idea it is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I did which has said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias\nI have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious

from even our own findings\nBut I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough of the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure exactly why I did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea\nBut I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know what why and do what I Do I mean there's just too much research and much of which you documented in reporting on that show that buys these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began to study it the serving as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n\nDo I mean there's just too much research and much of what
