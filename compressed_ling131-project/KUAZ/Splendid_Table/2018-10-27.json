and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within median annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then the top the professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income\nUm and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the

it shows that that can I needed to keep close to home in a small circle of friends and acquaintances who knew no she's not just the guy who sells toilets his social on her is not

and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic

um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty or straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drugs sex rock and roll\nUm didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] Mm\nSays working class people have come to a shoe but government benefits and government programs are not for them\nTheir nose clean keeping on the straight and

like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they\nDeliver it to help and they deliver it quite

and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption you know it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the ... end of the political elites\nTo make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book is that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan in their outlook and people who are not\nAlso they're going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to the community in a way that's very different\nAnd in some ways they resent the people who will cost a politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas\nThe U.S who are routed to the community in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who are costs will politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThe twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third\nThe people who voted both for ... and for Trump where those people who were left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever day actually social science studies show\nHundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted both for brags it and for Trump where those people who are left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people\nWho have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever they actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity\nIn contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange does your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display but it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work it's what you do to support your family\nWork uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the extremes that your husband had with his former classmate in some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes the it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a form of saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work it's what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie\nUm this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks\nThat you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie\nI'm just total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite\nMany people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of sort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\n\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many residue people believed that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out on the book Joan this idea is much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nTo college is

two thousand the United states is absorbed in extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways in will be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California Texas we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you pointed out account for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the shores off the friction intense\nOf whom are immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you pointed out account for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's at the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nFor the average American voter or you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected we'd walk polls show Marissa half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants or a burden to us society and it's like majority things Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nIt's a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely

demographic shift you also have these increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxieties of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really\nTaken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central
