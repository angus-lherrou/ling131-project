long distances at a fast as possible sprint pace how come up ... let us do that\nWe have in the body is essentially two systems of energy delivery so we have aerobic metabolism which is using molecular oxygen from the atmosphere we didn't have any robot metabolism which all energy transfer process is not involving oxygen\nLet's say you could sprint for American the American world record with them be Seventeen minutes rather than just over a hundred and twenty minutes\nAnd the reason the body can't do that is because you channel supply that energy rapidly enough using the aerobics system\nAerobic metabolism is quite slow whereas Arabic metabolism is extremely fast you know your classic Arabic events that a hundred meters two hundred meters four hundred meters anything above that it's the aerobic system the predominant is there a speed limit\nBritain for America and the American world record would then be Seventeen minutes rather than just over a hundred and twenty
