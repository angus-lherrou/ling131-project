Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator\nAnd a former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida ... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson is facing an ... guy\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can be as far as I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on\nDemocrats tell me that you know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign huh in terms of just being visible and

told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning but who governor for the election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had her she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's at a change of heart in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane but\nHe's shown me he's working from ... to his show me what you do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote use in Florida yet still up you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually

... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nAnd and the debate is your plan out was being hosted by the local Telemundo\nBroke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate as you point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station he was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there\nThere were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott being this hardliner on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill Nelson really just wants to have open borders\nOne of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that is really the case here in Florida as well because this was not\nShe effected a number of Floridians the other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hard line on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have\nOpen borders ... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum similar trends but similar voters throughout the country\nThat is really the case here in Florida as well because this is not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican\nOperative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr he's lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum\nHe said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and it was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line or a ... and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most\nFifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country\nThe Arab but that's a shift the reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum\nHe said that if this is an election or that energy that's where the energy is and it was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line right and and since it's Florida I think we can be
