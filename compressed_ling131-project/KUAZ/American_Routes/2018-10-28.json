trends Democrats really do have the wind at their backs let's walk through why exactly that is when presidents are in their first midterms they lose a heck of a lot of seats on average\nIs just as a matter of and we've heard President Trump actually posit publicly why that is\nNot a good job wise [noise]\nTo do it frankly with the fact that people got their guy over the line they got their president and then they sort of a back off and the ... perhaps the content in the settled in and the people who are most motivated or the people who are most upset with the policies that the new president is putting in place\nFun facts on that ...

that\nWhen the president's approval rating going into the midterms is below fifty percent and Trump's according to our latest poll is thirty nine percent the president's party averages a loss of thirty seven seats in the house which by the way Democrats need fewer than that in order to take the house so when the president has approval of over fifty percent\nHis party tends to lose only fourteen seat still last but not nearly as huge\nOne Democrats have been incredibly enthusiastic all year ever since President Trump took office but in recent weeks we've seen Republicans finally getting engaged getting enthusiastic as well\nYeah and as you get closer to the election that tends to happen and Republicans the advantage that they wind up having is is a there are couple advantages that Republicans have\nSeen Republicans finally getting engaged getting enthusiastic as well yeah and as you get closer to the election that tends to happen and Republicans the advantage that they wind up having is is there a couple of advantages that Republicans have\nKevin Abrams have sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the election comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because of the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registration that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nAnd this has drawn a federal lawsuit a temp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams end of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot

up applications there are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as complex to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular race has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning out of the Georgia flag back in the nineties at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia for deeply disturbed by the racial divisions ness\nAn issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently that looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning of the Georgia flag back in the nineties that the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbols\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nDominican this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell you know Georgia is one of those states that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left\nYears have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much

moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal\nBut ... has done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way but she's just too extreme for George eight\nDays even he could be spending tax rating liberal she's in extreme cases campaign\nClear it's concise people can understand what he's getting at their Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my\nThe first African American female governor is a big deal but campaigns done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nFacing even he could just be spending ... liberal she's in extreme cases campaign\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting at their Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with Ken and so my big question is you know everyone talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters in the same way that Obama did in two thousand eight Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand ... he lost by about two hundred thousand votes\nSo that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climate she's going to win this race\nAnd we will have answers to

lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans this new poll this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nWell it looks like essentially that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans has kind of faded to be perfectly honest or it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something that I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example\nThe vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pool and the numbers a Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor\nKind of faded to be perfectly honest or it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something that I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example the vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pool and the numbers are Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in people's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November six\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nThat the twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around and say that they are motivated to go vote for Democrats because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican\nSo I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this is about me get trying to get his supporters of the polls but this result shows that this\nThat ... bomber was a factor in their vote\nAs a twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around and say that they are motivated to go vote for Democrats because of their impressions of President Trump\nThan in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican so I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this was about me trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this was a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking too though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corners Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote your fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide then you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for Democrats thirty three percent of independent men say that so\nInteresting gender gaps on this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote your fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide then you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make me vote for a Democrat thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this is important this year\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential this year across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic men and democratic women alike dislike Trump and are going to vote Democrat\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks about independents they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and the gamble here among Republicans in a lot of Republicans I talked to was they said look independents young voters Latinos\nYou know they don't turn out to vote as much in mid term year so you know if the goal is to you\nTrump and are going to vote Democrat yeah I mean when Daniel talks about independents they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about\nAnd the gamble here among Republicans and a lot of Republicans I talked to was they said look independence young voters Latinos\nYou know they don't turn out to vote as much in the midterm year so you know if the goal is to drive up the base and this is going to be a base election which is the gamble then they need to fire up the Republican base with a lot of these cultural issues\nStitching together all these different programs that kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money put into all of these programs that it's\nPeriod where we are both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together people saying look what we need here is to back up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just\nStitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem is we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can\nIf we can only agree on that

going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or have tried to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads\nCome down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration\nScott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and made a pie\nUndermine the Affordable CARE Act corrupt try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads come down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration Scott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people uh but could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places\nAnd then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of been an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace\nWhich despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign ups has stayed pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in and the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One\nPremiums on the a C a marketplaces\nAnd then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of been an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace\nWhich despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate building didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOf the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative cell in South voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace bill that they'll what has done away with your protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks in an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with pre\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative so unsettled voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace bill that bill would have done away with your protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks\nIn an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nThat's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions including the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year oh democratic ads yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project\nAt that point now we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions including the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year oh democratic ads yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks these things\nHere's how in building Democrats feel this year that's compared to from twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nAt the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nTwo of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying\nOh I definitely would protect people with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act earlier this year\nGeneral who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nTwo of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying\nOh I definitely would protect people with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE
