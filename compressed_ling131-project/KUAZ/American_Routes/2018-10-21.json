September just after the summer when everyone started tipping where people were starting to look at Arizona Tennessee Texas all my goodness everyone wants to talk about the Texas senator yeah this is the right to do right well you know some of that has fallen back to political gravity and political reality\nYou know a lot of people will get to the cabinet confirmation battle and the fact that

battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular\nAnd to me what's been the interesting thing about this cycle is that those dreams have gone away that yes there was that blip of democratic hopefulness and the fall that oh maybe they could pick up a couple and hold their own everywhere and maybe even the perennial pipe dream of Texas\nCame up again but now we're back to where we were and Republicans are doing worse I think in the Senate battleground than they should be given the map and given the great economy that they've got\nWe've entered that final few weeks of an election that's kind of the dark side of the moon where there's not many from data points but suddenly you see wild shift in how a political observers view things the Democrats might be fine after all the Democrats might be totally screwed [laughter] I I think it's just hard to tell especially in\nThe great economy that they've got\nWe've entered that final few weeks of an election that's

and it feels like every week there is one major news story that dominates the headlines and because of that other important story is often get overlooked\nWe dive into one story this week that did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving Tehran to to be with us from around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week as White House counsel why don't you start by just explaining\nWhat his job was and why it matters that he left\nBare bones of these you already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all\nDive into one trying to sneak they did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week as White House counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise and white matter is that he left\nThe bare bones of these he is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House Don McGahn is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney pets baloney\nWho is well known in Republican legal circles but while Siblani is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay and Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of this field Harry\nFor another couple of weeks the acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay an Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly working on outside investigations\nAnd he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of the Senate this field Harry inside already to me right in terms of who's who and who they all watch for and and it sounds sort of like we're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in up pretty high powered job that\nThat maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that a fair assessment\nIt is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and the gun was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to it\nKind of story ought to be heard and when we need to think about it and was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that it's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court and appeals court levels all over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nReading it take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier I mean that Robert Mueller and McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right yes indeed he did\nAnd that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible\nUh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump\nI sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed he did and that was apparently

Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of than twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood he has been\nHandling much um the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nAnd do you want to ask you though about the job itself did that again represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nSays the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that ambiguity\nDid that again represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what does he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that ambiguity which has really been with us for very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the presidency of the

a race relations and any number of other things to be real clear just and one thing that you mentioned Kerry is that she is in Russia\nSo uh it's not as if the United States Department of justice can force her to come to the U.S and and some will have a trial right I mean what does this mean that they've charged her\nThis is part of an ongoing naming and shaming operation the Justice Department

H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here [noise]\nYou mean you could start with you can you know it's just a lay of the land start with the basics of who\nIs running with a Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare and won support from House Republicans of course didn't become law\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here you mean you can start with you can you know it's just a re a veranda start with the basics of who\nIs running well the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that he's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on national security council\nAnd Joe you been there on the ground in the district touch with a little bit about what it's like\nBoth of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but MacArthur is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money\nAll across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but MacArthur is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it was a little bit more detail about who lived in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kind of goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so\nIt's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThe Republican in the race ... had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter that I mean give me a little bit about why Democrats see this as\nAll the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter this\nI mean given her talk to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort and this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that goes\nAnd Joe is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country but I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it kind of playing out in a really intense way\nAnd Joe is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country but I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it's kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment\nTo the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really what had changed the current health care structure\nJoe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nKnow stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats\nAllowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip\nFrom twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it in their favor\nAs the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those were pro AC a and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nRelated that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nOr
