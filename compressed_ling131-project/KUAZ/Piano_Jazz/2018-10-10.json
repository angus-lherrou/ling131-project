how do you get young people to come out to vote when you say\nWell I think first of all you have to let them know that number one their vote counts um you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about more than just the sport that basically\nWe all athletes that you were talking to\nYou have to ... it was all Applebee's okay I'm a I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform and in the right way but more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a drink a lot of times\nThe state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that really affect you ate today like\nI Hope everybody staying safe down there now you have been active across a

affect you ate today like\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there\nNow you've been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players at this was urging President Trump to use his clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask him that currently basic question that that would just things like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power has to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from an effort but I Do think you'd want to hear from the players who are everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we are not affected by the law of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete activists also citing social injustice\nI mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from an afro but I Do think you want to hear from the players who aren't everyday citizens just because we're

towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want to be unrealistic and after the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people who tried to deny what's really going on in our society and I think if I had our way\nEverybody with the things that were asked you to see that there is a specific group of people in our country that's not treated fairly\nAnd I would be for everybody to see that and for everybody to work together and come up with solutions to try to rectify that\nDo you support the rate of current players to take any during the anthem\nOf course if I think for me in the NFL is a peaceful protests when I'm outside of the protests\nAnd our way everybody would you see that there is a specific group of people in our
