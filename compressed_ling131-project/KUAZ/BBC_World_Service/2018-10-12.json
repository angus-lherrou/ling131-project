released yesterday by ... public uh and time magazine\nThe organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called West Point when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier who was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often than managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many

and the end but many other names are given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charging talking\nYou know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh wants one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role\nIn the crimes that that the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care\nSo when the rates came to light the organization essentially said that this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mind into organizations who died an intimate relationship with find or they didn't acknowledge

context may have contributed to his ability to access to abused young girl they mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so\nWhat we know is it to students who are named essence victim spot denied it tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school\nThat is well the challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there

what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continued to operate just generally there'll be an any change as a tool to make it hard to fool the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's certainly true that the organization\nSought to to strengthen its policies and sought to improve its hiring practices and implemented a whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the

exporting a a ... hobby religious ideology which was encouraging danger\nThere's actually taking place in the country when you can't do that I wouldn't call actually fault\nLet's return Nick buttons

deep concern\nAbout the degree to which Saudi Arabia was exporting a a ... hobby religious ideology which was\nEncouraging dangerous extremism and many other parts of the world where Saudi resources were being invested in mosques and ma dresses and what have you\nAnd NBS addressed all of this and he said the Bloomberg just a few months ago he said look we are trying to get rid of extremism and

sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been\nIn the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen Seventy to the Iranian Revolution the Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly but Israel now enjoys the best relationship\nPolitical foreign policy intelligence that they've ever had\nAnd so you've seen these substantial changes under Mohammed bin Salman but at the same time Steve and I think that there's growing impatience and now outright anger in both of our political parties in Washington and inside the Trump Administration over what appears to be an entirely reckless inhumane\nBeef steel act by the Saudi Government to kill one of his own critics you couple that\nWith the the problem with the Saudis have cause any ... by prosecuting this ill considered very violent war\nTo the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move are interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures in the last year the

percent of all us ... balls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether your belief\nThat the Congress for example is now going to ask really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia\nIs really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but I Do think two things may happen\nOne is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom of insolvent because as you know uh

update from London [noise]\n\nThis is Dan Damon with wild update there's no counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics in the early years of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of besides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them and from the University of cancer brand new Zealand after most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nThe prize in our all of that is that as you say we expect herbicides ...\nThe effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of herbicides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them an from the University of counter brand new Zealand to most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill the weeds and antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of this is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria proceed both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the ... the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you'll get a sub lethal affect the bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that remove all those toxins from inside themselves\nThe bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you get a sub lethal affect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapts the bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so that herbicides in a sense of vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is on the way the most harmless of sounding places anyway ... thanks loans where people played with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together in these places because for example you might\nUse herbicides on your lawn your cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn what

antibiotics may come together and they come together in these places because for example you might\nUse herbicides on your lawn your cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn walk back into someone's house where there is stroked that puts her side an application levels on their hands and they made touched their mouths\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria in these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the war\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria in these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that asks these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to some leads the levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us into\nPossibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemicals\nCan you imagine a post antibiotic era\nCan imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image the post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the hope of new antibiotics\nThat's that could inform us and to\nPossibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemical\nCan you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image\nThe post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the help of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the fuel yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful to us in the future\nProfessor jak hind them in more than a million people were
