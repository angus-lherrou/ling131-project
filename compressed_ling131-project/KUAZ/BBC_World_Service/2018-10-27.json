Ashraf are our guests here on weekend\nLet's focus on this now because each day the political divide in America\nVery many people in your native United States like the fact that democracy helped elect the President Trump and I think that he's finding that Qunu\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy so the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances that make sure that what the people\nThen when you get threats to democracy well\nVery many people in your native United States like the fact that democracy helped elect President Trump and they think that he's fighting neck outta\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy\nSo the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances that make sure that what the people choose doesn't churn eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power\nAnd that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people vote in a way that you would approve of\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the\nDepriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us\nWhat linked D.C between demanding dignity an identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this\nChecks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity an identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have\nThat we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized\nAnd that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nA dignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years\nYou recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you\nKnow so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are uh she said yes it does it says that it's the people\nThe ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of politics in the world over the last couple of hundred years\nYou recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump\nDidn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that National Community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nWill be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil dining hungry who you mentioned in your book and like the alternatives that Germany movement that you will send mention\nOf this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that passionate community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know I was born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this was really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like Viktor Orban hungry who you mentioned in your book\nI'm like the alternatives to Germany movement that you will send mentioned that will be loads of people who who who listen to you and think\nWhat Californians view you know what a liberal Californian view your day Nate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and go to all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people uh you know that er\nThe biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people uh you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions\nAnd integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\nA and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say are you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it it is to find Chrissy an action\nPlace or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that's democracy if black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is democracy in action and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI hits I'm the Justice Department and I think that if she\nGets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now\nAnd I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts and the ...\nRussia it's the FBI it's um the Justice Department and I think that if he gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now\nAnd I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts him dependence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity the demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nIt's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk about democracy and I think it's in some ways ... democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nBut what we've got in the middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same set a sentence\nSaying we're not comfortable with the extremes but what we've got in the middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together on work against each other in the same in the same sort of sentence\nSo identity politics is really saw shifting sons in terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme and people gravitate towards the middle where we find\nUnhappiness with it and therefore won't to effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become uncomfortable then we moved to the middle so that ... that constant broadening motion effectively in politics is really interesting\nDo you have political beliefs so based on your identity I'm not sure I Do a show my identity is it's a multi faceted and so my political beliefs but I think this issue here is is really I'm very ...\nFor ... say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become uncomfortable when we moved to the middle so that how much in isolation and that constant brightening motion effectively in politics is really interesting\nDo you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show up my identity is a it's a multifaceted and so my political beliefs but I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think France is so key albums ... started the debate which I Hope will be grab by people more widely [noise]\nOne of the assumptions as being that

and the ... and it is these these people that are hardest by extremists politicians who are anti democratic and in the longer term\nSo we do have a a big issue here\nWhich does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics\nIt needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and prosper in a democratic system otherwise it's very fragile one problem assume we're wrapping up the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the band or which\nDemocratic it's in the longer term so we do have a a big issue here\nWhich does need to be addressed

doing other things that are also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries
