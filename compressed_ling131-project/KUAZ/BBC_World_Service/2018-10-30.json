gonna say if I may and there is relatively little difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other\nOn in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have an

the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerge and be very distinctive is among those people who identify with neither party I'm independent women are very different from
