add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other\nStuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end the atmosphere is one big heat edge and it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy at one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere\nFrom every other so if you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power winter but makes and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end the atmosphere is one big heat edge in it's driven by power from the sun and that power is always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation of energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite you know come into most a\nA very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequences at that point three percent is almost irrelevant but it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nJust a patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum and that in turn can\nEvaporated water so that direct consequences at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut

winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat in momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind some might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because this mole solar energy coming through this because you don't get a cooling effect does a grant from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere and especially at night when the atmosphere\nLarge wind farms warms up and that's\nBecause this mole solar energy coming

but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yes how much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit if it's weak king but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region where large wind farms are\nSeem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that but the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so wind turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to ... energy system this is all about choices we make\nBut if it's weak king but that wouldn't be with

issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so wind turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to be carbon us energy system this is all about choices we make as we do carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one when the phone on a global scale I don't suppose has a big effect you modeling is the last numbers of wind farms\nYeah but one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very intimate decimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduces climate change over the whole next century over the whole world\nThat one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs is just slightly venting the benefits of wind farms or want to get out to all together I don't\nThink he wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution\nDoes a very infinitesimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduces climate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs is just slightly venting the benefits of wind farms are what you know it's all together\nDon't think he wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution impacts\nAnd given the very long time scale of of seemed to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density is a winter brown and race basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number it's more like a half\nEnergy or power density is a winter brown raised basically how much power you get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer\nWe've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number it's more like a half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWell less important because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more was per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you have environmental and social impacts nothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be\nIn some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more watts per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you know have environmental and social impact\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you and the big important are finding I think is that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than the land footprint of wind for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new thoughts on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at this time on on active duty Keith climate there's a link to his papers by his blog site to borrow a Web page at BBC World service don't comb that like most scientists\nAnd in addition wind has this climate impact and these climate impacts are

as at Case Western University in Cleveland in the U.S have discovered how those tiny insects maintain that balance when apple and my colleague immediate ... ... from the leader such a I'd Sondra yoga\nMichael on a steady lead to understand how flies are able to maintain balance twelve wine and then one thing we already knew about flies was that they have these specialized tied links called ... years and years are basically to fly equivalent of your inner ear but they'd be alert system so they use them for balance\nAnd flies can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the healthcare trust lie and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control culture the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time someone did that experiment was in Seventeen fourteen I think but what we didn't know what how the hulk years actually work but\nIt's called ... and oh tears are basically the fly equivalent of your inner ear ... systems so they use them for balance and size can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the tears from a fly and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control tumbled through the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time someone did that experiment was in Seventeen fourteen I think about what we didn't know how the whole cheers actually work though what information where the whole cheers providing to the fly so in order to figure that out what I did was to record from the whole chair neurons\nAnd I found that the timing of single spikes with different when I recorded the whole tier neuron in a position that stimulated straight flight versus when I recorded while the wheelchair was in a position that simulated a fly rotating so basically\nMy data showed that flies can tell the difference between stable flight and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of the spikes coming from their hall cheering her on\nWhat they're targeting as well because they have that ability to go over at the same time that the rules of the way\nSo the ... century organs they're more reflective there on the canals sensation that sort of how you feel as opposed to vision and the reason they use these are there more reflective behavior just because it's\nTell the difference between stable flight and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of the spikes coming from their hall cheering her on\nThe boat what they're targeting as well because they have that ability to go over at the same time the girl so quick that of getting away yeah\nSo the ... century organs they're more reflective there on the canals sensation that sort of how you feel as opposed to vision and the reason they use these are there more reflective behaviors is because it's much faster than fish until it's kind of like they can immediately detect a rotation and correct it really quickly\nWhat's important about funding\nSo it's important for us because this research has shown away that complex aspects of an animal's environment can be broken down to the timing of a single spike\nSo this is our brains initially represent information in the world through single spikes and single neuron every thought an experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons and Pfizer no different just see the here to study fly because they have a lot fewer neuron than a human what [laughter]\nWhat will it mean for for humans information\nFiner than human neurons work exactly the same way so it certainly helps us to understand how different organism sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nThe world trade single spikes anything on there on every side and experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons think Pfizer no different just seem to be here to study fly because they have a lot fewer neuron than a human one\nWhat would be for for humans information\nFiner than human neurons work exactly the same way\nSo it certainly helps us to understand how different organism sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nBut there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example would be flight technology wise it had millions of years to evolve fast and efficient mechanisms for why so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same techniques to build our own bio inspired technologies\n... yoga and now before we puzzle here at the news room ... mind to all of our main news at least seven Mountain News from uh South Korea next expedition have died in a snowstorm in in
