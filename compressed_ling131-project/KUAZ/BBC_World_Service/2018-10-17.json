studio great to have you with is Ellie\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game Fortnite I don't play but I've heard of it how was it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game of dominoes again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to social cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nUm but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense we have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season ... and that's how the company generates money\nReasons it's been so successful you know it's really

it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you automatically\nSo he's been selling these modes to the game online\nAnd for a upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yet and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people who have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas and knowing for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with that is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software afford night that's right that's\nSending these molds to the game online and for a upwards of two hundred

at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software afford night\nThat's right that basically accusing these papers copyright infringement and they're saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one there surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nWell this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says there are some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think epic haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nItself is not even a first for Fortnite re vote yeah they they had some people to rest\nSome fat he says

John as midnight struck so who was selling the first batch\nTwo minutes possibly a now Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalize recreational marijuana consumption on ... a year ago I was pushed the protests began a few hours ago it was midnight struck first Newfoundland in the eastern most parts of the country to be moving\nAcross the great celebrations Chris O'Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was sending the first such\nIt's a company called called canopy growth states actually whiter a large multinational company and uh they've set up shop in St John so they will be selling it you know over the counter here\nUm there are about three locations here is in St john's area that you can walk in off the street and by the candidate but for for now for the most part\nYou'll be ordering it on line it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor and ah they brought in all the rules and regulations companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there\nAbout twenty two locations off in a in the country right now that in ... in the profit right now they can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government\nYou'll be ordering it online it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls

now that in ... in the province right now they can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government so while it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies\nHave their eye on this already and we got in first that if the big companies that already um\nThat had already set down the\nPut down roots and other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move a midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere in seems that you'll see the\nWhole I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight it's quite amazing\nSo I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities with millions of people some of them are Canadians wanted this for very long time and ah when Justin Trudeau ran to the prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of uh\nThe atmosphere and seems that you'll see a\nOh I Would I Would say some St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and seeing this excitement tonight it is quite amazing\nSo I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities with millions of people some of them are Canadians wanted this for very long time and the when Justin Trudeau ran to the prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of\nHands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers and um\nAnd regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at Canada to see what Canada is going to do because our way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done if within safe but Canada is really a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on poll it will not be without bumps and pick up\nFrom law enforcement to actually whether there's even enough marijuana that's the one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that they expect the demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of suppliers are probably\nHas done so in in a number of states and some countries have done it within safe but Canada is really a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on hold it will not be without bomb that hiccup\nFrom law enforcement to actually whether there's even a ... marijuana that's one thing we've been hearing of the last number of days that they expect that demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of the flyers are probably going to run out even within the first few days\nRight is it because it's such a stampede the basically the country's going to be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but people will have to take it and bring it home or ticket in ... so good at private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking\nThat's Chris O'Neal your eggs in St Joe Newfoundland or she was reporting there was a very ... behind a queuing up for their legal kind of his uh for the Canadian Broadcasting

because it said\nThat country had taken the project in a different strategic direction than had been agreed\nTo tell us about the significance of the scale of it how big it is it's\nHuge um I mean the idea for the Angus three is to compliment the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from ... in a fool's\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as a Jew or it's got six phases and\nWe'll take more than ten years to complete compete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred ... megawatts of power now that's about the same amount of energy\nAs three nuclear power stations China does does the are seen neater used that much power as well as it doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal is he can be expanded way beyond the ten percent\nSo this new project as well as a Jew or it's got six phases and
