tech\nThere about the science for much books and there's one on each for now when you switch them on a laser beam projects on the ground a show green line a few inches in front of each ...\nHas a guy I Try and get on and and see how the swat a size ... should I get up and I have a walk and then you can guide me as to\nWhy should be placed in them so this is who've been reading straight food safe

about ten centimeters long with a pair of few inches in front of my left\nSome quite cool and good fun to laugh but I'm Wondering how they help people who have freezing of gates happy\nSo yes so behind the solution is not just these she works closely with professor ... blue ... who is ... ... puff scientific advisor and and you wrote adjust the essence of\nA small horizontal line about ten centimeters along with a pair of few inches in front of my left foot\nSound quite cool and it's fun to laugh but I'm Wondering how they help people who have freezing of gate ...\nYes I behind the solution is not just sneeze she works closely with professor ... who is ... ... puff scientific advisor and and you're on the just\nThe essence of Parkinson's disease is that the so called automatic pilot\nUm is defective if people with Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures the paying attention to it that automatic ability is lost and people with Parkinson's\nBut you can actually literally trick the brain by by passing that automatic pilot which is more or less to start engine of the brain by consciously recruiting demoted areas of the brain so what the lasers basically do is offer an external visual trigger\nForcing or allowing that patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they ... they are defective automatic pointed\nRight okay I think I get this filthy\nTo start engine of the brain by consciously recruiting demoted areas of the brain so what the lasers basically do is offer an external visual trigger forcing are allowing the patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they bind pause there are defective automatic pointed\nRight okay I think I get this for people that have Parkinson's the automatic way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way yeah another\nReally good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues ... says that's because the status going up woods acts as a visual cue obstruction by\nPolicies that effective ... the sensory illusion of delays as ... in the same way it tricks the Brian by constantly placing a key\nAnd from out who as we had a bad idea has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets ... stations this device is pretty useful if I can\nThat's because the styles going up ... as a visual cue obstruct should buy policies that effective power for the sensory illusion of lasers walks in the same way it tricks the brain by constantly placing a cue\nAnd from out who as we heard a bit earlier has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets ... stations this device is pretty useful\nIf I come down in the morning without that she's on\nThe mountain I can manage to says okay and then I get to the corner of the kitchen and I find it really difficult to stand up and to get my feet moving so I Will have to pull on my leg some holding like pulling it around the corner or dragging myself along the the unit\nAnd then I get to the capital and I can't stand up straight to fill it in the capital\nAnd I'm guessing from the capital to the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then do you have to go and get the milk when I've forgotten to take it with me it's all those things but with the shoes on it's still hard what\nBut it makes it possible to do those things instead of almost impossible [noise]\n\nSounds like the navy and she's given have\nAnd I'm guessing from the capital to this the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then to have to going to get in the milk when I've forgotten to take it with me it's all say those things with his shoes on it's still hard what\nBut it makes it possible to do those things instead of almost impossible [noise]\n\n\nSounds like the navy and she's given have\nPeace of mind yeah she told me broadly speaking she can now go to places like the supermarket with the knowledge that she can get out of a freezing it showed if she knows it's going to happen\nHowever there are still occasions where episodes suddenly come on without warning\nSometimes I Do cross quite badly and I I can I Can't predict when that's going to be there's nothing I can do except wait for the medication to what the name and\nIn those situations even if she's got the shoes and by ... move on call ... the mom and she says era of limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven stuff is like the grass all that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the surfaces flat\nI was going to ask about that I imagine economies\nAnd in those situations even if she's got the shoes and by ... move on call ... the mom and she says era of limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven Seth is like the ... so that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the surfaces flat\nYeah I was going to ask about that I imagine a calm the very easy to see delays is on a sunny day\nYeah mounted mentioned to me that when she goes in ... in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she caught me really see lasers on so that's one of the drawbacks and she felt a independents not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible lump does\nSo it's not a perfect solution from out by the help so do we know how well the ... other people with Parkinson's\nService study was done and it showed that the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants off medication\nAnd when they were on medication the effect was still positive it was the decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent however that was a really small sample size or in the Nineteen participants in study\nThat's no and I wonder how do\nOther people with Parkinson's some study was done and it showed the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants off medication\nAnd when they were on medication the effect was still positive is the decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent however that was a really small sample size only Nineteen participants in our study\nYeah that's no and I wonder how do this you know do they make it stand out do you do a lot of attention to yourself\nYet definitely that was an incident in one of the uh the motives of this why someone in the Netherlands were on a train and it caused a lot of panic people food it was a weapon from what I understand what puff have rarely\nRefined products and sent to address some of those concerns but it is who is going to generate attention ... she's in public and they chose attention to something people might otherwise wanted to be quite private\n[noise]\nSo these two ideas don't pull and lays issue both of them are about manipulating the mind to make us feel old act differently than my own sort of way we can treat them\nIs who is going to generate tension ... she's in public and they chose attention to something people might otherwise one to be quite private\n[noise]\nSo these two ideas duck pool and lazy she both of them are about manipulating the mind to make us feel old act differently than my own food waste we can treat the brain so I ...\nYes it's definitely a growing area what's happening is wearable tech startups like top on laser she's\nA kind of tracking neuroscientist labs and that means that the solutions are reaching the real world a lot quicker previously they would have been but on the line for a long time\nSo it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of start ups and you're a scientist and professors knew assigned to show up and speaking to have said that it's very likely we're going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future [noise]\n\nThis fascinating thank you ... and things to all of you for listening to all tax\nIf you want to see those lazy she's an action\nSo it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together stops and you're a scientist and professors knew assigned to show up and speaking to have said this very lucky we are going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future [noise]\n\nThis past and I

precisely\nSpoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and really trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision [noise] the the vendors that were impacted were

or ammunition yourself\nThis drought during does manufacture those things so you you basically cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since
