taken into consideration and it comes to diagnose them I think for\nMy last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change it because I got my education from Russia and I spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling him what to do what's right\nConsideration and it comes to like I was thinking I think for my last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because

should do and we push a patient as the paternalistic way of telling him what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came severely a leading in flood level was very extremely low and the condition and somebody we don't have blood bank\nSo we have human ... so you need to call everyone who has the exact died\nOf blood and and draw divide Soviet struggled after you know six seven hours looking at blood and treasure feeding

if I don't give him\nA child he will just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader start listening an approach my patient more holistically where they're coming from is not only being a physician who or training to what that times for my clinical skill and Web approach\nI went to come back to some of the other cases in China\nFrozen and shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader I started listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from it's not only being a physician who or training to what that transformed my clinical skill is and where\nI went to come back to some of the other cases in challenges you faced take all the first one to ask you about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for non because most treatments were designed for men not women went inside\nWell science has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals\nThere's a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle\nNot only clinical trials but the early ways in which we\nResearch so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more

science has been done on a male model and even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women and late face clinical trials\nYou're still dealing with the issue of the science on which the clinical trials was based being based on a male model\nAnd can you give us an example of the disease that affects the chief ... different she\nSure let me just give you

in cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque\nOr the hardening of those arteries in the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference\nSo if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked\nThere are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology\nWomen are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to develop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the

but this is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair uh I'm guessing assessed tend to be told it can't be repaired so what we\nUh so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better they are not taking their business will be\nIts course here and I like to point to go ahead what we find is obviously policy of this is a ... is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they called the full to take something along to a professional repair uh I'm guessing assessed tend to be told to calm the retired so what we do is we do at least the

repairs who'd become cheaper\nNow for many people repairing professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is text tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax

cheaper\nNow for many people repairing professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is text tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change
