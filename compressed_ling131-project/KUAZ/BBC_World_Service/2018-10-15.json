the ones that game the vote the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator um who was the first a Democrat or to be elected I'm from Alabama in a generation um they're black women all over the ballots so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women\nAs the wheels on the bus but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them if

eighty\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or division of comments on line is that there is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with a deliberate intent to angry you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left\nAnd the idea is to divide those two groups of people further into heart in ... by their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIt's extraordinary

understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator that they were having that conversation and telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other at least they think well\nYeah I mean when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people responded to these people or pots or algorithms whatever they might be and they'll retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them the way that you create news\nI mean you and another political commentator out they were having a conversation and telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other at least they think well\nYeah I mean when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people responded to these people or bought sore algorithms whatever they might be and they'll retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging\nThey'll get angry at them the way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and then normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect id by a group of fake accounts on social media\nBecause you say the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone

fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block chain to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with Rosie reliability pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all of those notes are connected in every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized as time has no children how you do see\nBut it's also you can't delete essentially a ledger right so\nI'm ... pretty pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but

is so\nDecentralized yeah I mean it would be in a decentralized the times has no children how you do see centralized\nBut it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social social\nPlatforms absolutely yeah\nAre you optimistic so this is going to do we have a way through because ultimately we will go live with the Internet is not going to go away because on invented\nCan me I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we'd outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do what it does
