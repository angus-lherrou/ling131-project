and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind

temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the

Italy's debt\nThis is not a government living in the realm of of economic reality I'm afraid and and it doesn't seem like government you know especially listening to your interview just now leaving itself much room to back down there for this I added to that you have to include the but the fact that\nThere is now this competition within the government between the lake are now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself as a dominant force and so I I can see this becoming a set of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take 'em Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism was one phrase used um and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of the major\nAnd within the government between the Laker now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself is a dominant force and so I I can see this becoming a sort of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take 'em Brussels more\nUh you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism was one phrase used\nUm and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of the major showdown in which the Italian government actually embraces penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit has kinda macho politics isn't it absolutely does does\nCloud ... of the negative we could have a point I mean France and Germany they've gotten away with overspending and and you know exceeding their public debt limits that sets out buddy you why can't it and he just do the same it is one rule for them in one rule fits in isn't it\nIt's not a turkey and reasonable point and I think the the there was some in the commission particularly miss miss the most ... the a commissioner responsible for economic and financial if as who were willing to give it to leave them into bits of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalate this conflict they they would actually denied the Italian government the chance to\nSee ... this is disagreements with Brussels but I I think the difference as opposed to you\nThe same it is one rule for them and one rule Satan isn't it\nIt's not the turkey and reasonable point and I think the ... there was some in the commission particularly miss miss the most ... the a commissioner responsible for economic and financial effect who were willing to give it to leave government a bit of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalates this conflict they they would actually denied the Italian government the chance to\nA theatrical ... this is disagreements with Brussels\nBut I I think the difference I suppose ticket what people here in Brussels all in in the commission would say is that when Germany and France overstepped that a budget rules they will lead by governments that seemed at least to understand the importance of those rules are more willing to die that country's back onto a sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and the wildly unrealistic growth expectations and there's and say this is not a government we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German governments at the time when they overstepped the debt deficit limit\nBut the European Union can't afford to bailout his late ... this is this is the ultimately the big problem frankly\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this this also interact with of course the the ongoing debates about reforming the euro zone where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have a countries and\nAnd this week in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German governments at the time when they overstepped the debt deficit limit\nBut the European Union can't afford to ... this is this is the ultimately the big problem for actually\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this this also interact with of course the the ongoing debates about reforming the yours and where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have\nA countries like Italy like but also other other countries in southern Europe or who's the finances weaker and who feel that there is no ... years and who have been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and and on the other hand you have more than European states or one of them is Germany but even more hard line on this is the so called new ... league so this new kind of\nA ... or ...
