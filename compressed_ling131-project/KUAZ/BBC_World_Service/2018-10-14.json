there's a few out there um spray on which you're looking at tactile et cetera\nBut when I last excited as you can get is actually can we start to use is on humans get a little yeah because we thought that it can be ... to answer humans by and they seem to be getting federal not reset ... this whole beginning of his second skin discussion actually happen\nRadicals and it ... making ... ... at a

that if we could connect to explain and we both had these antennas on us and we could communicate in different ways a simple question how does that make ... or ...\n... well actually it could make our lives are much more chaotic because you know be as he says that transparent invisible you wouldn't even know who is possibly sending you different things will signals that but I think and not enough away it's maybe think about it in terms of like the concept of telepathy\nBut that she shifting that into a more um uh information\nAnd we both had these antennas on us and we could communicate in different ways a cynical question how does that make ... sake right okay we can do it but why\nWell actually it could make a ... because you know be as he says that transparent invisible you wouldn't even know who's supposed to be sending you different things ... signals see that but I think that's another way it's maybe that ... intense it's like the concept of telepathy\nBut that she shifting back into them all and uh information exchange connecting ... contacting each other and actually calling each other back and forward et cetera\nSo he's making all digital communications potential ...
