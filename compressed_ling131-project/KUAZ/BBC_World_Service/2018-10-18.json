years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize lamp\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes but over time it got buried in when we want to study it today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty five million years ago it didn't occur the dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have all that we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts in caused dramatic changes\nUh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nWow so it's a historical discovery in a

having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts can cause dramatic changes\nUh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nThat impact as a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called would lay we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter so it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice that
