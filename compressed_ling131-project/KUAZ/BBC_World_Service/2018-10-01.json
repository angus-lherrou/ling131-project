remarkable\nNo that impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the uh system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks shocks gr off puffing global\nIt was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks shocks gr off putting global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fired up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least nine among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages or any parts of the climate story and know the ... that matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on the earth to continue to increase and that has huge ramifications for global sea level rise\nAdmit ... these global averages or any parts of the climate story and not the ... us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time\nAs you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and

climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every year\nOf course you know write that one individual what Iran is not necessarily harming our county which is precisely the reason why we do attribution any because most of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that that used to be quite rare and it's now a relatively common and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world as the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense\nPrecisely the reason why we do attribution any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's\nRight to say this is something different something that needs to be quite rare and it's now a relatively calm and and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here of heat heat waves\nThe atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods\nAt the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states\nBut what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in

a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia is getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of

been white elephants as well as success stories in China\nYeah it's how they did was to become an ecological zero sort of an emission poster child but it didn't really succeed are there are many reasons behind it\nBut the shoreline this case just keep in mind that within the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned

magnets is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... basically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for

surrounding yeah Dan Charles service center\nWell George maintenance is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... basically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects and it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand eight actually as the financial crisis in the west started to send ripples through China\nUm and uh it was actually a time when the Chinese economy itself is actually going through a little bit of its own kind of tipping point\nSo really what's happened in the last ten years in particular I Would say\nAbout the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so every time the economy looks like it's looking a little bit wobbly\nUm you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments are on the other is because they they really believe this um the rats\nSo really what's happened in the last ten years in particular I Would say\nThat the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so every time the economy looks like it's looking a little bit wobbly\nAnd you get ... to build more infrastructure and then more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments are on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about a ... and leads to better growth\nAnd she is a huge contentious issue because some of us believe that she the sequencing works the other way round that actually you get better urbanized ... from having good growth model\nOr because actually if it was that simple than every what do you need for growth is just build ...\nPlus of course as a ... a declining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever and it wasn't always give you the same time that it did it and if us\nYes indeed and I think again you know like so many things in China and everything is so nuanced so\nIf you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure has a population of course it's still some way behind Japan a soul in Asia or you know American cities and European sites\nDeclining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever and it wasn't always give you the same time that it did at the ...\nYes indeed and I think again you know like so many things in China and everything is so nuanced so\nIf you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure has a population of course it still some way behind Japan\nA soul in Asia or you know American cities in European cities but um you know as long canes that kind of famous British economist ones that in the long run we're all dead\nAnd uh what we have to be concerned about really is about the missile allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks coast cities and and actually the problem\nAnd it can also lead a goal to huge amounts of public debt ... how big is Chinese public debt well uh it\nAbout ... at the end of two thousand and Seventeen was around three hundred and fifty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nI thought it was like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat whether that there is any magical number at which point you know a crisis ensues but certainly the the miss allocation of resources the cumulative increase in difficulties which smaller Chinese banks\nWell uh it is about ... at the end of two thousand Seventeen was around three hundred and thirty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nThat sounds like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat where the the there is any magical number at which point you know a crisis ensues but certainly the the miss allocation of resources the cumulative increase in\nDifficulties which smaller Chinese banks are facing um funding that loads of what they have to raise deposits and\nIf they can't raise them from households\nThey are raising them from increasingly a novel a tile an uncertain short term\nSources and I think these things are contrived to to bring about kind of some uncertainty now you've written a book called red flags I mean how much jeopardy is China or in from ... and other risks well I think I'm trying to death isn't the only problem that China faces it's also facing you know kind of a confluence of lots of problems aging\nIt's an another risks well I think I'm trying to death is the only problem charter faces but it's also facing you know
