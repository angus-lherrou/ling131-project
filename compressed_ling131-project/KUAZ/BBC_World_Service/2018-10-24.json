expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential invoked his so how should campaign be focusing should they be spending an online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to find all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists uh what digital allows a campaign to do is to target of\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising they'll work it does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction and so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early and\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise

the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early and campaigns so that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's

it's called\nWhich they hand some of them get so extreme they put bleach on their hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even leave their own house because they're worried that anything they touch will you know a contaminate them\n... treatments currently exist\nSo there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention so in that therapy\nThey as psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you\nGo and wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way up and these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and ah when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there are All right there's nothing wrong\nSo it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnother treatment as the selective serotonin ... uptake inhibitors these drugs\nBecause they're worried about this contamination but eventually it subsides and when

sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself\nSo there were two different types of Aspen both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you'd like on the behavior yes so they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that I've touched something I'd just can look at the\nUh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBP therapy they would say things like\nReflects if you'd like on my behavior yes so they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that have touched something I just can look at the\nUh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious so stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBD therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or\nUse a cloth twice so used to have to throw it away if I was wiping account to but now I realize that actually there's nothing nothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or\nWhen I touched been I don't need to rush away and wash my hands so what sort of says has have you had with those using this some brain training him so we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive\nSymptoms and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent so that was a good reduction because they've only use the F for one week stuff they used it
