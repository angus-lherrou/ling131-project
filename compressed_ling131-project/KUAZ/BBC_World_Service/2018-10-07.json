each country just have to fund these systems\nRight now thank you very much for that what it's made volunteer a fresh morning this week about the security of our personal assistance and other voice activated gadget that haven't listened to this\n\nProving that it was getting out is I think really unfortunate and you would think that we will be able to do something as a global community in areas that are affected us you know these rather than have each country just have to ... and just\nAll right bill thank you very much for that will just move on and see a fresh morning this week about the security about personal systems out other voice activated gadget that haven't listened to the\n[noise]\nWell that sounds pretty normal to me but that's actually something sinister hidden within ... rather nice sounding natural sounds ... to us\nThese sounds could trick your voice activated personal assistant or maybe in the future you're driverless car because concealed within that but so was a command to get one of your gadgets to hand over your contacts with don't eat that policy\nWhen that guy in this instance the embedded sound just type dummy count it as part of new research into the realm of psycho acoustic hiding\nDoor I'd say ... is professor in electrical engineering and information technology at ... university book and\nWere interested in seeing how far\nWe can go in using the difference between human protection machine audio protection because humans\nDo your contacts with don't eat the policy when I listened to the bed it sounds just type dummy tight as part of new research into the realm of like to stick hiding during the ... is professor in in ... well gee I rode university book um\nWe were interested in seeing how far\nWe could go in using the difference between human audio perception and machine on your perception because humans of course how some limits to their perceptual\nAbility for example after a very loud sound human won't be able to proceed very quiet town for free speech recognition system it's just the same and there's other effects like that so not only can you not your client silence after an hour south\nBut also when you have a very loud sound wanted one frequency for example let's say you at the very very out\nFifty herds them then you won't be able to hear a very quiet sounds like at fifty five for its really close by to that loud sound and all of those so called cycle acoustic masking effect are utilized already by many gadgets in ... so for example you were MP three player\nBut also when you have a very loud sound at one frequency for example let's say you at the very very out\nFifty Ford's ... then you won't be able to hear very quiet sounds like at fifty five for its really close by to that is loud sound and also so called cycle acoustic masking effect are utilized already by many gadgets\nAnd checks so for example you were an MP three player also uses those cycle acoustic effects\nTo be able to work with very compressed audio files an MP three including you only in cold that information that is relative and that just perceptive ... to a human listener and you can\nThrow away you can discard parts of the sound that won't be perceived or maybe not in coal them so precise me so there's a lot of tech out there that's using the old\nUm cycle ... masking effect but we were wondering if it would also be possible to use them to hide information from humans which would then be very clearly proceed with the for an automatic system\nRight so it seems from your research that there are ways of am betting on during the ... the older moved by ... ...\nBe perceived or maybe not include them so precisely so there's a lot of tech out there that's using the old\nUm cycle ... masking effect that we were wondering if it would also be possible to use them to hide information from humans which would then be very clearly proceed with the for an automatic system\nRight so it seems from your research that there are ways of am betting and doing so imperceptibly audio signals malicious ... within very sounds and they might be able to chicken or something like what about your voice systems or elect so have you\nYou have another example which involves an autonomous cars to join let's vehicles what is that\nThe idea is really that if we had\nThat were controlled by voice that we can use that very same attack factor to make it for example in in our example activate the emergency brakes by voice\nSo that you while you're being driven by you know told them it Scott Simon and Garfunkel on the radio\nI mean\nI mean that music sounded normal to me but now we're going to have that same bit of music but you modified it in your research\nTech sector to make it for example in in our example activate the emergency brakes by voice\nSo then you while you're being driven by you know told them is called Simon and Garfunkel on the radio\nAnd I mean\nI mean that music sounded normal to me but now we're going to have that same bit of music but you modified it in your research\nShame on me\nWhich to me frankly it sounds like the ... that we played in the first place but in the second clip of the Simon and Garfunkel this is even better some kind of come out and that will trigger the call to do something then\nYeah it's actually full week in bed at a combined ... emergency brakes and ... all the war and of course that's neat pretty trim me to a very scary scenario where\nYou could imagine a few years in the future\nPeople being actively put at risk by their says driving those gaps in security aren't really so\nYeah so you mean by that caused go on the other thing I saw it on my speech recognition yeah we're the ... and the same way as if you'd actually set out\nAnd of course that's needs pretty trained to me to a very scary scenario where um\nYou could imagine a few years in the future\nPeople being actively of put at risk by their says driving tech if those gaps in security aren't really so\nYeah so you mean by the calls go on and I asked my six speech recognition yeah upper the I'm Sorry but how you doing the same way as if you'd actually set out loud to put the exams\nObviously this is proof of principle and bumping but you point to an end you'll probably be you haven't actually done this are you with the ... as it was just going straight to the voice recognition system so that made me very much prefer principle\nThat's all I'm ... and that our system currently have\nAnd the second imitation is that we're currently assuming that we know all the parameters of the speech recognition system\nSo in effect for attacking the speech recognition that we've trained ourselves that's a ... system so it's a speech recognizer that is very widely used and the research community and we're pretty sure that it's also used in many commercial systems\nBut we definitely need to know all its parameter person to compete\nBe assuming that we know all the parameters of the speech\nRecognition system so in effect were attacking the speech recognition in fact we've\nTrained ourselves it's a ... system so it's a speech\nRecognizer that is very widely used and the research community and we're pretty sure that it's\nAlso used in many commercials systems\nThat we definitely need to know all its parameter person to compete structure in order to attack us system and so this kind of attack it's only by you have to either if you have some\nPossibility twin for the prime of tourists from some tests signals Assange twin aunts our system looking at it it's all put to or if you can actually go and use the parameters and some other\nWay for example by having somebody inside the company\nOr is this book is very experimental it's a ... at this stage but what she'll my message that you want to get across from\nWhat I really think it's sad for me it's the point in time we're companies offering speech recognition systems should look at how to make their system robust against the kind of an attack\nYeah I'm just I think ... call so we need some ... there were no security\nBy having somebody inside the company does this work is very experimental it's at ... at this stage ... what's your main message that wants to get across from this research\nWhat I really think is currently the point in time we're companies offering speech recognition systems should look at how to make their system robust against us in the town\nYou know that's an understatement I think there are attacked costs that we need some ...

I Know you've heard this one before on this very shy repeatedly but says you think professor material science and electrical engineering at MIT lakes is where it really does move the field on the term wearable\nIf you just think about it was really developed to describe something we don't wear what we where we call\nClothes and that really sets the stage for really what we've been focused on here which is really getting technology in to the things you actually we're into Europe flowed into the fabrics and into the fiber themselves\nAnd that really is what sets us apart and and what makes this point in history so special\nSay are we moving beyond like it'll find strands of cup of a wife and into like a black T shirt that you just buy from the local store and then sold ... onto a piece of who wants to ... which I've done in ...\nYou know in order to deliver and make technology happen you need to have an insulator you need to have a conductor to get signal\nReally is what sets us apart and and what makes this point in history so special\nSay are we moving beyond the confines strands of cup of a way for them to like a black T shirt that you just buy from the political store and then sold ... onto a piece of ... which I've done an awful lot of my career you know in order to\nDeliver and make technology happen you need to have an insulator you need to have a conductor to get signals in and out but the most important material the most important class of materials that really enables all of the technology that we know of today is called the Seventy\nAnd until very recently literally a few weeks ago there were no real reports on how to get semi conductors into fibers and into fabrics\nWithout semi conductors your phone is not smart at all [laughter] without semi conductors we don't have computers and without semi conductors we don't have displays and we don't have communication [noise]\nAnd so um what I wanted to focus on is the importance of getting semi conductors into fibers end fabrics as an enabler of functionality and enabler of you know I don't like to use the term smart or we could leave that to describe humans but\nConductors your phone is not smart at all without semi conductors we don't have computers and without semi conductors we don't have displays and we don't have communication\nAnd so um what I wanted to focus on is the importance of getting semi conductors into fibers end fabrics as an enabler of functionality and enabler of you know I don't like to use the term smart or we could leave that to describe humans\nBut certainly something which is highly functional and technological and into\nThe ... revolution happened after all because we have good uh I'm growing components transistors ... wife was acidic or how many go so far as to say well now you are doing that in fabric\nAnd so the essence of the paper that just came out about a month ago in nature was to announce the emergence of a a Moore's law quibbling thin fibers and so we benefit over the past fifty years from a Moore's law in in a semi conductor industry\nAn ounce the emergence of a a Moore's law quibbling thin fibers and so we benefit over the past fifty years from a Moore's law in in the semi conductor industry uh we're by the basic functionality the chip grew\nAnd what if your goal is getting your kid into an elite university\nThe answer I

Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change would exacerbate the events but as the hurricane season started his motives were suggesting we went to some of the coma\nLet me issue me a ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that prediction was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into a new

these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall as it raised with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nKey findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar\nEqual if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before foreign ... made landfall ... raised with scale fool wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great slightly who all of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nSo what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast\nFor the also which is as a great the likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount the strength of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause has Michael Mann has already explained it was the normal ... Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nWe basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been with\nHow in the ... tradition you could ... them specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have done without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast with our climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as on a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that's ... associated with greenhouse gases\nAbsolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform or changing of the assets\nHad on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and I believe that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that are associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a change in the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in the set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent the interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of

interest Michael Mann particularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius\nSo there's a very large region in the Atlantic the sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit 'cause you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier
