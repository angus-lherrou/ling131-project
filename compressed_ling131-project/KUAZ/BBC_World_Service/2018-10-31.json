I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy\nThat the second generation the children of working class immigrants are properly integrated into our society and are allowed to flourish\nIt kind of changes the whole nature of what America is about though is well doesn't it I mean the America's always been about people coming to see the American dream being always be in the country what people just go to realize what they call it ...\nWell ... I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds\nThat was a time with the birth rate in the states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states in that era\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly\nStates in that era if you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skill workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThen the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification\nThat entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think\nAbout the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ...

[noise]\nIt's a question I put to these Chomsky she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nYou look at the history of immigration and how immigrants have been treated in

not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we see this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship citizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from

that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries\nHave
