in the west operate on what though is\nAnd I think I'm willing to ... come on to our safety ... out of the leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean it is the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country wants to be the policemen of the world is this a wrong or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church was different set of values than we in the west\nOperate on what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from turkey if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nWill murder is always gruesome regardless of how it takes place um and I think ah the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping and dripping information and then saying don't don't take this into account that authorized leaks so it's important to look\nAt a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was um as as Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials and on and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation by the Saudis and how's the world would react to it\nAnd of course ... when when you all happening in Yemen neighborhoods\nDon't don't take this ... authorized leaks so important to look\nAt a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was um as as Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials and and and I think we'll just have to wait for the results of the investigation by the Saudis and how's the world would react to it\nAnd I couldn't remember that when we knew what was happening in Yemen they will still gathering very happily and what what do you think about not\nWhat I mean the Yemen crisis is is is another one you've got it it it's not the subject is operating the ritzy around with who says if the straits of of um of matter rape in the south is Red Sea all closed at Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through the straits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us\nAll goes through there it's it's ... you know you could argue that Saturday is actually the fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west who would be having to pay the price for its\nOne of the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is that sort of fragile and complexity of political settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime what I mean that's what's happened in Tucson\nIt's it's ... you know you could argue that Saudis actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west who would be having to pay the price for it\nOne of the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is that sort of fragile and complexity of political settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWell I mean that's what happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of ISIS and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not only Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but the Shiite extremist and and and you you have and then you've got the oil is um we have severe political and economic repercussions that will take many many
