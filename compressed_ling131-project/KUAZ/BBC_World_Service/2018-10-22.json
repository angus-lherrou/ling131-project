World Service my guests today has become one of the world's leading public intellectuals who's focused much of his attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and others\nThrough the complex prism of race gender religion class and nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to dig deep into such questions comes from a very personal place\nHe is the child of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will connect ... politician in pre independence gone to\nHis mother was an English woman of Eris the critics dog Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy on law at New York University He is a gay man who's married to his partner have more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi led a sense of self can be and yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on the vision we use race religion and the class to separate us from them\nProfessor of philosophy and law at New York University He is a gay man who's married to his partner of more than two decades so his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi lead our sense of self can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on division we use race religion and the class to separate us from them increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict and hate\nSo is there an end to vote to this preoccupation with group on tribe well Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now\nWelcome to talk to the beer\nYou have to spend a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves\nSo let's start with a simple question how do you label yourself\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm half\nA gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that's the that gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nLife thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves\nSo let's start with a simple question how do you label you also\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm half a gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that's the that gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nTo you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of ... of your identity although ... are you thinking that you're sending signals\nTo your interlocutor about about who you are\nI think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals from faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much as I think many people assume\nUh they they will so I ... I grew up in Guyana and my father was going to end but that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am and gun or it doesn't tell you how much I never got us as I Am ... and so on many people that would be more informative to know what the nationalities you know if if ...\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't\nYou as much as I think many people assume uh they they will so I I grew up in Guyana and my father was going to end\nBut that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am and gun or it doesn't tell you how much I Know that got us as I Am the death of that is and so on many people that would be more informative to know what their nationality is you know if if at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say that in in in all of your work on race religion and creed as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves into identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we're all so complex and so you need that almost any label we apply is in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take any bill the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even cost you know one of those there's so much diversity within them\nNeat that almost any label we apply is in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take any bill the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even class you know one of those there's so much diversity within them\nAnd to create a kind of solidarity based on false beliefs about what we alike and ... about what that I I think those people are dangerous the world is full\n... so you ... I mean this isn't just about Donald Trump one clinic or look at the populism in an nativism in Europe where they are very low income I tell you we're solving am I interviewed on how talk recently in Italy and you're looking Victor O'Bannon hunger you could look at a whole host of frankly you can look beyond the shows have Europe to India where\nThe current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nAnd it does so but the point you alluded to earlier you ultimately are an optimist and you believe that the trajectory of the human\nThe nativism in Europe where they are ... are my tell yourself in their mind viewed um how talk recently in Italy a new look in Victor O'Bannon hunger you could look at a whole host of frankly you could look beyond the shows have Europe to India where the current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nAnd it does it so but the point you alluded to earlier you ultimately are an optimist and you believe that the trajectory of the human condition is in ... in that positive sense toward a more universal list a more\nHumane understanding compassionate humanity I guess how can you square that with what you see well uh\nI I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just five or ten years or ten or twenty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect or in many ways over the last century I'll say for example\nThink about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting to ask people in many many countries over the last century and look at the massive reduction in a racial or discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of the increasing coming together of Europe at the same\nI'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect or in many ways over the last century I'll say for example\nThink about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting to ask people in many many countries over the last century look at the massive\nReduction in a racial or discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of the increasing coming together of Europe at the same at the moment of these moments of nationalism\nAnd put the brakes it to one side which one has to do um Europe is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century\nSo uh or even in the mid ... century so I think older they said if you look over a long enough horizon\nYou can see the general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nArea where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in in the western world ah societies and cultures view a gender issue has been particular sexuality I mean your your uh uh a known for very long time in out\nGay man you took advantage of Americans change of the law so that you could Mario long term partner\nHow far can we go\nI Would regard as up one area where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in the western world ah societies and cultures view a gender issues then to take the sexuality I mean your your uh uh I Know a lot for very long time in out\nGay man you took advantage of Americans change of the laws that you could Mario long term partner\nHow far can we go with the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways that we never even thought of before not just in terms of\nOf sexuality but even in terms of of basic gender where now there is a a very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women there are a lot of people who define themselves as known binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appears to be moving\nTo to accept them in New ways where does this end well\nDon't think he ends the ... there are two things at the airport but where it doesn't that doesn't end with the disappearance of identity we are reforming are jammed assisted by not getting rid of gender altogether I ... I can ... I Believe that I live alone all into the remote future we'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the ...\nThere are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appears to be moving to to accept them in New ways where does this end well\nI don't think he ends the ... there are two things at the airport but where it doesn't that doesn't end with the disappearance of identity we are reforming our gender system but by not getting rid of gender altogether I ... I can ... I Believe that I live along all into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nThere's the question is where the self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm blushing between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on how to not so long ago we spoke to a woman cold ritual dollars though who\nIs white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and and and live a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nParents which could identify them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and ... and lived her life was a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between self and and and others I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of your own race all on their own race is a special category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's put you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trans people have done what Rachel ... didn't do which is they've\nCreated a movement to allow them to be what they want to be an artist and they've asked us to change the system I have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity\nTo adapt system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I ... I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them if racial\nPeople have done the trick trans people have done what Rachel Dolezal didn't do which is they've\nCreated a movement to allow them to be what they want to be an artist and they've asked us to change the system have I'm happy to respond\nAffirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt the system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I am asking them the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nIf racial do they'll have could have provided a could've made these arguments on the side of the people in began the thing and if you could have done this in the way it was a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments and doing it that way\nIs if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on our end she has to do it with other people have to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you would have been very consistent saying it's not my job to fix the society is simply to understand the Knicks\nIn America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments and doing it that way is if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on our energy has to do with other people have to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you would have been very consistent saying it's not my job\nTo fix the society is simply to understand then explain how societies work to my fellow citizens now I I get that\nBut do you have ideas which you can share with me as as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nI think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division\nThat's the thing that one's looking full so that I think some things can be said or but these are just things that are known to social psychologist one is don't close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less ... than people did that so don't allow yourself\nTo be channeled off into a world in which you actually are\nHelps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division\nThat's the thing that was looking for for that I think some things can be said a but these are just things that are known to social psychologist one is don't close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less bigoted then people who've done so don't allow yourself\nTo be channeled off into a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among\n'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people have all the major kinds and do things with them that's not about race or religion or or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about\nUm you know building something in your community together worked together with people because I think working together with people of diverse identities\nMakes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly if you have folks ideas about them as long as the falls out some leading you to behave badly\nI'm not so worried about the people have false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and the ... and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about the final thought\nOr we have a a thinker and writer in the United kingdom kingdom come David good heart\nSomething in the community together woods together with people because I think working together with people to divest identities makes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly is to have false ideas about them as long as the falls out as hell leading you to behave badly\nI'm not so worried about the people that false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and it and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nA final thought we'd have a a thing Kevin Rice or in the United kingdom called David good hot who said that these days the most important distinction and identity that that one can use when looking at people in western society is between those goals\nAnyways and those sequels some ways now the anyways other highly educated usually metropolitan highly immobile people who are comfortable\nIn an open intellectual environment living pretty much anywhere in their own country or indeed in the world that would be you and then there's some way as a deeply rooted people who are not so immobile whose fault purchases or perhaps more localized not so open\nAnd then they according to David good hot I'm much less interested in the kind of\nIdeals that you've just been painting with me\nAm happy to live in a world with the somewhere\nComfortable in an open intellectual environment living pretty much anywhere in our own country or indeed in the world that would be you and then there's some way as on deeply rooted people who are not so immobile whose fault purchases or perhaps more localized not so open\nAnd then they according to David good hot I'm much less interested
