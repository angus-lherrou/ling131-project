and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I ... a share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that was when he was shot\nAnd and as a moral in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream orders caught us which is a Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the ... and that is traditionally a time but only those were morning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I haven't\nNoise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that is when he was shot\n'em and after the memorial in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream order Scottish which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up to the ... and that is traditionally a time it only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day\nThere will be nobody to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing out to that standing up together it's such a metaphor and I think overall Israeli\nJews and Israelis in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nYou know the president does reveal are quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\n[noise] me think um\nBecause they had their Jewish community within their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nYou know the president does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\nHere let me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews aren't too there are different path right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much\nBelieve in the ... the repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant which is\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once a stranger in Egypt and so\nThere's this very strong desire to acknowledge that you know American Jews have done fairly well to themselves in in America I'm and feel fairly successful and feel very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens them to sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still\nFeel under attack they feel very much sort of the product of sort of post traumatic has Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much in sort of zero sum game it times you know uh\nAnd so there's this very strong desire to acknowledge that you know American Jews have\nDone fairly well to themselves in in America I'm and feel fairly successful into celebrate comfortable um

Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much and it sort of zero sum game at times you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm threats from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlights those splintered\n[noise] reporter Dana cropped with Haaretz in Tel Aviv she's also the host of the podcast the branch Dina thanks very
