these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to most of all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when that war began\nIs that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success some policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your

reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of what he asked me to do but at a point an news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk and the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this

creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins of the idea that we're going to be decisive foot river really defending what we ought to do is put in drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number

[noise]\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nSo I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue because the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and in America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those\nAnd it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid out for me what is your take on the on the tone things up by the oval
