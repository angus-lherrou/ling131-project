times earth's gravity so pretty intense flight um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start doing\nI Believe they're about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to do with the fact that there were\nNo longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start

details about what might have causes problem I don't know if\nThey've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact\nBut I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nNo us and Russia they're frequently in a specially these days when it comes to politics but\nThey were

Russia they're frequently in a specially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight one is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics inter now it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has had an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at\nThe moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue

international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts\nInto orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually they got up there and just the way is as well and the slaves capsules can't last forever and or but they have a two hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into that\nSo they are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty Soyuz capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board\nBut that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nOr below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into that\nSo there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that
