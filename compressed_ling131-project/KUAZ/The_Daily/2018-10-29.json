now so they will have to do that so for people who live in the Arctic these changes are really big deal and many northern cultures sellers cut into the permafrost have been a reliable way to store

of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means

the plug out of the freezer and then start countries sauce\nAnd so then one from a frost it starts to truly saw than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because microbes are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing basically and then they emit carbon\nSo it's micro breath that we have to worry about [laughter] basically [laughter] microbes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn upper basin\nGets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as missing or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them stalling speeds them backup\nBack at the lake Matilda roses\nMicrobes when living things die microbes

huge amount of carbon bookstores here in from across we're trying to actively to figure that out\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex but it's also hard because humans have never warned the planet up like we are now\nWe have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective we're in what climate

world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because there are many ah thresholds that you might cross there\n... says that in many parts

not about saving the pull up there I think a lot of people and I think over time and she has an awful lot slow disappear the pull up there it's cute but but it's also about like us surviving as a species because if it gets much warmer\nAct the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we like the food we eat\nAnd where we live is just not adapted to and\nWe don't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon and the process just builds on itself\nWe don't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from

warming which leads to the release of more carbon and the process just builds on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we've put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment we're conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done [noise] and now we just have to ride it out\n[noise] oh we have an ability

of the waste is to try and understand this experiment better and that's my part that's what we do here\nAnd the other part is acting on what we already know which is still putting so much greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [noise] yeah I I think we have a responsibility and I think we can act\nFor the world any Martin ...
