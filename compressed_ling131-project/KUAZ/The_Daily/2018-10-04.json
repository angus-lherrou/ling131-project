real Americans and obvious Gaither activity\nAnd in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very device in\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the veteran the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the
