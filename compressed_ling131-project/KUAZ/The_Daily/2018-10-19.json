sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality cop show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who are\nWorking against the terms of of their views in Japan and stake out people you're there with them in the car um they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of this show suggest there for two in the next plane type thing\nWow

him in the next plane type thing\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nAnd Japanese it's called that high killing a shooting Kahn which I guess translate says caught at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show it uh in Japan called a ... she can kind of which is like caught at the moment of harassed sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada Ryan from for example uh we had a show like this that Canada border services agency\nCooperated with with the producers and actually the Kenyan government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless and it was only taken off the

program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very Leary Anne and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's it's it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in writing pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to eat\nThe dormitory where some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in a minute sort of narrative and say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with their with them in the car there's a a camera\nYou know you're driving down the road it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations you can't really show anybody's face so everything is word out including the like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood or the people who live there would probably complain in ...\nThe area it's a it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with

... criticized and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out\nImages you can't see people's spaces voices are disguised as quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is it a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because uh the the program did to cooperate with the the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be somewhere PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying\nBecause uh the the program did to cooperate with ah the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl so they they I mean there's people who put

going to be some work PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan what have active it's been saying\nWell I mean yeah I like online there was considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism or movements and so yeah they they basically said why are you joining us into the entertainment like why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it'd be in the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about ah people from\nAnd then um the the mainstream media

suppose have biases about ah people from other countries have a they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and and they're coming over here and in taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'm not sure like uh\nI think it's just kind of a ... kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy theme tune that everybody's not singing [laughter]\nI mean I I guess you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for Brexit or invasion of Crimea so many people are just feeling I'm\nLess secure in their own country and so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some
