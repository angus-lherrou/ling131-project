told them it was true the Arctic Circle is moving and that's because the axis of the earth is moving slowly racking up and down between twenty two and twenty four and a half degrees foreseen says this movement happens in a predictable cycle\n... for two thousand years twenty thousand years in one grocery and twenty thousand years' worth\nIt's called ... and it changes the amount of the planet that goes into total darkness and total daylight every year when the earth's axis gets closer to straight up and down the Arctic Circle shrinks when it gets more tilted the circle spreads out\nRight now we're somewhere in the middle of that cycle heading closer to straight up and down so the Arctic Circle is moving north and for Iceland this means that it's slowly slipping away grim Z is currently the only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle\nAnd not drawn tourists here for decades as Steve Chrysler describes\nWhat they did his you know just when you arrived in the plane is there is a sign that may develop them in the ... the the unload the tourists up there and that could walk in there on the line\nSort of straight up and down so the Arctic Circle is moving north and for Iceland this means that it's slowly slipping away Grimm's he is currently the only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle and that's drawn tourists here for decades as the Chrysler describes\nWhat they did his you know just when you arrived in the plane is that it was assigned the maid of honor minimum dots where the the all of the tourists will therapy that go walk from around the science gives them a certificate and send them back home again\nIn twenty Thirteen the local government decided this simple Arctic Circle marker was due for an upgrade so they launched a competition and like Christian said earlier the information they put out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year\nBut stores teen told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that an average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touch currency for a few more decades\nIf I had to leave the Harlem to learn from forties showed one would be if you go to live with him\nThat the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth's axis begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people have ...\nAnd that an average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touch currency for a few more decades\nIt's heading north to relieve the Harlem to learn from forties showed one would be if you go to ... or more yeah\nAfter that the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth's axis begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people have ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith when we moved from ... and you saw this is true\n[noise]\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to make\nThey could ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument and the same old place or they could let this new information reshape their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt guest they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than a nice easy fiction\nSo so everything is changing it's all\nKinds of things on the move so we had lots of different ways of representing this moment and then gradually it crystallized into something as simple as a sport\nOr they could not this new information reshape their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt gassed they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than a nice easy fiction\nSo so everything is is changing its or or who was on the move so we had lots of different ways of representing this moment and then gradually it's crystallized into something as simple as a sport because it's something you can move around it also represents what we're wrong\nBecause everything that we're talking about or thinking about is that she affected by balls\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much ... are really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presidents and certain physicality a certain weight\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us now there was the thing that we realize they have to be big enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms rocked you know it's an even if five people link that author it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life does its own thing\nCertain physicality a certain weight so\nAn enormous mall of concrete\n... tons\nIt's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger

south\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated\nThe Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction moon has one of her to ... says that has the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there was a much smaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\nOn ... aging point six years\nWhen it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a squid all a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on or seen said this\nSmaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\nOn ... both aging going to choose\nWhat it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle

out as one factor comes into his own people remember seeing ... Berger a lot to use the movement of the U.S crushed this is something we can't produce very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all of this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers\nIt seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on this tiny little line the human beings and drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you accept as you get older you realize that you don't have a grasp on everything the older you get the more you realize you don't know\nKind of thing happens to all of us this moment\nTo Steve and Kristin and the competition organizers it seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on his tidy little line the human beings have drawn around the top of the earth but the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you accept this you get older you realize that you don't have a girl from everything the older you get the more you realize you don't know\nThis kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're gonna take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and wondered could there be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nFirst of all\nEarth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuate\nThing that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is

look\nFirst of all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades\nAnd the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact so we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be\nWhen it came to making this Arctic Circle monument Steven Kristen chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truth [noise]\nIt's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact so we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do

it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool\nThis is a moving to use it for ... which which has nothing you can touch or see and that's interesting the object is following this idea\n\nThe ball is the least important thing about the piece itself is the movement what the bull does is it represents the movement\nWe humans don't really like change we like sharp lines and fern definitions but the actual physical world doesn't work this way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature instead they're occurs twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nEverything\nThe
