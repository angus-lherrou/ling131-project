you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stabilizing\nYou're among them on ... when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any

immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we had a system\nWe have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in this country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in the system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nFor those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow\nNeeds to fix it um how do you respond to

prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not a ... it's not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of

I'm I'm\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know doing a lot of visits certainly to different shelters looking at this

the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency\nThis change what essentially mean anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by access in government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card advocates fear this could lead to families\nPresident Trump's crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency this change what essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government\nBy accessing government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen that happening but Lucy is a pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule is a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who is applying for a visa for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice\nTo either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services that include healthcare Nutrition Assistance and your family can remain together in this country so really this proposed rule\nPermanent residency so what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents\nAre immigrant families with an unfair choice either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services\nThat include healthcare and Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to child and family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nOf this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even ... or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you can tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family\nPrograms again like snap and even ... or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you can tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so\nAs recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as with many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so and she's also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined I'm and she said that\nSo many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so as she was also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined\nI'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S\nSo I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support that they could get if their families were not being place in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either stability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice for the mess\nOthers over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either\nStability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice for the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately of an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so\nWhich which really is a lifeline for a lot of my family is they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nProvides healthy foods and includes housing assistance 'em and other services that actually\nWith the the programs that are affected include
