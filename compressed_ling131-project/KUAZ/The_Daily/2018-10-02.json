government deficit hawks like Congressman Paul Ryan work constantly banging the drum about the perils of a rising us debt here's Ryan speaking to CNN in two thousand and twelve\nWomen that crisis right in front of us and what brings down great empires past and future in debt and they're doing nothing to prevent it and here's\nDonald Trump speaking to CBS when he was running for president\nI Will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue and President Obama has pretty much double the debt since he's been in office and somebody's got to pay a big price we have to start chopping that debt down\nBut once Obama was out and Trump was in the Republicans were singing a different tune under Trump and Speaker Ryan spending has gone up\nAnd here's Donald

Speaker Ryan spending has gone up and the Republican tax cuts have blown a bigger hole in the budget [noise] today the U.S debt sits at Twenty one trillion dollars a huge scary figure but also kind of meaningless by itself\nWhere the threshold is too high we don't know but rising forever is definitely an unsustainable on big problem and we're the only advanced economy on an unsustainable course\nEconomists like Jason ferment at Harvard's Kennedy School of government study what's called the debt to GDP ratio how much a country owes versus how much it generates\nAll the other advanced economies it's falling\nGermany France Mexico Argentina Mongolia they're all carrying a smaller debt to GDP ratio than the U.S if you look at a list of how we rank internationally\nOnly advanced

really extraordinary and very irresponsible unless Congress fundamentally changes the path of its path we are headed for a Greek type crisis\nBut what exactly could that mean\nThe rising a debt a you know could could create this crisis situation where interest rates a spike the government has to take drastic actions perhaps you know cutting benefits a Social Security and other benefits are radically or hiking taxes are dramatically which will damage the economy\nSocial unrest people taking to the streets as their savings evaporate could that happen in the United states of America\n... gold wine doesn't see us as the next Greece but he does think we should be paying more attention to the debt one of the scary things about that as we probably won't know where to deep in debt until it's too late gold wine is uh\nAnd other benefits are radically or hiking taxes are dramatically which will damage the economy\nSocial unrest people taking to the streets as their savings evaporate

is we probably won't know where to deep in debt until it's too late\nGold wine is a senior policy director with the nonpartisan think tank the committee for responsible federal\nBudget I don't think we're headed for Greek like crisis because unlike Greece we've our on our own currency and we can actually make her own party but I Do believe that our current path is unsustainable\nAnd I do believe that if there isn't a course correction at some point um we will face a financial crisis who actually potentially create a global financial crisis\nIs not as bleak as a full scale Greek crisis
