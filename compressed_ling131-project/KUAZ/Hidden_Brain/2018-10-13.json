training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes [noise]\n\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district in rural Ohio that let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for its retro guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team is a pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that

exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in the small safe that have been installed in locations over the school\nI saw the run a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the near safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that fire during these drills [noise]\nSo the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe enough you have to put your finger on the sensor is like a hundred\nAnd it's a little tricky\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shooter [noise]\nTo was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into

grade six to twelve\nAnd he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria he's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused\nArea where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one of these shootings another kid can kill enough of this way\nElementary awareness and the elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and

and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there is a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school goes into lockdown the heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one now\nGo driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go we go [noise] door opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWas great that was an attorney compared to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing there were spies\nWasn't great that was the attorney compared to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to though\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department are being here were Fifteen minutes away\nYou were you worried because you realize that you're on your own and and so I wanted to learn [noise]\nIn an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be

were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own and\nAnd so I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and how to handle it down\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're ... you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot at target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I'm In\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou

you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility of somebody else getting her [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed it [noise] but these\nThings don't stop happening [noise]\nThey

others look at previous shootings it'll pass despite the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish the shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nAt one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as

there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than where I say I mean they knew what to do what it is [noise]\nEven

been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for every ... this is what a code black is this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind

ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in their classroom doors the paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nYou know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was

the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the

the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how much you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some

closet it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Ferris says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by we heard noises\nMy friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there's a shooter there's a

bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the cause it without having the light on when I heard the door open but it sounded like he was opens with the key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is the police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm\nNot your first time I set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nBecause you

it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons\nDrawn she really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shooter saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle pushed it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nMust have told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEven did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells\nHere in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] was uh told me

that\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we can talk about them are still statistically rare [noise] but now Melissa and actually has been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this\nAbout ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives in mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what the effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U.

single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's\nTwo o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too\nA big advocate for not using codes at all I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat bad means active shooter means I\nThis like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's\nTwo o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your

for your brain to go ... bad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise]\nVersus if I say there is a gunman in the pool [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked ... ... ... but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about Ashley curse how she eats dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of students from ever it was a break from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be\nSometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or

a dozens of scared student I'm ever arose a break from our schools\nProtocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with this\nAnd unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes one thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricade in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door\nBut most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did it was actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked and barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nFrom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did just actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull those kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nOn this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide [noise]\nWhen I asked her what the drill is four she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids\nWe don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some\nThe red like

Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to reckon with\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOh one more thing I'd say to my daughter's school Charles point about don't say codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nThing that can keep her completely safe [noise]\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school shelves point about don't say codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nChance brief taken nice the press he can nice the rats [laughter]\nOkay okay [laughter]\nAfter a few minutes he's cut his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops he wants to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad suddenly switches gears and start selling
