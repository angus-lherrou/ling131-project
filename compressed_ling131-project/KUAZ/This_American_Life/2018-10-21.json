thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I was saying well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I sit in the article I committed a crime and I did\nYou know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again

to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went\nI I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kids came up there and said hey go outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa\nShe looked like she was passed out\nAnd so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off many he he took her paintings off\nAnd then he he pulled on his than any one\nThey are and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa

off\nAnd then he he pulled on his pants\nAnd he went on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... ... you also write that you and other boys are the party started touching another young woman who was also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nThis was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did\nOut on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was\nWhen the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at
