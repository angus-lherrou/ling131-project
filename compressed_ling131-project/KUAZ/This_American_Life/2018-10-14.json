Joel what have you seen\nI've seen long lines for gas for food for water um for all sorts of basic supplies are as people are trying to come back into their homes and and clean up after the storm\nBut you know long lines is an improvement because earlier in the week you couldn't find any of those things in Panama City or any of the surrounding suburbs\nUm so you know we are seeing an emergency response really start to step up and get these things out to people but it's it you know it remains a challenge to find some to get supplies into some of the harder hit areas\nI'm In the suburbs to

existent for days after the storm and it's still really spotty I'm In Panama City in the surrounding county\nAnd it's difficult because people can't coordinate the emergency response it's hard to\nTell people where to go if you can't communicate with them and it's also making it really difficult for people to call their family members and check in and say hey I you know I'm OK I'm here you

they say that you really can still get a diverse class by considering things like geography and socioeconomic status\nBut as you mentioned the biggest delegation here is that Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of statistical analysis actually but it basically boils down to an argument
