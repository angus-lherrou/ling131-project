actually live in the eye\nBecause I just don't know I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics or we talked a lot about politics

you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and you know kids who go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working in immigration because I saw all these families who were being

who\nThe ... how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working in immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there's another solution that there is a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that\nPeople who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more

people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime\nUm people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I Believe doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nMade me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side I think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides\nYou know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered [noise]\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it so you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would\nI I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nGuess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it so you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote

on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and not coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nBoxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and

trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust she says a lack of trust in people and businesses have held China's economy back so in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them\nAnd you know who has lots of data on how people behave companies especially big companies like Ali Baba that as China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country and has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit\nSo the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit score\nWay people that school is not seem to do and they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy not ease your responsible so your school go out but if\nAli Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country and has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit so the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit score\nThe way people that school is not somebody when they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy not peas your responsible so your school will go up but if you buying video games you lazy CEO school go down\nBut it's a credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data of its own\nAnd that data will factor into people's social credit scores to the social credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until twenty twenty but we got a glimpse into how it might work because China is testing out versions of it in pilots cities across the country\nWe talked to a thirty two year old IT engineer named Sharon John he lives in wrong Chong which is one of those pilots cities and she joined explained that everyone in the city starts with a score\nOf one thousand or this you know a nicer my score as full score so so when ...\nAnd there's a whole letter grade system behind the points so for nine hundred and sixty to a thousand plus point isn't a eight hundred\nVersions of it in pilots cities across the country we talked to a thirty two year old IT engineer named shu run John he lives in wrong Chong which is one of those pilots cities and she joined explained that everyone in the city starts with a score of one thousand what if you don't have to answer my score as full score so when thousands\nAnd there's a whole letter grade system behind the points so for nine hundred and sixty to a thousand plus points isn't a eight hundred and fifty to nine fifty nine

reasons get a DUI that is an automatic downgrade to be and if you spread rumors on line minus fifty points if you have a really high score you get discounts and a bunch of local businesses your

terrifying you basically had to hurl yourself across the street when you saw breaking traffic but in that genre\nNow after um the changes have happened the cars and they will wait\nMinus fifty points if you have a really high score you can discount and a bunch of local businesses your heating bill can go down you also get special invitations to community events sure on John says it's made people

restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is now fair game and high volume what they call the end of political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Eric I Wonder if you can respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far\nPreviously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans hate is now fair game at high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Eric I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can't tap into something that wasn't already there\nI think that's a completely fair position I mean you know the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation in the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was an office as an African American he very much a\nSet off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet itself has allowed this kind of ...\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a\nSet off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet it self has allowed this kind of material to proliferate\nRadicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior areas\nSo we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nNick how do you see it uh there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe a there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general threw out to the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims we need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse in this is not um I'm not even talking about the\nNow is that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout the the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the\nRhetoric of hate per se um of polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people in America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty eight percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs those noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions we need to come up with\nA a political rhetoric public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level uh he should be leading the discussion in a way that has more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level uh he should be leading the discussion in a way that has more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing this um\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is\nWhat is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a ... a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera but in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think as you know as the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick how much\nWe give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back\nAgain recognizing that rhetoric is one thing and reality is another I think is you know it was the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick\nHow much power we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but I think all people who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence mhm those words weapons for sure and they led to a war\nAh you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about this I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it is hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics that places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of people\nI Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the ...\nThat's I guess is it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it as hate filled is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then in that policies that actually work for the benefit of of people\nI Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps my looked like next so we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets and I will try hard not to use the term ... media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and and thanks to those of you who've commented who has been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to the twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to\nHave been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up let me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to the twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone addressed the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nThey have permeated our society and uh finally elected their leader which only embolden them Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of a of a role various media outlets plan this\n... great question and I think that and there's a little bit of a historical big picture that and\n... Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that going back in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of an oval various media outlets plan this\nIt's a great question and I think that um there's a little bit of a historical big picture that um maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is the reciprocal rule that used to exist between the president and the press\nUm it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured a and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the

um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that\nIs especially cable news has been complicit I think in\nIn amplifying his message or you know on Twitter he has followers many of them are bought a but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his

media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question\nDrew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent and denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally\n... from what she can you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president has denounced the violence I mean the first statement he made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred in all its forms\nBe responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent and denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally stripped\nFrom a tree or can you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president has denounced the violence I mean the first statement he made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred melts forms\nThen in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday I think\nHe said there were good people on both sides ... I Wonder how you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least in a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address that question of responsibility and if we have a moment that after answer\nAnd so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that um but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial and in these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility um if we have a moment jumped up after answer\nI'm so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nUm but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial I'm In these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge um what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julie coffee in GQ um and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nUm and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know this is on CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people right or he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this um and then he\nBoth things to her um and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know this is on CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people right or he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie off he had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lies about me\nUm and then to accuse other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy\nUm and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nUm he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable this\nTo these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nUm he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility I'm an admitted that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective the Jennifer's in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this I'm just kind of wondering what your take on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue you call all the people who elected him supporters enablers of a demagogue\nHas been wrong I Wonder how effective the Jennifer ... in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this I'm just kind of wondering what your take is on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America he won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue\nYou call all the people who were elected him supporters enablers of a demagogue at a time when something like this happens that's got to make it harder to have to kind of debate we need to have about ... about refining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term\nSo um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first ... of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is the etymology of the word\nWho defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word for his fans for his followers and his voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as\nOf the people which is a the etymology of the

what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but his specially in a democracy\nPolitical scientists and historians who are concerned about the health of American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he\nI think so\n[laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an an accountable leader is a danger in any political community but it's actually in a

which are are grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHeidi I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nHas heated up in both directions many on the ride her pointed to the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is uh\nHeidi I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse as just heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left\nSaying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of
