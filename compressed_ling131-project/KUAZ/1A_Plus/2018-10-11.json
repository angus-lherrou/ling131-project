day\nIt's so good to be here tell us about the book's title on the other side of freedom what's the title about what are you trying to say there\nYeah you know I used to travel much more around the country talking to young people talking to to older people and what I realized that we have a deep understanding of decided freedom so we know on this side of freedom a third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know that we're as more people for marijuana than all\nViolent crimes combined we know so much about ... freedom and we have a lot of work to do that I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy in the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is at its core it's not only the essence of oppression\nPeople talking to to older people and what I realize that we have a deep understanding of decided freedom so we know on this side of freedom a third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know that we're as more people from marijuana than all\nViolent crimes combined we know so much about this side of freedom and we have a lot of work to do that I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy

and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come into the air we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the other side of freedom came from in the case for hope is that I think the hope is this your for all of this hope is that belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today's and when people say\nThe system is broken and then in response and people say oh no it was designed to be like this my takeaway is that it was designed and because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work of hope\nAre a lot of questions that our listeners wanted

ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny I like don't myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild\nDream of catching the host of the podcast pod save the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope one by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism [noise]\nUh you know it's funny I like don't can myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because it was urging everyday like everything that they had to show up as I taught sixth grade math everything they had to show up in our math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lotta math or anybody who's ever been around eleven year old\nUh what I learned there were a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and can be repeated back so much skill was like what I learned was not only how to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know when you didn't touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they can put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding\nGet down into pieces that are can be consumed and could be repeated back so my skill was like what I learned was not only how to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know when you didn't touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they can put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding like what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impact so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggled and like they can get it like anything lower than zero there like I don't get it by the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was like understanding like the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I mean think about the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got their\n... and that like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worst teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing\nUnderstanding like the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is that we think about the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd that like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worst teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know they might not believe they might not know how to use them and what I can do is help them find them and then use them long after we're gone\nLet's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nSo when we think of the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that uh you know for\nCentral leader so how does he you direct\nHow does he viewed his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nSo when we think of the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nAh you know for those of us who were industry in for a gift and we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who\nCaught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that uh it was organic they were set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the she for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that as a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nThat I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work\nThat we were the street for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized every body the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs it I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protests\nAre so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nOne of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people helps his sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's I guess most of the people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat a catalyst for the protests there's just not a true narrative\nSaid all the protesters every night or the the people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing and the movement or that there's a small set of organizations who like\nWith a catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end Emily seep in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the ... the legal defense when that was public I did it 'cause it was important in\nIs any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nIt's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked so like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N double ACP legal defense and that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's what the book specifically\nBut in general this basic I'm mindful of ... when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofits and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first day to be a police shooting contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done ever before continue to support organized\nIt's sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked so over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of non profit and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we thought was important right so we created the first oh the database of police union contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not pay you know I'm a salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nUh in with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense\nUm and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit\nA complex to like fund our work to do this really well ah\nAnd you know it's like I ... at the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not\nSam and Clinton to be a part of it they get paid as a part of the ... I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some huge money maker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on the nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's like I ... the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I Do have you know it's like a [laughter]\nNow late at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nOnly this only a couple of months ago was the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of a mess deck and parents up in the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us is you know who wants to get married in the in the basement of their second parents that's not sustainable so\nSo but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made it gets ill in dollars and it's like well no you like see me on the news you human a pie cast you like see me out of an event that\nI have essentially been thing in the basement of a like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their right second parents I thought this was a\n... but it's like it's the right way

leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope we're trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after

adult who would gravitate toward active as\nYou know it's interesting uh this is the first time I'm saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk\nAnd I just haven't had like having them with the right back yet so hopefully I write back soon\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the ... I can remember and now with that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like uh\nThe chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name him one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are as we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nCore part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of their identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass one would not ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints said like the constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can start to imagine things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you think about the diversity in the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the ...\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints semi that can strength to become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can start to imagine things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my mother never seen the writing the left is at the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the laughter always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you into the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote I think about the quiet\nIf you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was in Port in for me to be out and very very um [noise] I mean amount for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\nSort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was in Rio Grande like I was in the quiet and the closet and\nImportant for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\nSort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real right like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd uh you know I I Walk into every room as a black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected with them in social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about my own identity I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt with ... in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed up as you said that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later they realized that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me I'm\nSo like you know speak\nAnd that's not something that only I Know um but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed up as you say that this happened and and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later they realized that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me I'm\nSo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives in like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my all their career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner\nThat that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out for most of my own air career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my than it even they have to\nBe yeah you know like\nI think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that does not two ways to be gate and like\nThat's why the pride parade has been really really long [laughter] they're like yeah so like sometimes it is me wearing rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there definitely people who are frustrated\nThink we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up as gay that like it is not one way right that there is not to waste to be gay they're like\nThe ... pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me who feel like I'm not getting enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues publicly as possible and like he was one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now and trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people when people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that\nOr did they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin friend re like that they actually are nervous about privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that\nOr did they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin friend re like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about that every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right um\nSo the other thing I think that there's some people who like a really homophobic but like me and that's not helpful that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your heat\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling me a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nNo it's like a both and drape that like you know what's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in the system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support
