tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products available in the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage\nMore than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is that good\nThe plans were limited to just Ninety Days now the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA policies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more\nI get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible is met\nSo people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million

Iraq has been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen nineties to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\nAnd Thursday interest joins us now from the Kurdish city of ... gene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Curtis parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it's aimed at young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most fun of people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately he fought using the officers making these calls have you\nExist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people and it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most of the fun of people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately for using the walkers and making things ...\nInside the most almost lost\nAnd by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties so what does that mean do people was turn out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has almost been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejected\nWent early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are actually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations\nAnd we were able to watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballots [noise] because they decided not to do the automated their ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very laborious process right so even at this approved polling station which you'd think would be like super squeaky clean people trying to get in with fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nSo I mean we've heard for generations of how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very laborious process so even at this approved polling station which you'd think would be like super squeaky clean people trying to get in with fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations I Hope the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government\nAnd the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy is so it's all ... up in the air but um yeah a lot of challenges ahead for whatever emerges from this new government in the next couple of days\nNPR's Jane Arraf in the Kurdish city ... thanks so much time we appreciate it\nUs says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after

particular clip I saw on CNN was when I'm One of the senators and was questioning him about er an FBI investigation\nAnd he refused to answer he falls silent as he he he explained that he was hoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit he personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch\nHis wife or her

investigations\nYeah you're you're actually yelled at your friend that was enough that Senator Durbin of Illinois rights have enough and\nThere's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nKnow David I appreciate your calling in thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jump back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell the question or for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed as a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday

of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired and Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court at administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party and I'm often times or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try to put that to\nEqual justice under law well I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices\nCome from the political world they work for president of one party and I'm often times or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try\nTo put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court\nAnd focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but I think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed\nHe is a successful justice well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas\nFrankly a is today if you ask the justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so and Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think\nGet beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two let's get another voice to our conversation\nJust as well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas frankly a is today if you ask\nThe justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so and Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nLet's get another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drove the president of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law firm and think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth walking ... let me start with the question that I began with\nFor professors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimony as we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh and how that might affect the ultimate big decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the presentation that judge Kavanaugh I made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering\nFord and judge Kavanaugh but how that might affect the ultimate decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and as we saw in judge Kavanaugh's opening censoring the political\nTalking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for anonymity you know I think that ah whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect the clear request for anonymity from\nThis traumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to make this part of a political gain\nWhether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have tried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect to clear a request for anonymity from\nThis traumatize survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to make this part of a political\nGain game like she came up with this decades long ... on\nTo try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to her and her experience\nAnd to the many many many many\nOthers who have experienced sexual assault and have not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nWonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there have emailed the Democrats\nThat fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nI Wonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there\nHave emailed the Democrats are showing their ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but that would require morals which they lack\nAnd Joe emailed I'm a moderate conservative as are most of my friends we've discussed the Kavanaugh hearings and Democratic senators behavior extensively if the Democrats think their behavior will go unanswered I'm afraid they're mistaken this entire process needs to be overhauled\nWell I think that most people would agree that the nominations process for the courts both the lower courts and the Supreme Court is broken and you know it it's it's certainly a problem but I think that that's kind of a dodge you know okay let's talk about that\nBut let's first talk about Dr Ford and her very credible testimony and allegations and what it means for judge Kavanaugh getting a job promotion\nThat that's kind of a dodge you know okay let's talk about that\nWell let's first talk about Dr Ford and her very credible testimony and allegations and what it means for judge Kavanaugh getting a job promotion to the Supreme Court I think it's very important to note this is not a criminal trial no one is at this point trying to hold

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the ...\nA court of law you're absolutely right about the senator Blumenthal and it was very impressively pronounced as well [laughter] over the weekend I have a nice um\nAnd ... folks are are tweeting an opinion that judge Kavanaugh wrote involving Guantanamo Bay detainees where he embraced the same principle and said if you lie about one thing you lie about others\nNow a rubber ... Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the ledge misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about a emails involving lower court confirmations of surveillance programs and the evidence tested he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho is your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr Ford describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe\nAnd the evidence suggests that he did so regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that I'm small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho is your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence\nI should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this from across the country\nAnd even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press beat to sue ... what do you decide the opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court\nWe've been getting a number of voice mails and messages about this from across the country and even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press to sue ... what do you decide the opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court\nAnd its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body the shock is not at the partisan tones of the hearing the right left battles are left right battles happening here too\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues and the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember\nOur conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to do is I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward I Wonder a professor for its Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means\n... himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of

is I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward\nI Wonder a professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means for just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling\nThis well after last presidential election I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken part is and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame as the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia passed away\nWas unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats for retaliating um with this nominee a and what's so uh I really think that in in order to make the system\nWorked better we're going to have to come up with some major overhauls and\nAnd um and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame as the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia

better we're going to have to come up with some major overhauls and and I think the one solution\nTo kind of restore the dignity George additional confirmation process is it's a big change but I think it's necessary change I think we have to ask do we think Supreme Court justices should have life tenure\nIf they didn't have served forty years it wouldn't be Armageddon every time someone retires and there's a replacement if presidents had a knowledge that every two years they would get a Supreme Court nomination we would normalized this process\nAnd it would become more I'm sane [laughter] um and law professors have been proposing this Eighteen year term for Supreme Court justices yeah\nTime you have her I've I've I've heard I was with I was just gonna ask you about that I've heard that suggested that\nAnd there's a replacement if presidents had a knowledge that every two years they would get a Supreme Court nomination we would normalized this process\nAnd it would become more I'm

that I've heard that suggested that if it was Eighteen years you know there are nine seats and you know every two years basically see what come open kind of like clockwork\nThat this might not be quite so much like oh we're making this decision that one of the fact that our children and our children's children it would still be a big deal but you know Eighteen is less than thirty or forty the question is whether or not that's politically viable I Wonder if that just depends on whether we American people are willing to\nPound the table and demand it until the law changes it's not impossible to change the law it's just difficult but what what do you think\nYeah I mean I think that's probably going to be an unlikely a proposal for the particular set it up right now and but you know I think that this isn't just about the Supreme Court in life tenure because [noise]\nI Wonder if that just depends on whether we the American people are willing to pound the table and demanded until the law
