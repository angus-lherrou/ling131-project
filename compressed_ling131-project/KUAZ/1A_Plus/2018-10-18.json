are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it

with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is Mitt turns are usually about activist they're usually about the\nHardest core a people within the party but in fact\nWe're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who is really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a

voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest we're seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder Juana Summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip\nHouse shirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political\nTexas focused on the house for example how many

look across the landscape suggests that they're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to\nFolks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say may show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there was a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and midterm years\nIs

hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan a congressman who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pick up a ... or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three of turning the the House bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue way was the

that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive\nDespite all the talk of Kavanaugh you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter

Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and

New York so often on the shows people food the Republicans or Democrats\nTerribly advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on that theme was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what John left in our inbox\nThis is John raise Syracuse New York\nSo often on the shows people say the Republicans the Democrats the Republicans the Democrats the Republicans said instead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies\nNamely the Democrats that stand for such and starts the Republicans that stand for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain

mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did or regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans in how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message\nPresident

they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight

and it really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think\nComing midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advice to go high when opponents go low

just in New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire the Democrat now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running\n... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined who're nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven so I'm Sorry you just\nAnd when we talk about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been

of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings had been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll\nAnd you know they are going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nThere are some races where you know women are making

numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates a certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative women from the local those
