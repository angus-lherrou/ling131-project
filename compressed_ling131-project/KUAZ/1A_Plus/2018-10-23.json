A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted\nIf a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nThat's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad thing\nDo what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders I get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said are effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders\nThat day I retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better I think we want our leaders\nTo make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nFrom our leaders what should we want from our leaders\nThe dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better I think we want our leaders\nTo make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be the military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today in the book\nBut at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say our wheat demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors\nAnd the leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is change the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe but what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty\nOn Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is change the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and I would therefore be the star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhat I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are but all the other things in the situation or putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the least\nThings I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhen I concluded was the leaders still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are but all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven dwarves so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nIt's very common I mean if you think about it every body a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it cost him huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one we're speaking to general stand\nHe kind of wanted it that way it's very

in Nineteen forty one\nWe're speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders miss and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they

and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comments she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes and the five levels of leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself\nIn other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profile weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves
