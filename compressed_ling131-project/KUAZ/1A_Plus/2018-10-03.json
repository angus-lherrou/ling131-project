nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations residents of sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo always means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nAbout a dozen they've been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty was Britain and then Lyndon Johnson\nWell out of a hundred and sixty three nominations that presidents have sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have any means but it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they'd been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas up to chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate\nAfter a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John round off in the house of representatives said hid wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\nBut then the Senate failed to go along and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth or Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nJohn Randall off in the house of representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew um but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons and that\nLeads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth to Connecticut I was wondering two other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIf so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots of judicial plans and various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit both\nAre there been talk of an Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much thank you seems commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and the government work by tweeting us with the

tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others\nUm voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters\nOur backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily and there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others\nUm voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ... workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five mhm\n[noise] the way I see it this week the living wage movement to three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um that the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers I'm sad really than minimum wage protects workers is two dollars and thirty\nHopefully five ... the way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um the the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nUm federally than minimum wage for tips workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents\nTechnically if you don't make enough tips to bring that ah wage up to the the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district I'm voting\nI've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face rampant sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system\nUm the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nA Michael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with\nWorkers versus management in a fight like this are the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing before the council voted on this\nAnd people who are trying to get a fair wage for this honorable sector of the workforce Michael Saltsman and what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I\nI think in this case you had a situation where the interest of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it went until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those were there to support it and I I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is\nIs is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in DC\nUh according to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are already doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together\nAnd said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that we're also going to raise the tips may win among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who says\nAs an hour I mean tipped employees in D.C according to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are already doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came

up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said we want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed to this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees that you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages in minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against\nIncreases in wages are are backed by business interests so actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents\nHundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think

minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against\nIncreases in wages are are backed by business center as well so I actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up\nA at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it or somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and Phil Mendelson that chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of there\nDoing that um because they're sort of put up to it or somehow that they're not real employees um I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and Phil Mendelson that chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated\nHe said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grass roots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on\nLet's pull back from the district the district of Columbia to local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wage is wind up on public assistance\nAnd

inequality and we're in minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap in massive income inequality in this country we talked about\nThe shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide any real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent on fifty percent of\nIts meaningful that in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men that three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bass us Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that is greater than the combined wealth at the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because just as well as increase\nAnd the

that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this

McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on\nSo damaging to our economy our democracy not to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really
