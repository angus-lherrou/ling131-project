Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing parties in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again or um it to 'em and well aware and thankful for your mind to it the early voting we actually has some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help or get a salvage solution\nAnd ah that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains that being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI'm I mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money\nAnd modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell you I'm a I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a lever\nI'm here and I spent some time together for two years ah making our way through\n'em and Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't think that the main then I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we begin from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull out\nInstitute fellow shit where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that to mean that I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we begin from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars I'm for health care which is by the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party or with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so\nThere there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me and trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice\nShare the same party or with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you know been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nUh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you mean criminal justice reform one of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with the law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nI mean so first I mean a a shape that shaped it a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked to a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when ah you know the the cop would come by the house and say you know

Hernandez or do you all are in public radio and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum Louis I Know our time is short but let me let you get in another question for the mayor\nYeah definitely a mayor I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign uh but you already know this lord is one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that ... sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent\nHispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting with black and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election [noise]\nI mean I think we are doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate or across frankly all communities\nPain or but you already know this lord is one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that ... sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent Hispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting\nBlack and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election [noise]\nI mean I think we're doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate a across frankly all communities um I've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... I think Trump one button thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando hosted in Yvette\nI'm I'm buddy quest forget them I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti\nAnd did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... a which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us is that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand voters turned out to vote who either one we're voting for the first\nSo uh hosted in a vet um um buddy quest forget them I'm a a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... baby ...\nUh which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us\nIs that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand bow to turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins\nIs the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there we're going to win because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against there are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Guillen so many ...\nPerformed very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins\nIs the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful I'm prepared to go there will go in because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Guillen so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps we'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida let me amalgam eight to questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nWell first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already have castle doctrine which allowed\nImpact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it and then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation miracle\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground or you know it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders 'em up on their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be clear the difference between what's talking about just by way of contacts the castle doctrine you're referring to\nBasically is that kind of your home is your castle idea that says you have the right to use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened in any where you have a window right to be just to\nYeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr a about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous castle doctrine already protect you and your home\nCarries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened anywhere you have a legal right to be just to be anywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home there's already common last self defense which means\nAnd places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the books where you've been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different ditched dream and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far um as it relates to what we can do obviously on that I I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case or to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and to help them understand how family\nAnd to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat to me is is is it is a stretch too far um as it relates to what we can do obviously on that\nI Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children and black and brown children feel particularly\nI'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin and the trace of ... the case of murky smug locked in\nA and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies\nBecause they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... years as stand your ground as a fan\nOf fans who runs for before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass a new one\nCriminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies because they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover\nOr for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... stand your ground as a\n... point before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say the ... so I Would say one yes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to\nDo things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these aren't radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't you guys in parts for our kids play and our and our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we've lost the common sense ethical balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment or simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades are\nDream these aren't radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refuse to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks you can shoot guns in parts for our kids play in our in our family picnic\nA that was considered to be too extreme we we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about an affront to the second amendment\nWas simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got her it was to us some decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nAndrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you making some extra time for so
