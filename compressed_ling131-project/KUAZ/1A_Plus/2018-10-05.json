west Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this about the age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the notion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this

politics for very long time as well good morning to you both in mourning mourning so you've thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of\nWeeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kevin gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\nWhen I was going to be a much more conservative part regardless\nMorning It's MORNING thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice\nPresuming that Kevin all gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court that would've been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well it was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man\nThat is being replaced and that will kill the court that was sort of like a balance sports sometimes\nMainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way to the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on legal questions\nThe other way to the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue the conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nGood heart even this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to in the rest yet to come\nThere are three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nAnd reading the law correct this would be well even this term which is so\nFar pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to in the rest yet to come\nThere are three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question of arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that oh that was\nAppreciate that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety cases in which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow the whatever\n... ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that I ...\nThat example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and and and many other things\nLet's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying this nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a\nSo that a minority cannot block a action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOf delaying this nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a\nSo that a minority cannot block\nA action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska another one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to a to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor\nIs that I'm voting yes voting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride Ron Elving it is but\nIt let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would you do that\nWell that the justification that people put forward as they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should here\nHowever uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride Ron Elving\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would you do that\nWell the the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't and\nAt the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor\nShe has not said that let's be no she did not say that and and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option\nShe may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's on like she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules were different when that sort of thing what happened you'd get sixty votes for cloture and then maybe only fifty two votes to pass in there you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote\nAnd win the majority clearly favors this person I don't\nBoats no but she has that option she may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's under ... does she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules were different when that sort of thing what happened you'd get sixty votes for cloture and then maybe only fifty two votes to pass and there you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote\n... win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with the filibuster\n... okay so we've talked about Republicans who have been out for Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was uh know voted least on culture\nSusan Collins ... Maine who was ... yes vote on closure but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the fact ... verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail\nThey are uncorroborated mutt and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here\nDoubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the facts free verdict of the mob and the media would win out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail\nAbout the uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the Senate will have the final so\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer to date with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now ... is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly email\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learn this news at the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours\nVoice into the conversation now more lazy as executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ... you got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learn this news of the fifty one forty nine votes to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the um [noise] uh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm but uh you know\nShe might be actually trying to uh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know deserves a vote I'm going to vote no but he does or about that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe Manchin who\nI think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a an his vote today or to his vote for cloture hum but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now\nUh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nLikely but possible and the other person is Joe Manchin who I think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a his vote today a to a vote for cloture hum but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now\nUh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nWant to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of

floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she votes\nHe's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate and then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage then they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one senator\nSusan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance denomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual vote would be on the floor\nTomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way\nA vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nBut the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote for a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word\nThe most consequential votes but the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote for a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word in terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is devoted let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to you here to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence\nI looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine years the vote and let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican ... can start us off you than a segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to your ear to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no ah certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate [laughter] I mean the the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allow us to Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she's a very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion or because of the politics of\nEither their Koch is a with a Collins or of their state with Joe ... and when we say profile in courage were just defined\nYou know some of the other states so she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't all Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profile in courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person\nMore so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion or because of the politics of\nEither their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with Joe ... and when we say profile in courage we're defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody purpose heightened state well let me last time that I'm not a sex which suggests that not as a Democrat or pro democratic same I mean that as\nSomebody who would do with their voting rights go against their base so when you think about\nUm what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor later when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with\nThe pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nThese three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mansion\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an out I'd still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people\nOn the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and

outright still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor but protesters\nOutside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake in an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday and must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\n[noise]\nSo I'm just continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\n[noise]\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of the kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure that\nFlicks here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't it a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody to be promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter is pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick Garland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell said Mitch McConnell said we're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody depressed\nPolitics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick\nGarland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even a hearing any Mitch McConnell says ... said\nWe're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with the just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never ... an island and\nAnd and Obama had thought he was doing a [noise] I'm a\nA reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick the lottery he picked a moderate liberal or a book and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland is no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody\nI'm a\nA reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick the lottery he picked a moderate liberal or of ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland is no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the O. J. we're looking whole month and that\nThat you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nA Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listened to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also are going on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and\nEvery debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick up your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen but when you're on answers that I've just I Wonder if they lose their head\nIs that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take\nOf an analogy of sorts Ron ah because we also a good on NPR News frequently covered the middle east and every debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick as your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen eighty nine\nAnswers that I've just had which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and ... and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started in Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way no it depends on what what a beginning point you want to want to set for when the story started to go wrong yes there are some similarities here and for Republicans\nNineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed and the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate\nNineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now depends on what what a beginning point you want to

the Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time they had just one at the year before they had one it's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they had lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan landslide and that was significant because they were winning in the south with black voters they were winning with African American votes\nAnd Teddy Kennedy made the case and other senators made the case that those southern Democrats really owed those black voters a long hard look at whoever was next going on the Supreme Court all along comes Robert Bork who was willing to quite freely admit\nTraffic updated support him

the debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes up put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there is at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote\nWhen the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical months' narrow is still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what\nWhat evidence do we have to go on as to the way she's leading\nWell look like you lay out here everyone's watching this court pet you know the final four voters and there is a possibility that people vote\nThings could change your vote when the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's their medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what what evidence do we have to go on as to the way she's leaving\nWell look like you lay out here everyone's watching this quartet you know the final four voters are and there is a possibility that people vote differently for cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nIs she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of Betsy device for education secretary in fact\nShe wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently and the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and pot tensions there's your health committee yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that

her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and pot tensions [laughter] there's your health committee yeah um well done she voted she voted her out

and for or against um\nDevice and wound up forcing a Mike Pence to come and break the time which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney had to come down and break a tie on a package of\nTax just a reminder that the vote today as a vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and you may choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christine ... executive vice president for policy at the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ... ... so what are you thinking about this vote\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting\n... executive vice president for policy at the Leadership Conference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ... come on and so what are you thinking about this vote\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting that in notable that there's bipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct\nAnd I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw\nSerious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nIt's yeah it's just not correct to say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony in considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republican or out of fifty one who voted no ah this has been a very very partisan vote in ... equally partisan on the Democratic side is not\nConsiderable detail but let me push back on something that you just ... you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing to vote there was one Republican one Republican or out of fifty one who voted no this has been a very very partisan vote ... equally part of some on the Democratic side as\nWell I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nA usually people uh want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote\nIt sends a really strong signal\nAbout how troubled she is by this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court\nSo I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote\nBut I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's procedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristine was shifts both [laughter] so ah at you and and Dianne Feinstein who said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone it it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it realistically now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public\nAnd I think Senator Feinstein honors her wishes\nAnd I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about\nWhich is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story\n... I'm thinking about that was it impossible for her to to a ball for your yard to mention it to someone so there could be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where senator White House\nSenator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about which is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story\n... I'm thinking about that was it impossible for her to tip off the FBI to mention it to someone so there could be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island or to the chairman staff and the chairman staff\nReleased the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could\nYou know share it with other members and still preserved confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as Senator Feinstein really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention in the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or staff have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who uh had possession of ...\nShare it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as Senator Feinstein really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention in the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or staff have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who uh had possession of the letter we don't know who else might have been told\nAnd in what way but in the end it leaked do you believe it automatically had to leak was there an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been uncorroborated and had an individual who didn't want to go on the record\n[noise] well I I don't know who leaked it but I think that what this experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week is\nThere are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone or who will suddenly confessed to a senator or they're interrupting in in an elevator\nI think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women have experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it\nExperience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week as there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone or who will suddenly confessed to a senator or they're interrupting in in an elevator\nI think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women\nHave experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good and I'm I'm really worried that\nChristine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter at a campaign rally\nSense exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere that they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nLet me ask about one thing along those lines from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julie ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic\nWho wrote a long article a touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teams but said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to\nThey won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked you know let me ask about one thing along those lines [noise] uh our\nColleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julie ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article a touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teens\nBut said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to take seriously and investigate these kinds of allegations a difference between that broad issue and the specific question of whether a specific individual can be proved guilty through some neutral process here\nHas there been some confusion of one with the other on this issue people who are concerned about the broader issue have assumed that Kavanaugh must be guilty because they're concerned about the issue or the reverse for that matter\nTraffic update is supported by mothers against drunk driving information and I don't want like mad five event near you\nAnd then walk like N.

of what the vote total was again this is one of two votes that's involved in either getting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court or not today's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nNext vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court we heard just a few minutes ago that Senator

Court or not today's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nThe next vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court\nWe heard just a few minutes ago but Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine who might be a potential swing vote on this announced\nThat she will side with her fellow Republicans on a critical past voted this cloture vote\nTo end the debate we're just double checking our numbers right now I Want to make sure we have the exact right vote total and as soon as we have that we will bring that to you for the moment we should get to one of Susan ... a ... she is literally leaping out for sure go ahead Susan ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who was voted no show Joe Manchin the Democrat from West Virginia\nHas voted yes Jeff Flake has voted yes Susan Collins has voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the cloture vote but not to necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on Kavanaugh\nThe votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who was voted no show Joe mansion that Democrat from West Virginia has voted yes\nJeff Flake has voted yes Susan Collins has voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced\nShe was voting yes on the cloture vote but not to necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on Kavanaugh because she this afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what those procedural votes me but I think it's quite significant\nUh to see the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and the Lisa Murkowski no vote if those\nPositions where to hold up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe from senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the next one will you'll have debate on the floor\nOf it goes on they'll bring that to be too close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm In which they will vote to confirm or not drudge capital\nSome voting going on maybe from senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the next one will you'll have debate on the floor\nOf that goes on and they'll bring that debate to a close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm In which they will a vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window hardly any time of\nDay I mean one of the things about the Senate as it runs anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have\nA a senator from Montana or a Steve Gaines whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk her down the aisle so assured his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nAh intrusions into the way of the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out uh campaigning and\nYou know during this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed whether it's the FBI and\nFor down the aisles so assured his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life uh intrusions into the way the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out campaigning and\nYou know during this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed whether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been an exhaustive did not go into many corners it's because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible and\nNot one of these votes that you do want to vote you have to do in person there was no app for that so certainly his [laughter] his uh his other life commitments can have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I don't think that we really expected it to go any other way than being essentially a squeaker right on party lines absolutely I think everything or just leading up to this moment suggested that even before\nNo and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and

essentially a squeaker right on party lines\nAbsolutely I think everything just leading up to this moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became\nA public and I think uh there's a a ... a larger idea on that David Brooks tapped them\nOr to today and in his New York times piece about just how part is in the judicial branch has become um we talk often about activists judges um and concern that people on the bench are not making decisions and partially but we haven't seen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that I mean if\nI if I may Joshua one other element on this is that it was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother tweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly\nIncreases the chances that she will lose her seat Joe Manchin the last time there was a a a reasonable poll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A
