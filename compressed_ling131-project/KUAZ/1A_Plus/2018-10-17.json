rules and I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear\nI respect that distinction\nI understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes and only by tribes but my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things does it matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage\nClearly it does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry that apparently led to senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior

disenfranchisement please focus on this\nProgressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you were in progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court at decided to essentially and let it go into effect\nFor the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election as you may know North Dakota is home to uh\nNorth Dakota what is going on there well\nNorth Dakota has a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court\nDecided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats in the Senate and us rep Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPolls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve center hike camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American\nAnd so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that in the north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea in the first place\nWhat kinds of ID are we talking about what what does the law requires\nShe had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nSo what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been um talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also because\nFox you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that idea used in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also because the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even it'd vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot in the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if you're a mailing address some are different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or else we're loving\nWould this would dilute the ones that were correctly cast if you're a mailing address as some are different than what you actually reside\nWould love to
