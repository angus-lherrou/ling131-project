is um\nI open it [laughter] I didn't realize how he he thought of Trump because we haven't talked about that so it was this the first time yeah I Know how to surprise 'cause then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how undemocratic Vietnam is the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a president basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you do them yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to the\nMenu ally like all go call your doctor you know\nTo ... the ... spoke about what the ... will do don't do ... to ...\nYour ... says yeah CNN regions drum\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder

but they don't care about it through a thing you did his CNN again drum riff off so both of them\nSo they're not there by s yeah boxing is clearly a fire and I don't know if your dad says the al ... and a lot I think it allows apple I'm Trump boxes like trying to you know make a phone [laughter] do\nYou think do you think the media is too negative about Trump that he's not fair to say that Russia

Trump worked with yeah\nAbout Trump that it's not fair to say that Russia interfered into the election in this country mhm\nBut when they know that why they don't last in before the election [noise] the way until drum both elected and they make issue\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with the Russians where that would that bother you yeah you don't you don't believe that yet [laughter]\nThey're doomed proven that don't need to believe them\nYou know I'm groove that I don't eat the FBI and ended up now ... ... no no no he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah to some degree on yeah\nThere are a lot of families who've been divided over\nTheir views of Trump like you hear like dinner conversations that yeah that go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one percent of them I clearly him strongly against you know what the president stands for but I\nSomebody who groom yeah\nThere are a lot of families who've been divided over\nTheir views is from what you hear like dinner conversations that yeah the go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly him strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversations 'cause they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother them because we have that freedom that's why my parents left Vietnam to be here in the first place\nOver the

has just plummeted actually just a couple of months ago the U.S became a net gas exporter for the first time since Nineteen fifty seven I mean we have so much gas and the price is so low right now that it's just cheaper to generate electricity from gas and it is cold\nA lot of coal plants retiring just for the fact that they're all they're being replaced with gas you can do gas for about a third of the cost it's twice as efficient and you know the feels about the same cost and its flexible which also comes in handy when you've got a bunch of renewables on the grid\nAlthough you know it has um diminishing returns you know every time a gas plant replaces the coal plant carbon emissions goes down but I guess still does produce emissions\nAnd so we can only get so far with the gas so if we want to go further we either need to employ some kind of you know carbon capture technologies or we need to employ technologies that don't produce a C.

tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of these arguments that is what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans I'm sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nGo ahead for them it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to add to what Alexandros saying look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of took him out um and I think it's very dangerous uh for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and that's that's ...\nAlexandra saying look

neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook him out on and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh we'll\nGive you the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections I founded telling the gifts that they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... an Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who've drawn the most attention of and the people who have cast themselves as Trump\nI found it telling that the guest said they've brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Ozzie and Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who have drawn the most attention of the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to come up here at least their favorite but sort of an all against all on the question of\nTrump another politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight and overworked came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname

the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\nUm you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably ah throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know try not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for\nAnd he you know try not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking him about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for work\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nIt rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans this this\nIt's like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nIran as a progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas shoes you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans business give us a sense of whether he moved to need a little\nI mean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think an undercover aspect of this race is the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go and mark a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party overall the strength of Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against ed a Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties um seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if better over work has been able\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think an undercover to aspect of this race is the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go and mark a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength of Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties um seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if better over ark\nHas been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ...
