numerous times that the Congress has the dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nOther political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd\nThose messages um are resonating a lot more with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead an old over his nearest

and and the guy who's likely to face leftist Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed like just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four\nIn Nineteen

ways of the past year\nSome people [laughter] most world uh Brian we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in\nMilitary rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people [laughter] both wrote a brine we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit of will

T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow\nUm is this anti P. T. vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not\nSee a friend that we're going to talk about corruption\nType P T anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow\nUm is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see as friends and\nWe're gonna talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're going to talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the votes\nIt means that they get to a hundred percent but people do come out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally uh eighty percent of the vote or show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time or one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important\nWhoever gets a fifty percent of the valid votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we both are not when they more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are to laugh from the left from the ride or from the center people feel obsolete\nPresident there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday or we both saw not a winning more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood ... and with people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are the laugh from that last from the writer from the center people feel absolutely the fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted there equal in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an R.
