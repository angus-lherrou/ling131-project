over this\nWeek we're talking about the power of the Latino vote in Arizona Lisa ... is a professor at the University of Arizona school of government and public policy I asked to the same question I gave him a letter what happened to the so called sleeping giant of the Latino vote\nWell I mean I think that's a bit of a misnomer there certainly the potential for Latino voters and Hispanic voters all use those interchangeably certainly the potential for them to turn out and vote and really change sort of electoral tie it's the problem is that they don't vote in high rates\nYou can think of a Latino voting is sort of a funnel and so you start with sort of the entire population of Latino voters at the top and then you sort of follow them down by well are they of age Latinos tend to be very very young in this country and especially in the state of Arizona\nSo age knocks them out and then after you knock out by age you start to knock out by things like eligibility um so are you a naturalized citizen are you registered to vote is another huge one and then sort of at the bottom of that finally you get sort of the small sort of trickle of Latino voters who are eligible and then who finally do turn out to them so they could there\nThe top and then you sort of follow them down by well or they have age Latinos tend to be very very young in this country and especially in the state of Arizona\nSo age knocks them out and then after you knock out by age you start to knock out by things like eligibility um so are you a naturalized citizen\nAre you registered to vote is another huge one and then sort of at the bottom of that finally you get sort of the small sort of trickle of Latino voters who are eligible and then to finally do turn out to them\nSo they could there on sort of the precipice of being able to change elections but at this point if there's not some sort of mobilization efforts that are really stepped up they're not going to turn out\nAccording to the census about thirty one percent of Arizona falls into that category of Latino Hispanic do we know how many of them are registered to vote\nYes so according to sort of data that comes out of twenty sixteen so it's you know a little bit dated two years I'm so about forty seven point two percent of Latino actually meet the basic eligibility requirements but there's only forty percent of of that thirty one percent that are actually eligible to vote and are registered\nYou're talking a lot about mobilization what is it that will mobilize that forty percent of the thirty one percent those who are eligible to vote in the Latino community\nSort of data that comes out of twenty sixteen so it's you know a little bit dated two years I'm so about forty seven point two percent of Latinos actually meet the basic eligibility requirements but there's only forty percent of of that thirty one percent that are actually eligible to vote and are registered\nSo you're talking a lot about mobilization what is it that will mobilize that forty percent of the thirty one percent those who are eligible to vote in the Latino community\nThat's the sixty four thousand dollar question um there've been bunches of sort of mobilization drives vote to let you know goes out and tries to get millennials engaged\nNow want to sort of the interesting facets of Latinos in Arizona is that they're high level of millennials which is sort of a double edged sword right for a mobilization\nFilipinos have lower voting rights and then millennials have a lot lower voting rights so part of it is interesting issues like immigration but you know it's been an issue in the past it hasn't started them before\nSo the question is what will in the future\nWe keep talking about the Latino vote and by we I mean you and I and and everybody else\nOut there is it a solid block or is it more fractured it's pretty well aligned with the Democratic party it's usually a super images\nAnd then millennials have a lot lower voting rights so part of it is interesting issues like immigration but you know it's been an issue in the past it hasn't stirred them before so the question is what will in the future\nWe keep talking about the Latino vote and by we I mean you and I and and everybody else out there is it a solid block or\nIs it more fractured it's pretty well aligned with the Democratic party it's usually a super majority in the sixties and Seventy percent who are you registered Democrats and leaning Democrat\nSo it's pretty solid in that way but that's still leaving that huge block of about thirty percent and a lot of those tend to be independent and those are really the wild cards there's a small portion that are Republicans tend to be sort of from different countries of origin like Cuba some from Guatemala\nOr their ideological divides within the Latino community that account for those percentages\nSo they do so part of it has to do with their immigration story\nThe immigration stories

I think there is a very strong segment of the Latino officeholders who are those down about candidates but we are seeing nationally sort of a move up words I mean we have some sort of my odd as

is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money is at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic

to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just

listen to this program but we are not questioning the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLarry tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck\nThis storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to

break\n'em there are existential risks that are opposed not just to\nA community is close to the coastline to what we're talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about survive ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there\nAnd there is an element of risk that you take that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change is a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leader\nTammy in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability

the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... ... one small point just to end it if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international needles leaders generals like Colin Powell advisors had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when

president Shane what is your read on Nikki Haley's resignation announcement do we take it at face value is there more at play here what do you think\nYeah there's always Marta ... particularly in this White House um it was a surprise there is no doubt about that it was a surprise even to people in the administration uh Nikki Haley [noise] also I think I'd found herself increasingly politically isolated in the power centers of foreign policy\nAnd the administration with John Bolton the national security advisor and Mike Pompeo now secretary of state\nA sort of absorbing a lot of that energy and then of course this administration being quite hostile to the United nations being UN ambassador is not necessarily the most powerful position\nUm Nikki Haley has presidential ambitions I she she said today or an ... meeting with Trump this week she's not running and twenty twenty she plans to be campaigning for him a twenty twenty four is not that long the way a and I think there's\nNational

guessing she may have thought get out before the midterms\nI'm there may be of demagogue certainly of Democrats take back the house they're going to become a subpoena factory this administration will be under investigation relentlessly and Nikki Haley herself is under scrutiny for a private jet flights that she accepted from friends and associates\nThere's been some investigation to that um it might have just a ban that now is the time to head for the exits and and I have to say she really does leave\nI'm probably one of the best positions of any senior Trump admission official she's not leaving under a lot of scandal uh she won generally plaudits for her work at the un she was seen as a stabilizing force within an administration that many people feel needs them\nPrivate jet flights that she accepted from friends and associates there's been some investigation to that um it might have just a band that now is the time to head for the exits and and I have to say she really does

Nikki Haley this is not her swan song\nLily that was exactly what was going to ask you about is this kind of how what you read into Nikki Haley's resignation compared to some of the other turnover\nIn the Trump Administration I mean it's not a precedent in foreign to US ambassador to the UN to search for a year some serve for three or four years some surfer one year or so\nThe sheer duration of her term isn't necessarily telling but the uh I I don't know that we view this in the same light as say the way that like Rex Tillerson left some of the other people in this\nAnd feel like that's a great point I mean frankly two years seems like a natural timeline as for for somebody to serving\nThe Trump Administration I mean it's not only across it entered former U.S ambassador to the UN to search for a year some server three or four years so I'm sure for one year or so\nThe sheer duration of her term isn't necessarily telling but I don't know that we view this in the same light as sue the wave

Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories won a ass W. A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nOffice it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say ah that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races\nAnd house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be\nIt seems to have had opposite effect certainly so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races\nAnd house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state actually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee maybe picking up an open seat\nTo now a surge for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races were so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that\nIt's in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it's had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nAre but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college\nUh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigate it a lot of this Josh\nHis drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January they will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like a Shane said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nOr the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church lily\nI'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill FBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face on how much intervention did the White House do in that\nBetween people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior to peers that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to to go to church\nOh activists you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on this face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this a supplemental background check\nReal quick also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection you can bet that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say is she just last night um was trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store and in from outside the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on them she's very upset about that and Trump attempted ministry\nI'll say it she just last night um with trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store in ... side the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on that and she's very upset about that and Trump\nAre tempted ... really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these packs\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics before the roundup is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just miss swift\nFor indoor sing to Democrats in Tennessee when he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hat for the visit\nAnd we're gonna have lunch with the Gulf of ... I don't want to put you in this\nJob by this guy who let me do this guy\nI Love this guy\nDemocrats in Tennessee and he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hat for the visit\nAnd we're gonna have lunch you were going to talk on the line but I don't want to say I don't want to put you in that violent I Love this guy right here let me give this\nI Love this guy right there\nNo county West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk\nI I'm not sure what to do with it I I'm not either\nIs it maybe a little unhinged he noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I see it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these deep in this like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is just really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there is a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make of it a behavior from us\nPolls that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but is also left many people scratching his head about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment and I know for for for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British and has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand\nAfter her post Shane Harris let me stick with you\nThe county's old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British and has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand\nAfter her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ...
