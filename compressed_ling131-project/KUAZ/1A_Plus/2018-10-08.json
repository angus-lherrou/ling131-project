mentioned that that Republicans I suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice\nWorth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business you're at but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women on for a lot of women out there this this hearing\nAnd that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in the political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business uh but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of boy moms who are are\nReally scared about the standard that Mona mentioned right the idea that a single accusation without any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized to come out to the\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\n... emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety

system is broken\nNot to that this is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene email urging contacted us and wrote we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel is talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel are making my blood boil ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nUh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nAnd I'm the only one I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics who wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the hearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in three and one in three women will deal with sexual violence it was a\nNot rape that that's way overstated sexual violence of ... so and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against their will so writer should be careful with a number yeah go ahead and go okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression\nSenator Dianne Feinstein into shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in ...\nThe one in three women will deal with sexual violence was a yellow not re fat that's way overstated sexual violence sexual so and that's a very very broad description Ron clued even just being funneled over your clothes against your will so right over should be careful with the number yeah okay so yeah the number is\nIs is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization all civilized society seek to cope with it [noise]\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences\nFinding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean ... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's but I don't see any way around it\nIt is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because of the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nI feel like this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show is a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics early on I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been\nI don't want to hear it we've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics earlier on uh I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better\n[noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the Kavanaugh confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in a court of law and the question raised and it was should he a\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that uh there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nShould he a benefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that uh men should base a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled\nWas sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court bar should know that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was\nVery high

disappointed\nWhat we saw I Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court but I should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical

weaponized for political gain and I'm Upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll have enough really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right or some say he will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate in us that meant this gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about in her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with precedents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not bred cats\nConflicting views from the right where some say she will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate you missed that meant this gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine talked about her long exploitation explaining

what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will drag the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nLook I'm because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured than some art cleaning\nUm I think it's really unlikely that you see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrow in at the precedent on abortion allowing states\nI'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester as I think that's more likely outcome on those issues\nMore likely that we see some narrowing of the precedent on abortion allowing states I'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and
