living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with rich Moran\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me\nI first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going by per se you know well I you know as I was reading in bed you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're while taking his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks of that or\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore so he ended up moving to a ball\nDuring this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account um while you're in the ... and his grandfather and my father yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh\nThe state and yet he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going\nFull bore so he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nYes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street\nHe was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody it was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nTwo days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are ... and he cried and I think maybe that planted a seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program [noise]\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now\nIt's a it's a process [noise]\nSo [noise] it's\nIm rolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing

what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase or over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has eventually and just because of turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so if we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTwenty four team we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nIt's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them and a

it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the\nI'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots in\nAnd Brian grim it what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know uh they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had require\nUm get their ballots and and Brian agreement what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a record or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting in them\nOr they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nProbably let me stick with you how does early voting worked in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handle voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it um\nPlaces are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who liked early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas or we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters who'd like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition at leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWell ah basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a microbe\nWould you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWell basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational or kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to ... ...\n... um you know and so uh you know a lot of people um like the system in Colorado but not everyone um you know ... ... ... ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already I'm now you've got to think about um delivering it by hand or just going in on election day and voting\nGlad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives\nSome in Colorado a but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November sixth tens and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is an object to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hand on election day glad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry\nTo be in

absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie to vote early and\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and why are they are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious ...\nYeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and lie there are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment for trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot ... what is being over sixty have to do with\nVoting early uh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to sit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three four\nHours and we
