to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and the poll I Wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change that do

on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like ah the congressman from some South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on Democrats\nOnce again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean just Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nThink one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter\nWe we do need to deal with U.S policy

example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] there is evidence that um that those protections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations and we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise] yes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional\nCarbon concentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winter\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there is cut and so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a\nCollapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nOn people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been awful lesions between ... glacial states abrupt warming into enter glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial states\nSo that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by the changing\nFundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been awful lesions between ... glacial states abrupt warming ... followed by slow cooling into glacial states\nSo that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sun\nSarah backup logging under changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial state last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like like bring it down to earth from it\nOkay so in the last million years the the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower\nUm it's a colder climate um and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift this um this piecing this um oscillation is ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate\nAnd that heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat was paste by the way goals and ... of the geometric in earth orbit\nIncontinent sea level is lower on it's a colder climate on and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift this on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate\nAnd the heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat with paste by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you this yeah this heartbeat this earth heartbeat but we hold too warm\nCold too warm it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat is off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right I like ... okay that makes a youthful\nPattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that\nI was ... her on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get\nExactly or at like ... okay that makes a youthful pattern that's been on that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was saying earlier on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof\nAnd um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have our\nClimate science what I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action published so former
