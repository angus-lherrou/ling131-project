taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire\nRange I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various talks authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do which valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business was off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than the valuation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed ridiculous to us\nKind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuations of you know five ten million but on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um\nWhere they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go higher they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nOf course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking\nWhether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce wrote on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the

the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we are talking about here that we uncovered\nAre um trust arrangements that the IRS has endorsed sometimes after being pushed\nBy a trust in the state attorney I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grants or retained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm

purpose of and pat invoices so Donald Trump in his siblings could start\nA kicking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kind of things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people that Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with\nThe thing that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of

we get into more of the details I'd like to get to one more comment that was sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the Trump actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nJeff from saint Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and her father I see this is a story the second part is taxes

W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this it it\nTheir job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality\nDoing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this it\nTheir job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the uh the ...\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw evaluations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on and the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire an in cases like that\nPeople were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional tax and certain things was paid when they saw valuations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in in in things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were ... voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nThat you report has come out Russ have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of\nThese allegations or is it is it too late or or their statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges\nThose have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law firm\nThese allegations or is it is it too late are are there statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute\nOf limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said arrangements\nIt's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump in his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax that would have been a business tax um and it would've been substantially less than it's ...\nFlying maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said Huntsman\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been\nFifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings\nI'm would've had to pay some talks that would have been a business tax um and it would have been substantially less than it's\nInteresting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the anchorman not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them pay but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nOf the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips at one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us ... that was uh in in\nLess than fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSo that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a money he own oath to lenders\nUm and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos his father's a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars bought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cast them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal alone that Fred Trump or had given his son to help him make that payment get over that hump\nWonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if even if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to\nAnd went back to queens with them and and never cash them so that was eventually determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make the payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if ... in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to full for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nWell big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it that potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so\nCivil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are that they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money that tote so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities 'em and other authorities could be looking at um where the food they have ended\nUp in in federal prison for this\n... federal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute it ... the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose

...\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has\nHas stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the
