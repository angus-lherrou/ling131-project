have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing\nThe problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money\nAnd something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty

opportunity\nIn their community and I'm very proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and

say have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor you know that secretary bank yeah which I completely disagree with\nI think

about the ...\nIdly by a while the president has done this or David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment with the leadership of of uh some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president and twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nUh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefits\nThat American companies who are engaged in trade are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA\nOne of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states is possible we've seen uh some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics and warehousing I'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals from the perspective of the American worker and how they can benefit\nWhat do you say to workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say you know I I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town how many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost\nOther industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics warehousing I'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that we always need to look at our trade deals from a perspective of the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say to workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say\nYou know I I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town how many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost I see immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American like the rest of the world is siphoning off\nThe best of trade and leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully cobble life together what do you say to those folks in terms of the future of trade here [noise] uh what I say is that number one I'm you know we need\nTo make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve this trade deals these relationships at the same time ah we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship um so the question becomes\nI say is that number one I'm\nYou know we need to make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time ah we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not
