the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talked to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are
