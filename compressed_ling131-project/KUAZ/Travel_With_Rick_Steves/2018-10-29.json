you're in New York or through and through however you wanted to find yourself\nYou know I was\nWith a very strong sense of patriotism a very strong sense as we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and\nSo I grew up like\nThe music I grew up around was Hector level Sally out crews and then hip hop in you know growing up around the brand your favorite hip hop artist would be a boy so hard\nI grew up around like public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you had like this late nineties boom of I like you have fat Joe ... a big ...\nOf all of these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is so\nUp around like public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you had like this late nineties boom of I like you have a fat joke oh you have big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is so intersection all and to me it's not even that we're trying it's\nThis is who we are and so what what it means to be American and what we grew up in like how we grew up around these values was\nMy dad we'd go visit family in Puerto Rico every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah\nYou mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it would be like ... and you were young yeah those are really good to

that as being a young enough\nYou know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress drink me was you know rice\nUm and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous was just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me

you'll leaning yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect the political tactics\nFeel like I learned it from my parents\nAnd when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nFunnily enough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around\nThe kitchen table but my parents never\nOrganized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think 'cause my parents have natural organizers they were so good at building community\nI went to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester\nDidn't live that kind of class experience because [noise]\nCome over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never\nOrganized or did

displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college so I started thinking about well I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity within the Latino community that as a pilot\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college\nSo I started thinking about life out it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself I wondered\nIf it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans have been seen the New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nDate a little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the use policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised you well working in New York City schools and in your policy field so much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rico\nSo what did you find what surprised you well\nWorking in New York City schools and in New policy field so much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and\nThe largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent of young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City\nSo I started to think well if the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities both ways to make them great and then ways that we can support them to be even better\nRight so I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than\nAny other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nIt's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are
