World Service with me how to marry him in each week one question for expert witnesses\nAnd denouncing [noise]\nIt's a sunny morning in Texas ... walking to work wondering she's going to find [noise]\nShe opens the door to her nine insight tens of thousands of one's regarding around in different books [noise]\nShe he is and to one another and slugging it dorms on him [noise] what she's seen could help kill the most debilitating condition known to us aging [noise]\nDiseases related to aging kill a hundred thousand people every day but a growing number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way\nOr the past few years research to carry not remarkable experiments challenging what we thought we knew about how ...\nBillions of dollars being spent all over the world in essence to extend on line\nAnd this week we bring you some of the world's leading were sent it to tell me what's safe zone [noise]\nYou'll find out what ... discovered with her\nIs related to aging ... hundred thousand people every day but a growing number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way\nOr the past few years research to carry that remarkable experiments challenging what we thought we knew about how life than [noise]\nFilene's of donors are being spent all over the world and ethics to extend on line\nAnd this week we bring you some of the world's leading was sent it to tell you what they found [noise]\nYou'll find out what ... wind discovered with one and one scientist was bust the aging process in our cells\nAs we answer a question that own if you had probably ... [noise]\nHow long can we live [noise]\nPark one\nIt's all in this case\n[noise]\nWe're having a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy to it we were born right on the spot in history\nOf ... that witness cool Christians [noise] what does adults have so many years then one day decided he'd had enough of tracing\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe're having a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled our life type in a very short period and we should really be happy to we were born right on the spot in history [noise]\nFirst acts that witness cool Christians [noise] he went to the ... so many years then one day decided he'd had enough of tracing ... he now runs the Danish aging ... he's trying to stop people getting in the first place [noise]\n\nWe'll end with aging looks like from the outside [noise] what is actually due to a ...\nWell it's accumulation of damage from the molecular level that didn't spread to the\nCells and tissues and organs and to the whole organism make kind of all the hits or that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing then Beijing\nStops and when does it all began when do we start to decline that is in the mid thirties this that and that so I'm thirty seven seven it's ... yeah now do you stop\nCells and tissues and organs and to the whole organism and it's kind of all the hits or that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging\nStocks and when does it all began when do we start to decline that is in the mid thirties this that and so I'm thirty seven so it's it's ... yeah now to parties thought Oh thanks for the good news [laughter]\nSorry and there's more bad news once we start to go downhill we go downhill fast\nIt's twice as dangerous being forty two compared to thirty five then again it's twice as dangerous as being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve percent every year\nAnd a damn the mortality risk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying it's about fifty sixty percent so if you really optimistic type and you could say that it never get any worse than fifty fifty\n... is increasing eleven twelve percent every year\nAnd a damn their mortality risk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying is about fifty sixty percent so if you really optimistic type and you could say that it never get any worse than fifty fifty\nYou can't see it with the naked eye but I'm light crude buying it all over an inside us most of it just made up of bacteria but it also contains funky viruses and other microbes to in the past scientists haven't given it much attention but we now know it has a profound effect ...\nThe studies show actually they are like additional Oregon on to us because they can't even friends how well the way they have\nAnd all his show powwow will respond to different medications and sometimes and make us sick but on the other hand they also play very important to keep U.S House the\nMain one wanted to know whether a micro biome has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment\nShow actually they are like additional Oregon on to us because they can't even friends how well the way they have\nAnd all of a show powwow will respond to different medications and sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play back in Puerto Rico to keep U.S House the\nMain one wanted to know whether I'm Mike ... has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three weeks so that makes them water from law does not perfect subject yeah\n[noise]\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you will to do was micro biology wouldn't live longer [noise]\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside a woman's got tweaked its genes to make different varieties and then sent them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the ones expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the money spent [noise]\nWas so excited because when we find him\nLonger [noise]\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside a ... gun tweaked it genes to make different varieties and the fed them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the worms expecting them to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find even feel cases animal and not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down because he just totally unexpected\nAnd how long did some of the ... about fifty percent longer fifty percent yeah that's extraordinary so you had the most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that lift fool four and a half four and a half yes I'm was that much more than you would have expected\nYes I think scientists sometimes we do research it's kind of like\nGambling [laughter] so we have some crazy idea than you know we we did sigh of way to test them but you never know whether your idea is ride around\nAnd those moments where you find that rates out that's the best moment\nFour and a half yes I'm was that much more than you would have expected\nYes I think scientists sometimes we do research is\nKind of like gambling [laughter] so we have some crazy idea than you know we we did sigh of way to test them but you never know whether your idea is ride around\nAnd those moments where you find that rates out that's the best moment\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different microbe ... give worms will Tony a longer life but a better quality of life in their final days\nSo the way we do a way kind of look at how well they they have when they're older because worm when they're getting older their physical activity has declined so they move slower and also become a little bit of coordinated\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly ... [noise] and she's right and you can tell the room while younger ones regal energetically around them the older ones moves loaning the skin sucking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they show rank was but it can tell their body structure is not as good as it used to be\nA little bit of a card and\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly ones [noise] and she's right you can tell their own blog younger ones regal energetically around him [noise] the older ones moves loaning the skin citing as they go [noise]\nI don't think they've shown rank house but it can tell that body structure is not as good as it used to be\nThe ones with the new microbiomes most any Rickles around will quickly and their old age but they were less susceptible to disease to [noise]\nMake wine is now carrying out tests on mice to see what the changing them like ... extend satellites and so there's a chance that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us\nSome of my colleagues say oh hey you know I think people can they've ... say ... years so personally I think why jak for me is already the number [noise]\nLong can relive full [noise]\nTo be heard about ... to ... get us to a hundred and Seventy five\nAnd how it different micro biome to give us fifty percent more time on us\nScribes pills which do the same for us\nSome of my colleagues say oh hey you know I think people can they've ... say ... years old [noise] personally I think why jak for me is already that number [noise] so how long can relive full [noise]\nTo be heard about all the ... to ... get us to a hundred and Seventy five\nAnd how it different micro biome ... give us fifty percent more time on us\nBases inventions er about the dressing the symptoms of aging not the cause well then if we can go straight to the tools\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nHeart for\nFighting you're so why do\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me that's ... professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. scientist whose work on aging as 'cause a lot of people like scientists\nBefore now it's a little bit of a holy grail actually in our field now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get him that I think it's going to be huge [noise]\nBut I Do oh\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people I have had got in touch with me\nThat loan hiring is professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. scientist who's on aging as 'cause a lot of people like scientists\nBefore now it's a little bit of a holy grail actually in our field now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get them that I think he's going to be huge [noise]\nI work all begins with the building blocks of all all these cells so\nBasically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues tomato different types of cells now cells get hold of some ... and say your liver kidneys whatever will be dividing to replace themselves with a kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would call ... and\nSome lessons comes from the lesson would send a scary which means to grow old and that's exactly what happened to these cells they grown old income to the end of the life cycle but instead of dying they hung around I'm putting in a destructive money\nCan actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence Sal will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affects all of the cells around them so it's almost like a self ...\nIt's chance of becoming what we would cool for NASA and its innocence comes from the ... which means to grow alone and that's exactly what happened to these cells they've grown old income to the end of that life cycle but instead of dying they hung around I'm putting in a destructive minute\nThey cannot communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence so we'll basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells ran them so it's almost like self saying I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a matter of time as I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... as well\nWow so it's almost sort of contaminating them with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around it and just messing\nAs we grow older more and more of a self becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\nWill send you do they make the cells around them aged Boston these innocent cell stop functioning as they should which is still to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension consent type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Henry's wants to know whether she could get these cells to still behaving like a little cells behave more like young one happened that was I had a new is that true in my life\nWe'll send you do they make the cells around them aged Boston these innocent cell stop functioning as they should which is still to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension consent type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Henry's wants to know whether she could get these cells to still have like a little cells behave more like young one\nHappened that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was still finding fates and we have some old files and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent ship it some of these chemicals on these skin cells and see what happened about a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me and when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to say\nThat they would still my old self so they look kind of lacy under a microscope\nAnd we have a particular died that we can put on a cell coaches the tens blue if that's an excellent\nSo when I was expecting to say is that the south would be so blue and still looking old and she will they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south to professor Harry said you've got the wrong cells these are young sales go do it again and it and she did and she\nIt again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she about man\nKind of lacy under a microscope and we have a particular die that we can put on a cell coaches the tens blue if that's the lesson\nSo when I was expecting to see if that's the south would be so blue and still looking old I'm not sure what they what they went blue and they had gone back to looking more not young south to professor Harry said no no you've got the wrong side of these young sales go through it again and read it and she did\nAnd she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again people about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly quite suspicious scientists and yeah they were taught to\nTo basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it's been a little sad that it's probably real\nHow many rogue city search uh probably about nine [laughter] she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look to to ask them to actually maybe you're onto something here\nShe done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenated old thousand ten men to young south\nAnd they said why loan Harry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the world is the last experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nSo when it comes to a lifespan obscene clone Harry's would be the most ambitious of on our expert witnesses instead\nHave human beings I think we have enough\nPossible she'd effectively rejuvenated on south in ten minutes young south\nAnd they said why loan Harry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the world is the first experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nWhen it comes to a lifespan think loon Harry's would be the most ambitious of on our expert witnesses instead\nOf human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan so actually what I Want this research to end up paying\nYou the new generation of empty degenerative drugs we stood away off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease what I'm hoping is that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once so that people would have died early will then go on to live than not loaded lifestyle\nSo how long can we\nLive\nWe know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song from what we cut that figure is lucky to write [noise]\n\nThe discovery of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace the damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro biome and it still costs cells aging how many years\nSo how long can we live we know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already ... from what we cut that thinking it's like to write [noise]\n\nWith the discovery of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace the damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro buying it still costs cells aging how many years ... to settle well if we go by to him bound makes predictions if you're a millennia like me born in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy five\nBy the time we get ten and Twenty one sixteen who
