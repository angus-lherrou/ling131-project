that the job was always always with me\nBut it also let me see my uncle that the fear in his eyes that the whole time that I was in that house he kept looking at me and believing that I was at the job\nAnd it was very very devastating for me to see and I was like I I forgive you said it in my heart and that is when I knew I forgave him but because of that I became much stronger and much more

started writing he told me I was going to be a writer he kept telling me what potential I had what kind of leader I Would be but I had turned into that leader and given him all of these\nIllnesses and all of this heartache so I said that I Would do everything that makes you happy\nAnd so in that time I actually decided to marry I was about twenty four years old\nAnd by that time I should be a

him he said that he's going to steal your light\nHe's going to take away your positivity and I looked at my father that is when he fully opened up to me he told me something that he'd never ever mentioned we were actually away from the family we were walking in a park\n[laughter]\nMy father just likes to keep surprising me and keep giving me all of this heartache why like do the same for him

seven years old when he had just started going to school and he had started discovering the love for his education\nHe would walk to two villages from his village and go to that one school that was really far from him one morning he was walking to that village where his school was when there was calls on the street just like a village life where everything is normal even buy everything looks chaotic\nAnd he was walking through the streets when he saw a big group of men standing in a corner and looking at something on the ground and his voice curiosity had him he wanted to see what everybody was looking\nAnd go to that one school that was really far from him one morning he was walking to that village where his school was when there was cows on the street just like a village life where everything is normal even buy everything looks chaotic\nAnd he was walking through the streets when he saw a big group of men standing in a corner looking at something on the ground and his voice curiosity had him he wanted to see what everybody was looking at and so he struggled to push everybody aside and go through that crowd it was a big crowd\nFinally he pushed the last person that was in front of him\nAnd he regretted doing that because right in front of him on the ground was a man and a woman all bloodied beaten to death\nAnd he cannot take this away from his memory his heart was beating so fast and he clutched his books again and went back to the street and went to his school\nUnable to take this image out of his mind in his class when he reached all the boys were laughing and playing and throwing things at each other and he just sat there remembering that image of what he had just\nTwo deaths and he cannot take this away from his memory his heart was beating so fast and he clutched his books again and went back to the street and went to his school\nUnable to take this image out of his mind in his class when he reached all the boys were laughing and playing and throwing things at each other and he just sat there remembering that image of what he had just seen\nFinally around forty to fifty minutes later the teacher walks in and he immediately went to the chalk board and took the chalk and he's like okay boys all take out your books today we're going to read this chapter and he turned towards the students and my father saw that his front of his shirt was full\nOf splashes of blood [noise] later he found out that he was the one who took steak and beat his needs to death and he was part of the murders that he had seen on the street and he had come back\nAfter that to educate all of them this had given him this one feeling of rage that he had carried with him all of his life\nFrom the moment that he put me on his shoulders to this

where he fought for me to uh to not to put my life in risky actually in his heart desired for me to keep doing it every time I fought with him he desired that I should fight harder with him to keep my fight\nSo hungry to talk to her father about the money she really wanted to marry David an accepted it however bringing both of their families together was a bit tricky\nHis family is extremely sweet and my family is extremely sweet but then my family started saying some very mean things about his mother\nAnd his mother started saying some really mean things about my family and they were sitting on two different sides of the world and seeing all these things without even seeing each other down seeing a photo of each other they just knew that this can happen this marriage can happen for
