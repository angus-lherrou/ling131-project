me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to come at a price\nIs the world's on track to teach anything like that target festival\nTo clarify up the report doesn't call for emitting the report also is a question that the governments have to ask do you see in two thousand Fifteen independence agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level and governments wanted to know what a difference between one point five\nClarify that the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the governments have to ask the IPC\nIn two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between warming off one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into ways in which global warming can be limited to that level\nI say just to be clear is the well on track to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is not on track currently the pledges of the countries that they have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions over time until twenty thirty whereas in mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty\nThirty said paint a picture of Warsaw the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for example for coral reefs are two degrees of

twenty\nThirty said painted the picture Walsh are the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems

about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions 'cause they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria

important that people understand that the Tucker and climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker and more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the

the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be loosing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to ten but some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an equate long term Cleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra

people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say\nThat there are no losers what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term losses but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing it may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get these short\n... cases I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise DC isn't it\nPolicies of training we've are emerging seventies all their high technology sectors that were saying it may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we cannot mitigate we have to me to get these ...\nCases if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the terms of ... we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see action right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy\nShe's on the television we're seeing massive increasing the amount of renewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we on yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the\nOil financial products or pension products have to be aligned with a one point five Paris target for example I can see that and I was in the parliament and not gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and I imagine a world that he is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is that real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it just went to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one this is reading an investment in a safer and sustainable broke and when asking the question we're going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with us\nManageable and how difficult that will be politically and say that my perspective is that real political will to make these changes not\nYearly yeah it was just want to add to this that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one really should not see\nThis as a luxury something that we do now because otherwise we could just go on the business as usual trajectory one this is reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for this transition today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay to go for future climate impact if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degrees of warming\nAnd with two degree of forming this is not in the far future does this um one point five at current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degree yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing manage so that they ... the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and enter into robots\nTwenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about what was going to pay for ducked down to route and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to be carefully managing managed to adopt the shield the poor of the impacts of food that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie wants to come back and\nAnd I think I wanted to bring together the comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a Ninety nine countries with renewable feeding tires Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are the how the other places to see that renewables and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he says making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instances agreed no but there is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most\nEfficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that it's\nPolitically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize that there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPatient coming down significantly cities is making it easier the reason to global coping price for instances agrees no but I Do is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's\nPolitically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing the renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive for what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications on countries indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's this investment ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it is not enough\nAh as they see reports is reminding us okay um but I Do think the point that he's made also in the report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not heard it's not just necessary for ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons I was only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nHer when we talk about culture's important we remember the global economy is not stuffing and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we\nI'd be the report is reminding us okay um but I Do think this point that he's made all the report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not it's not just necessary for ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons okay only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember that the global economy is not stopping and there were three big\nTrends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety Chilean will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next forty years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities the dock congested polluted um\nThe choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years eve we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the

polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nOr we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast and now think heat panel throughout

the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually accept the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the Trump transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make Monday's IPC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple\nSean and now the more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nLet's hear from Myron evil he ... think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team to the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make could Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations his level but\nI mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this little seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that uh\nIt is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they'd been instructed to serve the can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this little seriously\nOh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Julius I'm begging with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nThink there is a fact of leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they've used the science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that little warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office of the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they've used the science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not disowned that it is something that the American government her signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide rebate and of course that's true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states shutting on the world stage well\nIs very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSomething that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide gate and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states and shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI unimportant Lee when President Trump gives his

about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about renewables but at the scene that maybe just\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was

more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about\nRenewables but at the same time you just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing country should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happening studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional look in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help\nAnd so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel and doesn't this come back to the politics because in the post Indian governments of ...\nAction in India but it's not going fast enough and what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional look in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in help\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive\nIt wasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you like caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat in Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action just\nNot it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to save it going

mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is water the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or\nThe investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea to lifting the problem effect right and so I don't think developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you
