I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to a new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will be still be producing in twenty seven\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gets submissions\nCan convince of well I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal in the work but it or not oil we're talking about\nAnd say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will be still be producing and twenty seven twenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate guessing mission\nCan convince the well I think we have to see it on the great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on coal in the work\nBut it doesn't oh you know we're talking about oh yeah that's\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants with for example gas\nOr even oil they will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener refers tests to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually it's yeah ...\n... Christopher than in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the old tests\nBy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough so we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worse agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do you\nBelieve Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the vibrancy because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty exploration in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... when I was next fenced in and out came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about with climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNo China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it in\nAnd and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle\nThat now I Know what

richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good to\nUh would look at the time frame\nBecause college but says well it could be doing until twenty seven to ... yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big big job you're going to increase renewables about six\nOn I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third

job ... on on how well do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate target the Paris Agreement the target is that he lied to know where he smoked and we've been debating a those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built toughest new investments are being made into renewable\nEnergy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas and oil in competition with the whole as a politician and in ...\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how ... states being built in ... new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nAnd oil in competition with the do as a politician and in a country like Norway which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow on us as anybody else going to buy and well it's difficult in Norway but it's become easy I've I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify herself in this I mean a lot of people\nHave been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince the kind of\nWait and see important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of who we are and how we identify ourselves and I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince kinda\nTo look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you get the ... do so well uh you get to a perhaps if you're a lucky from organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to\nProduce it by making\nSome of our Lance part of that\n... de Soleil production instead of making foods so I mean we have to be realistic and if you want to have more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and\nWho are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that a ... that's called actually knew now they change\nIf not you have to produce it by making some of our lands part of that ... de Soleil production instead of making food\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that that ... that's called actually knew now they change the name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or\nThe same time we have to address CCS and sees you because carbon capture and storage carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... fleet ships successfully than no trial with ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to this is one of the great things we could use our universities for the algae is from the burned see is like no the ...\nAt the same time we have to address these yes and it's easy you because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and usage is both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... down of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like another new regions they construct them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are\nYou wants to come back and CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually ... just explain what we need to catch a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government they no way are shifting governments have spent quite a lot with a lot of money to try to make that happen\nCash or sorry it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away you know underground or under the\n... yeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now and I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't no way are shifting government so it's been quite a lot a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and CCF has been focused on in Norway for Twenty years so I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less than what you think of the program or if you have any

can\nMake really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of bringing that new technology

developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nVery cause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating in the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables notes to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration and stuff we talked about it was only to develop\nBecause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy is securities of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration and stuff we talked about there's only two developments and then will reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in the room so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually we had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can come and so forth\nSo we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with and I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think he would father study of renewable energy at our university which you can\nRather than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan cause fault no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the er and merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to hide the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expense and the a matter of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made that yeah I Know but it's ... it's it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you\nThey weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted that if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made up here I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't exist sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got to go up on a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument is that you will see now that you and you will ... will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting patrolling\nLook at China that the the speeds of ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument if you will see now that you knew about energy will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is generally grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board that terminal comes from the bar and seek comes from her first comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe\nIn ... in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas an older guys\nOn board that terminal comes from the burned seek comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to lease palace that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia and China and order and law\nIn there and see they have drilled about twice as much as Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard and the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily kit that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat is according to the carbon projects\nThere and see they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and love bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat that is according to the carbon project and if you see the court and Brazil has been originally sees this summer it is a totally different pictures coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe gas will exclude cold\nIf because of what you mean by that call them price\nThe price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nAnd there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you guest will push out cold enough push health renewables\nAnd to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid to be able to call them pricing now but also the way the energy system works\nThe president or be or to fishery low for a lot of years and that has made it possible Durham coupons in Europe too low cost one those prices are starting to rise then you go to will push a cold ... pushups renewables\nBut he's still a ... to ... to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are for example the core of approaching no but also the way the energy system works and since renewable energy so much more cost efficient\nWhen it's producing electricity than\nCoal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting guests to Europe for quite some time with a we already made those commitments but but this is about what kind of you do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have\nSierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in\nComes to two guests and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy so I mean we're going to keep exporting guests to Europe for quite some time in a way already made those commitments but\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have\nSierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector after twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with no way but it's a very poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people ... the the way in which treats citizens of the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on [noise]\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country there's going to keep it well see but with no way somehow lose some of its stasis is no way\nAfraid perhaps on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you're painting a far too short picture

but with no way somehow lose some of the state says is no way\nAfraid to have some some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you painting as far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before they all came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the has the only place in Europe which hasn't been any famine during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on and\nThank God we didn't have an ability we we have again it's hurry and society\nIn looking at a lot at the history and one important objective that's had an incentive is supposed to keep the moderate pace of extraction and when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit tripled\nAlways has easy

eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards we almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol
