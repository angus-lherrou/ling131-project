I think it's used in ways that are very questionable and that have left to do an identity often than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that a little bit more Adrian past what does it mean

you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of his very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you have any ... any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity

else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what heterosexuals want and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified it would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a white American goal and sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is um I was\nBut the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it but I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will justify it would look like last summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a white um how can we go into sort of dramatic life story they have no partners\nUm I was amazed by the way in which movie which tells in the mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't it problematic that this round protecting us how to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the right was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who he was enough of a different race we should celebrate that and it was part of a left\nBut some of food that was problematic size leave for me is the crux of a disagreement about what society one ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody is to stay in the lane and avoid cultural appropriation\nAnd I was struck by the idea of a sudden you've got to be the right thing\nWho cares if you find somebody who was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was possible left\nBut somehow forfeit was problematic exercise leave for me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures Robin where everybody is to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those on you but the picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably my real identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off\nWhy can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call um I've never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who isn't for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised\nA bit like a kind of cheesy a wrong call and I'm I've never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left on my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of\nCommonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we caught stone politics into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call model I Would\nFor you and 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of algae beat the rights of the way that's changed but feel free to come into ... well\nThink the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on ... special little\nThe texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness\nOn a an an artery social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity\nAnd ah you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word you might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Asia it's the end\nPakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not ugly or I dig it lies fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong\nBecause you might use the wrong word you might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's the intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together to somehow to differences defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out to be celebrated\nBut they also the commonalities that's how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and remind you of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus on that shouldn't be warm\nBut at the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow from everything else and that's the way that politics has become\nDo you live ... I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and lack of commonality and difference\nEven those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus on that shouldn't be warm but the memory simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's the way that politics has become\nSo the ... I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic a hand wringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nLet me give you a couple of examples of what I Want to make clear but I think a lot last night in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem with police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers is also true but the majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small ... off the oval American population but it's black so I think actually this conversation\nPolice violence in the United states and I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true but the majority of the people who are killed by policemen states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small ... off the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice but you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's\nWhite people who got shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new\nSituation that we find ourselves in why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nThe reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other [noise]\nWell I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves in why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee no longer function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations and the communities are not working and I think that's why people fail\nThis was a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center then too it's by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nIt's not to disagree with the premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a mono ethnic multi cultural self conception of themselves and thank God we've started to\nCentralized and I think the problem with essentially than Tuesday's fight uh finishing exclusive\nBriefly ...

inclusive enough they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course the working class is not simply watching a lot of other components of the of the Washington has suffered an often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people who suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who
