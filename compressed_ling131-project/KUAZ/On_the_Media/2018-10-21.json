whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissident\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened

player in the middle east in American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract that much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending a you know uh this one man jumped on and of course uh it really struck thing I think an

of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey uh what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... she's a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis\nThey have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated Dutch\nUh they need they need hard currency need foreign exchange the need investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by other allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the IMF or to one very clear about that and so\nReally depends on now countries with with with liquidity I and and just briefly\nDollar denominated got a they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange they need to invest meant they need investment opportunities and that's all something that's going to review and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to close sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was best known among many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so

years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official better showing the satellite is not true its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not nice about wild west ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just is\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that they are\n... who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army

the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear the ... the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move to both is where

students on this bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is that that a good was just too\nI Know so these two bosses\nWhat exactly did to both is that the army and they said that police it starts to ... see Steve ... before I mean these two bosses would that do versus what the students were traveling from their school to why why so\nWhen I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss the secret compartment as harrowing to me\nI mean and they said that police it stuck to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before it I mean these two bosses would that do versus what the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside ... secret parts of the
