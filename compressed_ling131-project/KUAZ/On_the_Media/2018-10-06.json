hurting the market as much but the problem\nAndy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose which could you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo

balance\nWhat you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] when I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented very very expensive cheese indeed\nThe government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was

how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding
