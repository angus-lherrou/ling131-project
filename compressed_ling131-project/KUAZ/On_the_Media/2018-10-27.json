built up I I just felt a\nWhat'd you do did you like run home and and and and sort of like writing things down or drawing pictures or or did you just kind of model referral for a while\nSo I ran down the mountain I got\nA new book and I started writing down ideas and then when we got back to Denver spot how can I take ... nuts and spices and turn them into something really exciting and I would get

banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining that's going to do a lot of cooking and you're in your kitchen would you create an art I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and you're gonna get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like being like Dicky ball of a match\nAnd then you would like to take it out with your hands and like I went out with a rolling ten and then\nUm I got to cut her and I would like to cut her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch\nStates and like nuts in there and you're going to get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like being like Dicky ball of a match and then you would like take it out with your hands in like a roll it out with a rolling\nPin and then um I got to cut her and I would like I told her to cut her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own image you have any cash digital sort of asking parts to help you out in that year while you were not you know we're getting a salary how did you pay your bills um within\nAbout a week I realized oh I I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought I'm going to start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know yeah so whole foods opened\nTheir first store in Denver at exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and they in in the neighborhood I grew up in actually and I thought huh I'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work and

with them I'm going to work and their nutrition department and doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself this is really going to be the big deal like this is people don't want one by these\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression so I first got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say\nI Would buy those and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world I mean to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds\nOh it was such a gradual progression so I first [noise] you know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say\nI Would buy this and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries\nAnd at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or she's going to work for a whole foods maybe I'll just do that\nAnd just just to clarify again how are you just like sort of\nThe spent like binding reads and stuff and and this was when you're using your own money you know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious at all I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all\nKinds of grain information in a month we'd go by and I would find out about a piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things and I would be so motivated at somebody want to buy bars and I make them a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags and a little Chinese takeout box\nKurt ... and were you nervous or anxious little I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all kinds of great information in a month we'd go by and I would find out about\nA piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things and I would be so motivated at somebody want to buy bars and I make them a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags and their little Chinese takeout box\nAnd and I would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow and then another month ago by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and\nThen I Would just get really motivated and nothing happened and this went on for the three year period between my idea phase and when actually launched so\nI'm trying to figure out how you uh maintained your uh your optimism and confident about all this because I mean you're thirty two you're divorced\nI imagine you
