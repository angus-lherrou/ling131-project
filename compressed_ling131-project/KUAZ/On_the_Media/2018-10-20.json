the ...\nIs not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the first French bakery cafe\nIn the Copley Place mall in Boston so you decided that you were going to make this a new experience new open pen experience where people could come and\nEat lunch and buy bread\nYeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right in almost instantly is broken down company became very hot ... people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened in Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we open the doors\nAnd what were you serving their um we were serving sandwiches\nAnd some soups made on our Britain course on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in ... on on a real French back at it would be a\nRoasted turkey and brie cheese um and I think what\nAnd in Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we opened the doors\nAnd what were you serving their um we were serving sandwiches\nAnd some soups made on our bread and costs on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on an real French back at it would be um\nRoasted turkey and brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing and I don't think we had the language for it back then but what the big recap I was [noise]\nWas an alternative between down and dirty fast food yeah and fine dining yeah and for people who were working in white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings\nThis was the first example of what we later came to cough vast casual\nThis wouldn't have to do something that was better but in a quick service mode\nSo so once you know surf stones idea of creating cafes and bakeries it was after the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to\nBegin a pretty rapid expansion well guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a bakery cafe we saw all kinds of interest in how we became\nTo cough vast casual this was an attempt to do something that was better but in a quick service mode\nSo so once you serve stumbled on this idea of creating cafes and bakeries it was after the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin\nA pretty rapid expansion well guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a bakery cafe we saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot [laughter] you know every major office building one of the French big cricket and we found we developed big competitors\n[noise] alright says something something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is among panic choirs is a small chain of St Louis based\nSandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you I had this like small chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn them into a bomb hands\n[noise] no I you know I I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to me several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing volumes homeless as much as we did within Obama pet but\nWhat what's the story there why did you buy this like small chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn it into a ... no I you know I I talk\nTo everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to meet several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing ... homeless as much as we did with an old bone pet but doing so in suburban St Louis\nAnd it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis bread company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in the suburban marketplace while oh bumped cameras are urban stress\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nOr so you choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing [noise]\nBut we rename than cuts up an air bread in all markets others in St Louis but we renamed it ... bread because as we went to new markets people\nThe St Louis brick company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nOr so you choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing [noise]\nBut we rename than cuts to an air bread in all markets others in St Louis but we renamed it ... bread because as we went to new markets\nPeople often thought St Louis was more associated with Clydesdale horses are now than it was with breath right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight you're you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where we could you expand beyond those original Nineteen yeah by Nineteen Ninety eight\nWe roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was having one of those moments that all CEOs have of self reflection and frankly I was kind of bummed\nI was looking at ... as one of four divisions in this multi divisional restaurant cut it open than I had a bump in a lump and international I had an error in Idaho bumped pen\nWe did you extend beyond the original Nineteen yeah by Nineteen Ninety eight we roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was having one of those moments that all CEOs have of self reflection and frankly I was kind of bummed\nI was looking at an Arab read as one of four divisions in this\nMulti divisional restaurant open than I had a bump in a lump and international I had an hour and I had a bump in manufacturing and I was with a friend and I said you know for every hundred people talk about having a nationally Dominic concept\nOne ever makes to do so is so
