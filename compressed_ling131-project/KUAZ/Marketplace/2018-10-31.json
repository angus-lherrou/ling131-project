S. speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said in mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division Bush struck by the amount of division\nHe is the story and I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who are on either side I think this is science of disconnect and it upsets papal\nIt's the same story everywhere we go on happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what we see and said this quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even for people who are very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency\nSo that's the hard road that I think Americans attacking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been extremely I mean people\nAre Trump supporters as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country you know why that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and they'll site North Korea is an example of that the tariff wars with China and the other side of

election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nIs a fascinating thing you know we're just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conduct a little focus group they're primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though China's not buying their crops the down by bad twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then which make two other ... that is well and good but ... full and if we can solve this problem out really soon begin to have another hobby snakes you may not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to uh\nJohn or is not buying their crops the down by about twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then would speak to other ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon we're going to have another habit snakes you may not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to a cold was kept out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride and but you usually motivates what people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in as strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and\nIt usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind and I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had one called polling Hansen she still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and ... but people in

if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance we're going to see how you guys and that's my main that the cycle blue light that's coming might just be more of a trickle\nHow much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region\nWell it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from

he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view coming from a president or somebody in such high office\nHe said it was much more subtle in

turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote well in this trial\nHe had never seen such overt racism and he's view coming from a president or somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt the roar exposure\nBruce you've been in the U.S before and

vote\nWilling to try and we have compulsory ... taken that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fond if we'd done but as science take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd then of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa rather than having to energize the base all the time if you are have compulsory biting your politician industry you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's\nThe people in the middle you have to convince and that means that extreme politics even though it sounds very divisible times still is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that on the ... the major political parties for example ah you know we have a national hills game which would never be touched by either at the ...\n... they buy all the time if you're ... you're a politician and astray you know that your

are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMore motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from journalists and others that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that
