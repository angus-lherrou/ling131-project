think first of all there was just the the shock\nThat gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning\nAnd it began you know just conversations across to each other with different

talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a foot on the investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more

they'll ... so many clues put together so it's not just the rage line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue and you have another clue you sort of bring them together\nAnd that narrows the

when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that and adding everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also worked with bell and kept the open source research group which is seriously experience in this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nOf all the government tried to deny initially that these were Cameroon and soldiers they said you know the uniform on was not what I'm ... the soldiers would way up north\nUm they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the union army will serve on some of the

divisions of the kind of Indian Army also found some of the the uniforms\nWhere indeed ... military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and found that those were Kembrew Indian soldiers but then in the dialogue is well some of the soldiers were saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy\nBut around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tone and said well they had the rest of the sudden people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official names and so we can match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details\nOf your parents still you know you don't show on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's\nThe rest it said and people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official names and so we could match that we can use Facebook as

Facebook you know we found a will to speak to a former ... soldier who also confirmed that this wasn't the Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out in the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these uh women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram and\nThere's a point where I Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of a tell this child that um you know sorry we have to do this kind of thing
