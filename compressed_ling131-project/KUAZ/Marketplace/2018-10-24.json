I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child not because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way but all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous\nAgonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents who have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents had criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not reunited\nVacation because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has new idea what happened to the parents\nWe are the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone we remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will\nAnd we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe EU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director at the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me

so important that quite opportunistic if one ... they'll try another if there's too much pushback then they'll be nice for a bit\nWorld power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it

the Chinese kind of fries\nAnd and for a long time they gave me the will trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months to trade tensions and you get this when you talk to the European government leaders you've been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike\nMore than an American led worlds trading order is no rules a tool and so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gaming the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they do want to do is to lose the system completely\nSo suddenly the Chinese are quite in the winter of reforming the company's CEO and no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of this one of these moving parts\nWhere you could actually see something quite positive come out of this\nWas it an American led worlds trading order is no rules a tool and so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gave me the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely\nSo suddenly the Chinese are quite in the order of reforming the WTO no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of this one of these moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive ... the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction or an absolutely confident Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because\nReasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down the list of people who can explain what comes to then they got ... down the list there are people like me and I literally have conversations with them when I say I'm opposed to it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese yet\nSo she says this was an ancient Greek historian heroes about when you had a very militaristic rising power

skiing everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese yet\nSo she says this was an ancient Greek historian who rose about when you had a very militaristic rising power spotter coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably lead to war and so he analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart and in a depressing number of cases that does triggered armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say\nThe Chinese are busy trying to get rich that trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stop this thing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of photons from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person these kind of ... ... kind of New York real estate guy I'm so they think that as people age ...\nThey are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for trade will that lead in a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of the funds from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person needs that kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy\nI'm so they think that as people it shouldn't go to war but the dynamics can get a bit of weight from you when you've got these two big big countries no longer thinks that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wind before trying to get so big that it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and bend the cup and there was this extraordinary and gold and Trump said I think it was at the U.N General assembly speech when he said the\nPrevious presidents have sort of been ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so soon that's really extraordinary statement in a previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure\nAs a kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big that it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and ... there was this ... thing Donald Trump said I think it was the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents such that have been ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so soon\nThat's really extraordinary statement you know previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of a member of the great in the good a hoagie international oil to along with everyone else but\nFor Donald Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric\nYou're just not going to rise in the way that you thought you were going to I'm going to stop it\nThat that is an incredibly bleak things with aging to hit\nDavid Rennie of the economist speaking with us from Beijing thank you pleasure news headlines are coming up and about sixty seconds this is the world and the world dot O.
