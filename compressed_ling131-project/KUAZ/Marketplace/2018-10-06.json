{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KUAZ", "content": "The numbers are there hey I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperament what do you think sure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who knew\nHim well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what time is on I had\nBy the way he acted like in ...\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy that this\nAssociation of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan\nJustice rally foreign sure one\nBrett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice\nThat wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut did that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there's\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what Thanksgiving should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\n[laughter] you know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank
