thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIs deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year's deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews\nThe mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome

Democrats running for Congress this year near where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans had a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two

to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right\nRepublicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been\nOne where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe

and it worked with him when he has done something right\nRepublicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years that's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I tried to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for below sea to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence and Washington\nI see is if the

these are people from party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like the Adams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey aren't calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election

in touch with Carlotta Gall is simple bureau chief for the New York times so Howard took us a visual getting their information and how are they parsing out what they know\nWell that's what's so

that's what's so interesting is I think they've known from the very get go I'm literally from the first day or evening um\nWhat happened was that the first week the Turkish\nOfficials 'em all anonymous all asking not to be quoted started reaching out to foreign media which was interesting because it's not usually what they do yeah so that then became a big story in the west and it was clear that that was that am they want it to be listened in the west they want it to be believed\nSo um it's been so they'd be they'd be cautious and careful with how they have\nReleased um what they know the details coming out by drip I'm\nIn a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when

in the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams in New York and they were checking ... to try and match them with\nOpen source materials social media and stuff and so on we found people

those sort of things we will to match up there are others that it's difficult to walk out who they are all\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is reported to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went to arrive in your reporting have you come close to understanding this\nUm no not yet I mean I think at first we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on no one this is a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against our own government and\n[noise] um no not yet I mean I think the first we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but [noise]\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on a new one this is a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against our own government and president I'd run himself so that's why that particularly enraged I think\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which although the sudden diplomatic deference they do have differences considerable difference it\nAnd so now you see in the

extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist I think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the costs of climate change will be going forward\nThat's John konger he

important to capture the distinction between a normal maintenance or repair versus the closer coinage of a severe storms so that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\nLook argues it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hanger roof if you know how much you've spent repairing hang our roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition if not
