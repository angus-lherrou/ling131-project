listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season tips off next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court not a player\nThat's right the athletic ran\nWho is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic\nCollide that was the shooter was made famous by New York Knicks great wall\nFrasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joins us from Portland, Oregon hey how's it going good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nYeah so they had it for a ... and it was\nSeventy three classic\nCollide that was a shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great won't\nClyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletic she industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they had signed just one clear and been quarter and yoga broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so of course that's a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players are today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much pull do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles\nThat are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big

and LeBron James is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any new comer yeah\nUm you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike hat about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay\n[laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed six of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an darned about end to mark his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back how\nBig of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball ... business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have it's really tough to\nPresident so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the ... is a big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media if you've gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that and MIT's made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting ... brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights audience scream and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nLift ticket to that and MIT's made it kind of fun you see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways\nHow these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting ... brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as

game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights audience scream and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million to bind followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so they're really lenient on their players accounts and ethics big part of their strategy with their shoes that\nThey don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes
