travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd pure as usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey they're allowed so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the

talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack are on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on this rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held\nAnd that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nReally seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks\nEvents happening right before a critical\nElection Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy uh that is expected\nBut after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign event where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac it's very hard to tell a\nViews of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nAndrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not

midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump or I seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll
