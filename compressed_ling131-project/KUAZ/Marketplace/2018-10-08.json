away so the message is indeed a very strong\nThat was Jim ... from the UN's inter governmental panel on climate change which released the report the rules Carolyn Beeler is here to tell us more about it or this report found as possible to reach that one and a half degrees Celsius target but just how hard would it be\nHard as you mentioned that reports authors hundreds of them wrote that's Freddy

target but just how hard would it be\nWell hard as you mentioned the report's authors hundreds of them wrote this for the inter governmental panel on climate change said there's quote no documented historic precedent for the scale of the economy wide changes we'd have to make to cut emissions enough to keep global warming to one point five degrees Celsius\nThat's because we have to cut carbon emissions roughly in half in roughly a decade and would actually have to reach net zero emissions in just Thirty years\nI just want to underline how hard that would be to do it basically means that we have to reduce carbon emissions enough by twenty fifty that anything we met we can then sucked back out to the atmosphere by planting trees are taking other steps so that would be a huge undertaking\nYeah I mean people are already talking about how hard it is why Carolyn has this report focus exclusively on the differences between one and a half associates and two so she's in other words this is the difference between about three degrees Fahrenheit versus three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nBecause those are the two numbers that are written into the twenty Fifteen un climate change agreement so for a long time two degrees Celsius was sort of thought of as this kind of goal but in Paris at the un conference in\nThey're taking yeah I mean people are already talking about how hard it is why Carolyn has this report focused exclusively on the differences between one and a half Celsius and to Celsius in other words this is the difference between about three degrees Fahrenheit versus three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nBecause those are the two numbers that are written into the twenty Fifteen un climate change agreement so for a long time two degrees Celsius was sort of thought of as this kind of goal\nBut in Paris at the un conference in twenty Fifteen low lying island nations and really vulnerable countries like the Marshall Islands in Bangladesh banded together to push for this more ambitious target to be written into this global document so they got it in their\nBangladeshi climate advisor or sell the mural hock with one of the people working behind the scenes to get that more and dishes target written into that taxed\nAt that time it was more of a moral argument that we won't get disabled people on the planet and love just some people on the planet but what we have no is a very very sort of scientific assessment of how much damage seemed to me he's going to be to the whole world is just for people on the planet\nYou okay so what would two degrees Celsius due to the whole world\nThis report spells out some really significant differences even though one point five and two degrees don't sound like that far apart for example\nGame it was more of a moral argument that we wanted to save all the people on the planet and not just some people on the planet but what we have no is a very very sort of scientific assessment of how much

differences even though one point five and two degrees don't sound like that far apart\nFor example um ten and a half million more people would be impacted by sea level rise under two degrees and hundreds of millions more people would frequently face extreme heat waves a natural habitats would shrink for a lot more animals\nAnd coral reefs would be all but destroyed whereas under one point five degrees of warming some would still be around\nYou and twenty fifty is just around the corner so this is this is really sobering news um and like so much of what we hear about climate change

government supports basic scientific research by giving grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work professors love that story because it involves the government giving money to professor so you know they're they're keen on that but\nThe truth is that most discovery and most learning comes from the work on specific problems and the academics often come along later and kind of clean up afterwards\nLike when people started working out how to use steam engines to do work it was much later that physicists came along and then then thermodynamics to figure out you know what the heck are these guys doing so it wasn't like thermodynamics led to the invention steam engines steam engines\nThey're they're keen on that but\nTruth is that most discovery
