NPR Marist Poll signed the Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats it's great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this has energized them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and I'm this is the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if a cabinet gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks I'm watching\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judge has passed to have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived just had been pre filled by the presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I we're by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should lie in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent of his drinking\nIt is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally\nWhich is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why as your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should lie in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black and yeah I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the black neon phrase means doing things that you don't know you you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one oh\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nI don't think they did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam so I
