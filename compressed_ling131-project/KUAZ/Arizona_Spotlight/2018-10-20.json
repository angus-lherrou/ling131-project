position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize as a people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a

has gotten more and more concerned about deaths of citizens particularly unarmed citizens during police encounters in a few minutes we're going to hear from a Texas lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office today to uh Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ...

California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times Mr Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed him and I think of the classics\nRace was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed him and I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he has been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds and so those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is do you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that\nYou you noted though that he has been described a six foot three and three hundred pounds and sort of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone you wouldn't you described those things\nYou might not have sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is do you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nTo to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well absolutely\nAnd I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly\nThe target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection out so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly the mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the

cats do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nPhilando steel he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to find a baby or expectations of citizens and police officers at what's lost here is that people taking the legislation just focus on citizens well it doesn't it doesn't just focus on our video a video camera sets the stage\nHe's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least
