broadcasting today from WHYY in Philadelphia\nWe are of course following the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh today\nWe will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia\nYou may have hurt other colleagues from NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now\nVisiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of the blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan Wisconsin the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and uh all of those states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house so we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what's and they're on what's on their minds this election year to help us understand what we've been hearing we ask WHYY is Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and thanks to all this\nGoing to come back here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house because we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what's on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we asked WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is strange have you all so nationally Dave Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and Alice say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state me and for the last six years Pennsylvania ... have had congressional maps\nThat were pretty bizarrely shaped and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenge last year and a lawsuit there was aimed not in federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the states\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state me and for the last six years Pennsylvania ... have had congressional maps\nThat were pretty bizarrely shaped and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not in federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map a a an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they big theme is playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name\nCongressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money\nIt's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but was also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars up his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary or not\nAnd it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but what's also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars up his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary are\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations and away from the Ninety nine percent but just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid and the atmosphere this influence coming from the White House it's destructive of the fabric\nOf our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law on the FBI on our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and\nAll very negative [laughter]\nWorld corps in America and destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI on our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself is under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinge upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of here\nThe ... on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue\nThat ties all of this together is money in politics my opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money in this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control\nDollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money in this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending\nWhen you want gun control the ... amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests\nStops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district and the expense of media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that tells the candidate boats\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't\nNobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached and so that tells the candidate boats\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voices going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in\nYour campaign is he's huge\nI mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone still he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a\nWay I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in part a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming that and largely through his own urging he\nAround the country singer vote for blank is a vote for\nAnd they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone so he's not on the ballot\nBut is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in uh in part a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging he goes around the country singer vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election\nAnd of course interest is much higher and a presidential election and the reality is this is the first chance that voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing\nAnd the last thing I think anybody wants to see is drunk doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see Davis let me ask you about both of the things have got lost just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that\nWell Scott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help it's Patrick does he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative and most of it\nAround the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things that's got lost just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that well\nScott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has going into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help fitzpatrick because he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative\nAnd most of it and what about the Trump factor we talk about that is is is that the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about the might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump\nOr the feeling that that Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to stop I think it really is what's it's the most motivating thing I see\nSo as we said Democrats got while it is challenging the incumbent Republican Brian fits Patrick fitzpatrick is a former FBI agent the only form an FBI agent currently serving in the house but he's also been a vocal critic of President Trump on certain issues\nSuch as the way the president has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand sixteen elections and accomplish much\nTrump or the feeling that the Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to stop I think it really is what's it's the most motivating thing I see\nSo as we said Democrat Scott Wallace is challenging the incumbent Republican Brian Fitzpatrick fitzpatrick is the former FBI agent the only form an FBI agent currently serving in the house but he's also been a vocal critic of President Trump on certain issues such as the way the president has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand sixteen elections\nAccomplish much Patrick invited us to meet him at his parent's house in a suburb of Lebanon town where he grew up as the youngest of eight siblings and despite being the beneficiary of a lot of this so called independent expenditures the Davis just talked about flowing into the race and his behalf it's Patrick said that he agrees with his Democratic opponent that there's too much money in politics", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Arizona Spotlight", "city": "Tucson", "day":
