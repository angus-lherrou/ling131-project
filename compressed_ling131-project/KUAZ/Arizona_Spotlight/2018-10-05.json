one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to the confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that or an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare this would be the culmination for Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime\nReally of campaigning for a change to federal judiciary and let's just this little listen to a little bit more as they

and I do is you see that's right or you can't have a sperm sense of how the final vote goes until they band together\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a knife edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told

when we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin\nThat's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats\nVance this key procedural

cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us this vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await

although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex Conan has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nHey Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell looks like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the mid term midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base\nThat frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking\nThrough we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\n[noise] well it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nYou know continue to give Republicans some

to get them to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm\nThere'd been a doozy has them gap as a lot of the service has shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh on to have a when I think is just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters\nAs ... and that was a challenge for us going into the ... it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are gonna be more amped up than the people that are kind of fat and happy but\nNow we're uh months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters ... and that was the

of this vote are Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominees through because there was probably almost certainly be after the election\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that

there were probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWell I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee\nFrom a Republican perspective we wanted we wanted a ... a a another plenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nIf we wanted we wanted a ... a a another
