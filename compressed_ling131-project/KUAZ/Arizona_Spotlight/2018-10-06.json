partisan\nAnd divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you have a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators

and also I can spend more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for cycling full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollars\nAfter November first\nI feel very excited about it very happy because of their provider I now I can give to my family are better quality and also I spend more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for short going full time job\nGoing to change my life so we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with ... you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nSo there have been a few reports in a number of ...\nAnd and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour most of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho do want to raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports in a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for these stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were before\nSo I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase in the other changes to compensate\nFriend the company says pretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you\nWere before so I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase and the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming any idea why why why do they now so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that this conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a spate of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that

really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number the median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for family of four\nNow that is a worldwide number is what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company it is run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been put in quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something",
