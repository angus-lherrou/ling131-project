Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port city\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida waster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg I'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble some it already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normal\nHighway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of

hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nIt's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now and just a single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple electrical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the

Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in Appalachia go no power no ... very limited cell service and no outside help you\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest waster industry they've got fishing going on there are a lot of fishing and ... they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... along the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area high the whole they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most votes escaped major damage

the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nI'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nHis pastor around a small church in is mere and western turkey for years and years but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blames for that to it and\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incident\nDid the enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for that coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judges basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get grants and really\nI mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey and of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump's thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's districts that it was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation and they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering\nIs how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to

reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he\nWas about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free\nUm to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos have gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why our ships getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machine Scott uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos has gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nThe crime to our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nHow naive to think that's all that's in a bag of free to Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a processed food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch\nA much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that
