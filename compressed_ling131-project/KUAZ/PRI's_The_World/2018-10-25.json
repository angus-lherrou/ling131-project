gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites and all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars\nYou're right and

they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere but the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids\nThe thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coaches say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back into business\nTheir job get me kids the thinking in the industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is

hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\n[noise] but then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players\nThere and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there was another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\nAll right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you manage to have for in some way or another and get an NBA\nFrom these runners or go betweens on the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you

this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I was a family of a future NBA players\nOne of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or with a family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded their specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to private schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they\nWill find you designer for your new house and an interior designer so sports is a very insular business and a lot of the players want to deal with

federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nSports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their team first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all but\nPlayers generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not real students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their team first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you were you were having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nA while to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that the ... things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it is a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nDo think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be just in the way that people\nWhat your therefore when it come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations is a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nDo think it will make some difference but I think the difference will be\nJust in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful\nSunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the

grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive\nFor it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we cover this I mean you said that in some respects she went apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in\nThese charges the apparel companies have been very quiet they have put out sort of analysis statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet there is a Adidas executive who is one\nCase people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we cover this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in\nThese charges the apparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who this data's executive his father was a high school coach\nHe's an insider he's a basketball insider almost all of these defendants are well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you
