Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be excused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak who was such a mess and all of our Rio and on\nProbably had no idea that he would be excused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter] so let's just

you know we'll get bow jak who is such a mess and all of sorry oh and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by putting Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of the family sitcom\nUh that's terrible but it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and haven't beat the washed up star of the family sitcom\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and it's bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some fun surprising ways\nI liked that sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] on where you know as a kind of sadness I like the final version better [laughter]\nAnd and Jack is in such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's a little lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a

all but I never thought the orphans we're sad I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they want it they had something to lung for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got herself cleaned up and she was being Olivia's life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup

not really because\nIf everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is\nAssay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's coughing you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that

indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents any way they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that well you know I\nI think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but is gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nAnd I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your

better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurt so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement\nWith me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption and I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement were sent so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter] I'm One of the funny things that you've come up with\nFor the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole award ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the way\nFor sure but we forgive you rewards as presented on the show are awards\nThat celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented or a ... we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgiving recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it\nBut we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgiving recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things\nAnd they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening\nSecond maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just

Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks his homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her his use of of racial slurs\nIn Mr ... me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable that it still feels like we are not you know literally C. K. A. a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks\nI think that there is work that those men can be doing\nPartner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know Louis CK a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is work that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ...

bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell me about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the um bay area or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nOr extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um she would always bring home stuff from the store often it was defective stuff\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of ... that were shipped 'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end\nTo the misfit toys or Hanukkah um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of

have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own ...\nAnd that's been very scary to me um but also scary how little I recognize it or was

didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nI Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey set up because there's people that live at and like I think yeah\nAnd I and I would say a couple of years ago to be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to

wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't ...\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants don't fit inappropriate and and I remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here watching the boundaries I did\nIt was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't ...\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here watching the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take 'em you\nKnow or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I thought I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [noise] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least um\nJust say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas\nAnd it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like that\nAm I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space where you where you can like\nYourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nWell TV made sense to me and you know there was a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nTo have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward

that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it's a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for it by putting into the story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running bow jak which has Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you\nAnd I you know oh wouldn't that be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting another story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\nYou know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running bow jak witches Netflix series now that Comedy Central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you and ... like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know obviously want them to keep their\nDignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the show Netflix will embrace it\nKeep their dignity as an episode of television not edited out
