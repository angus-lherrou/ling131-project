date she started with a question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how he stands personality changed when he was using that\nHe he became unrecognizable or he went from being\nYou know just one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became\nThis coast a sort of coming in and out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost he was skin and bonds and he was\nThe ordinary people that I knew and he became\nYou know this coast a sort of coming in and out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost he was skinny bones and he was\nI think one of the things that you both had trouble with\n[noise] I I think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was the quote God talk you know in the ... anonymous model\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how ... year you were or are still are an an atheist and raised in it without religion um did\nEye to eye to felt guilty you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for\nThat too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is to embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be with us\nWe're are still are in an atheist and raise near without religion um did\nYou know I too I too felt guilty you know you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for\nThat too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was a ... would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know\nNick didn't agree for a long time of his ... that that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think it is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lotta timing trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nControl he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lot of time and they're trying so hard\nTo practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe and ultimately you know when I sit with myself in the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you know don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nBut the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get health again sober and to stop using the first thing that Nick told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of a rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic\nAbsolutely that's a trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there isn't just one way to get healthy and sober and to stop using the first thing that Nick told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWas he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said well wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that that I mean you know that's what he says that that that those three months were essential\nTo did that program that you not rely on the higher power principle\nDidn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and now as a part of that but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and it's where every experience some of the traumas that I experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them and\nRely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was a part of it but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and re experience some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and grieve them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all I mean I I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power\nI learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is a it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone\nBefore this was over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in prayer it is\nJust seeing anybody mhm that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power\n[noise] I I learned to define it in in a way that works for me which is a it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to Al Anon meetings I was told by someone before this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray I'm going to do what they told me but all of a sudden they were part moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get\nThrough ... what is pretty mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was a it was a ... it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to pray I was saying please please please save neck please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way way just to stay sane and to stay focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um\nBut it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over a drought\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay sane and its effect focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um that part of what saved you from your math addiction was a degree of self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think was the rehab and what you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I I mean that's the you know it's a ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's you know it's so subtle I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily you know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself\nA diagnosis ... yes I I mean that's you know it's a ... I think it's like\nVery very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's you know it's so subtle I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily\nYou know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome absolutely\nA Nick tells the story in his book but to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see\nUs I'm Carrying my my wife and Jasper and daisy or we were in this we hadn't seen that for a long time in in ... and said you know let's let's invite neck to join us we were going on the family vacations and that came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what had been going on and it was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that's I think it was just so meaningful to them into carrying and to me and we had a really good time and then\nHe describes the day before he was leaving he got just really\nWe hadn't seen for a

leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks but um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other ways but\nWhatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes nickel just\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from

opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of like it and I took one I thought to myself just one\nWhich is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week\nSo he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the handled and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was

possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the

behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress ... one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so you know when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think the treatment can't work\nA Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been ... step program is probably going to you know a ... step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah\nGreat great progress and since then he's been sober so ah it shows that it's possible I mean people think the treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a twelve step program\nYou've probably gone to you know a a twelve step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah and then you visited them just as research for the book so you see you see you know positives and negatives with the twelve step program\nSo I think most people know what the positive\nUh parts are but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nSteps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it was forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embraced the twelve steps\nBut not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the key to the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embraced the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternatives\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings and what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people telling me\nOver and over and over again go to Ellen on new things got Al Anon meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and saying I'm not going into one of those rooms where people are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt\nYou know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support\nWe're addicts I I was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people told me over and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings got Allentown meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and thing I'm not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on his face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as in I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the day's\nLesson on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK ... if it's not prying into
