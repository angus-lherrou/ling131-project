that have to change this is about institutional accountability [noise]\nSuch in about the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism\nIt's not hard problem it's your problem ... and there are signs will say things like\nDon't get raped and then they'll cross out some of the word so let's go rape no it's boys who have to change its the into tuitions that have to change this is about institutional accountability [noise]\nThat's about the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism and I'll use beyond say as an example here I mean she is a symbol of empowerment to so many women in so many men and women just\nI mean a door her understandably\nAt the same time in so many of her concerts over the years she's she's dressed in very sexual allies clothing and a lot of the clothing it's in this is to have a lot of women like pop stars and he'll pop stars [noise]\nUm it's it's very sexual lives in kind of designed to call attention to the most sexual areas of the body [noise] um so you know you could see it one way like it's a sign of my sexual empowerment or you could see it another way I'm offering myself to you as an object\nAs a sexual I as somebody\nSexual allies clothing and a lot of the clothing it's and it's just to have a lot of women like pop stars and he'll pop stars [noise] um it's it's very sexual lives in kind of designed

your gaze on the most sexual parts of my body\nMhm and and again you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nIt's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is empowering or is this denigrating 'em\nAnd you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nIt's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with

isn't that just somewhere justifying on this kind of way that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I\nTruly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up you know these kids that I interviewed in college just graduating now\nYou know Brittany spears was just like they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without
