process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we do need to do this or a big powerful company um\nAnd I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president\nWe don't need to do this or a big powerful company um\nAnd who I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president\nNow Facebook has done a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors you know give us an example [noise] this

Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth and vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong that our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message

internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decrease sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they are trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is Annette ... and the company has been done to acknowledge it you heard for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively if you're just sitting there scrolling with glazed eyes hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you and so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it\nPeople feel lonely there is a lot

hour we recognize this is not good for you and so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively\nCommunicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key difference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that any more you\nTalk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that is he regard this kind of experimentation\nHe absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I

often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do is he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in an intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a a ticket to get out into the world I'm\nVery often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing and that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers\nUh to to get out into the world I'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing and that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond its comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had\nA civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary member of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being bold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm\n[noise] he did and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel the same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did a and people so that's that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of it\nAnd that they were being bold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a

and people said that's that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states and it's really embedded in the bill of rights and um his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people further\nThere was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be\nAggressively transparent in order 'em to be modern this the sense was as one person to put it um you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion\nRadical transparency the idea that you had to be\nAggressively transparent in order 'em to be

would be this fusion the union of our private cells in our public solves\nBut that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed\nThat being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and their their ... their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world now almost like redefining what it is to be human [laughter] [noise]\nYeah they believed that this\nThat this

this case the hackers were able to get total control of\nThe accounts so are there they were able to get control of your privacy settings that could go into your messages they could post things on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers\nDoing that so that only heightens the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who studied the history of Facebook\nIs it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they would have they would have\nProbably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um\nUh so that only heightens the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals' if

understand that that simply not the case they initially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation and and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation and what's remarkable about that is is how\nEfficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin had fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project\nAnd yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and\nActually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian

had fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project\nAnd yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that fundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had this dispositive effect\nOn our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged that from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's right um so the company was in big trouble ... went before Congress\nAct on what you're telling them and yet at the same

Congress and and it was growing calls for regulation and\n[noise] he\nSome ways is vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally
