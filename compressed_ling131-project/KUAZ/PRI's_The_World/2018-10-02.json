positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this an article published in Vanity Fair Greg

Greg Miller welcome to fresh air is your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration ...\nMean there there are several um stories of obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for him for many people as the story or that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others\nHonest about his conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached it a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was was was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations with foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister\nThe foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister\nSo Wilbur Ross ... did you were you surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do about data and I don't want to sound a just here\nBut I'm data and how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what that means anymore\nWe know he was falling asleep in meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know the people who try to explain to him how the department work came away and these were Republicans who who were brought him to try to explain how the department work to have\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything betrayed so even if he wasn't he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission\nSo rapidly and I have no idea if he's kept up with what that means anymore\nWell we know he was falling asleep in meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who tried to explain to him how the department work came away and these were Republicans who who are brought in to try to explain how the department worked to him\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything betrayed so even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission to the department and added to that\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the Forbes rich list to calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the fore rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to think a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice he's very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President

agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among others so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexy\nThe Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action

on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not really surprised because ... ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abuse and scorn and it's collected rust and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know he's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is the ... a lot of the risk that the government manages are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them\nIn decades of abuse and scorn and it's collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much ... nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect to the fifth risk is the ... a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public has gone along with it and that's that's that's the frightening thing to me\nYou see a lot of action happening at the department let a lot that kind of level of government where things are being done ... position\nTop of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done were positions aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the fifth risk the Commerce Department includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did during the Commerce Department\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Congress\nLet's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the fifth we ask the Commerce Department includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli\nNoah first of all what did you sign on the Commerce Department [laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department are and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place\nNick Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department are and it does it eats most of the resources and ... and what it does\nUm is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay well\nI'm so here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nTypically the person who runs no uh as as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them an image and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property\nOr that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it\nIt has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to essentially forbid\nLives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to essentially forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a of a weather event that might kill you\nAnd the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs that the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this\nBy the taxpayer I mean that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh adopt the radar that network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spent the bulk of its money accumulating the data that it makes it available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the ... risk we'll talk more after a break and Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd we love more fresh air coming up and just a moment on NPR eighty nine point one does evening at seven jazz happening now is here with those jet family\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd we'll have more fresh air coming up and just a moment on NPR eighty nine point one this evening at seven jazz happening now is here with those jet family the weekly preview of new jazz CD releases\nAnd the people who were running the part of energy had the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say one of I think he\nAnd listened politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were\nRunning the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the court landing team we send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the question\nWanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpreted as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuel\nBy people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving them the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts\nThe department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to engage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of quantified in a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know in the Trump Administration are getting on ... because there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\nThat do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing pocket because in some ways\nDepartments and you know in the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those department\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk is that when you changed the ... people don't sets it\nEspecially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in\nAnd approach the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking at the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic\nPeople don't sense it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the you know one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in hand for Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know wanting to million are wondering how hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I ... the society doesn't feel it it kind of interesting shows you that people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place [noise]\nAnd I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel ... column and diversity showed you the people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability in\nAnd and world markets [noise] well I'm a big question\nWhat is it a question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nInterpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis which you've done I'm I'm doing what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and\nAnd world markets [noise] well I'm a big question [laughter]\nWhat is the question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk\nThat he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say oh the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole all that money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back this is a a war way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk I like the ...\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalized and better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so\nWhy would I think you could say national as well\nBecause the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds of the benchmark for a ... of ...\nStill emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that

measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding or predict things where where ...\nWhen they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that\nPlaying with it here
