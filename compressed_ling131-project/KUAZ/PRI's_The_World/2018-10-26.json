Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace\nAnd you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars are acting out as a gay person you know we're elements

him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time\nWell yeah that's true and that there are people I mean this was a really\nI mean it it's a very it's an issue very much of the most interesting because I've gone to con around the block\nSee anything he was on like fluid in his ... yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter and [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends with gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element

it you saw what you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of open to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then well that's right they didn't that language didn't exist if I did one guy I just wanted to\nSay one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI only have zero price on Iran or I ... yeah\nKnow and and ah I once said you know his first wife was talking

these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took a loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever given their money and she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son is Jewish family and you know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that\nHe couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand would ever lose needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his

Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own he didn't have any money not eat set so he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes explain how transgression of is that [laughter] I'm not totally\nDon't have any I always see would say goes you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time in making money and if they were there the ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City um that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island\nI'm not totally they don't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to buy time in making money and if they were there the ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship that was a\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad um and you know he certainly would characterize them in song\nYou know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period they team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his\nHe always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad um and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you you know got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of yeah to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for ... lead\nLet's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know just going to make some movies now and you know and says like we should have a bad you know rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground or you know through some you know and you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Morsi has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\n... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know just going to make some movies now and you know it says like we should have a bad you know rock and roll is getting to be a thing and so they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know on you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer you lose not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico was participation as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he kick Nicola the band as well after having an affair with her and well that's very true\nThe that was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico was participation as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he kick Nico the band as well after having an affair\nAnd well that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time were who was in the newspapers all the time they're not\n... you know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day it was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd uh you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was pretty Ernest thing and the I wore whole seemed like a put on like uh\nAlthough that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day it was in the

thing and the I wore whole seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who hadn't heard them yet you know unheard of amazing they are so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know this needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way Andy Warhol was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nGuess

forth by you know his desire you don't look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there could be a rock band to have credibility and not have hit before that\nSo that so that was actually hit friendly we got from your book like this attack he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was

you\nKnow [laughter] more than more going to get out of that yeah yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits [laughter] you know you got a year or two and then you went home but um you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so\nThe degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do pick another walk on the wall side or walk on the wall side again and you know that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified uh\nHey ah but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now

depressing record 'em\nSo you know he would turn on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once he had destroyed his standing you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record it I'm a big success at a big seller was alive album and a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know
