million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct

was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen he was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in his early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to

adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to get his father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own

he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments it\nAlso see that when his so you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nIn the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his company has their either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn and according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment and

number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case

Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was not a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and you will and it was caught a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in the lawyer and a new caught us all\nCentrally and new will and it was caught a soldier the will is taken

executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial

received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his dad\nAnd David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published a long investigative article this month but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump measured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... di Donna Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why to Donald Trump make that decision [noise] so\nInteresting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it on I think well we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a chalk and then in two thousand and\nThrough his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meetings after fried Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell and quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSince ... the the uh buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death I'll toss include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through that\nThose buildings ... own at that time of his death I'll get it also includes all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much his old empire and it's sold them you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to New York developer named ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down and Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion skiing how did they get all of this past the IRS\nBut um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that downtown ... it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\nBut um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on\nThe lower valuations they're placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if him for a million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who hire the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid\n... is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who hire the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at gift in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his

getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly when the moment when he was just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into
