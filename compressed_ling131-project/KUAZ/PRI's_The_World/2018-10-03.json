guest timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind yeah\nYou mean blaming myself yeah you like the ... and Katherine my ... and ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a demented thing to do but then I started to understand what she said I remember my producer\nOn line yeah you mean blaming myself yeah anyway you like the ... and Katherine my ... and ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I sort of understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why\nShe feels betrayed by some notion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori is time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life now\nSo I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she is you really can't be blamed\nBut I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of women\nWhen you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nAway from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about and\nNever seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really you know that marriage and\nHaving babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was a performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that to go to

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was\nTo correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and\nI and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but [noise] and maybe the idea of having a mom that it was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking is Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambling he was really like a character so you made three feature films two of them are about\nBeing a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there and it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages\nParents or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there and\nIt was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home and he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing\nUm in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type\n'em right and there isn't a strange men need between you know between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIn a strange men\nNeed between you between the character and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one and wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has made you so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot\nIt must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there is actually for children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with their father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ...
