pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to ask in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American

Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means uh interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or a texture list I say that not really understanding the difference between those two terms but\nLeah who was replaced by Gorsuch or wasn't originalist which means are interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or attacks journalist I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is Gorsuch or having a an originalist or ... or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they would both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing\nAbout the whole original is a a a a trope is that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot there is no clause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me too\nEven original is only use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a a trope\nIs that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot there is no clause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nWas something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights\nYou say that originalism favors a status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection\nA status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents were senators I'm to use their own\nJudgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution [noise] do you think that\nJustice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because of the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical a process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates\nThat's why you write a constitution [noise] do you think that\nJustice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because of the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen to go some of their stellar credentials those were unnecessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was chosen by Bill Clinton and it's so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved so often it raises the stakes\nOf who sits on the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that\nIt was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved so often it raises the stakes\nOf who sits on the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues\nThan you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees include how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAnd and listen if the Democrats get control of Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together\nThose days do you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees but includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together and they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court pack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house and the Senate or the White House\nIn twenty Twenty one I don't think\nCourt packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals than an eleven member court ever six five majority do I think that's possible yes\nBeing a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave\nTwenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back the Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals that an eleven member court you have a six four majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave\nHow old is your third or Ginsburg now\nEighty five and how old was a John Paul Stevens when he left Ninety yeah so I mean you can say for a really long time [noise] um\nSo a lot of people already ... it's a pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written 'em in the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was ... ...\nSo the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written\n'em in the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was big cuts in part of the extension
