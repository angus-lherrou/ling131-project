some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used a full scale replicas of these capsules they were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were exactly the same our production designer on anything Crowley did incredible job sort of rebuilding these things\nAnd we would we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to\nAh and we would set those up against a ...

I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times\nSo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point

hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't then\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a like the spin sequence we were talking about you know certain\nYou know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space\nIn juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of beam me up Scotty space this is a this is ... machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nAre little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from him\nIt's a little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis was a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight NASA puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't just in case they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um did did that actually happen\nYeah I mean you can find the uh you know you can search it

given\nBut in a way to capture late in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know

this is music he plays on the way to the moon ah things would you refer yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay so it's\nIt's a less Baxter piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of a genre that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this

with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me is so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nKnow I was a ... you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm a it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on humans mentioned in Japan since book Neal like this\nIt just strikes me as sell it just so strange I I as somebody any I Know how interested you are in music and how you play music so how did it strike you\nKnow I was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book\nThat Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and some of the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a ... or listen to two together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who is a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play this track that really no one listening no\nYou are with something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in

um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate

that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of

[noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and uh through a lot of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during or after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and uh oh by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals so yeah I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and it was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joy and the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing um space capsules in space flight and creating like\nRhetoric is unreal ... miniatures it's it's it's\nThis project had been kind of simmering in the background

it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicas unreal size and miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know la la land was a complex film but that's like the choreography and the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nI mean I uh I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the the the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat uh uh and and and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were a going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were gonna see their mom and their dad or

see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself in all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nYou mentioned al thank you so much for attacking us
