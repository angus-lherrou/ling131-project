to sign non disclosure agreements\nWhich means that they wouldn't be able to divulge\nAnything to a reporter like you and if you called them and this is an attempt to prevent any kind of damaging information about the Trump Administration from from getting out to the public do you know when somebody you're speaking to has signed a non disclosure agreement\nI Can't say I've ever encountered I'm somebody who has signed such a room and I know that they exist in the White House I Know that they've I'm drawn to offer financial inducement 'em to those will be willing to sign them as they as they leave\nThe administration and move on 'em or morose it comes to mind um\nNo I just think that's such a bizarre approach these are these are supposedly public officials they are they are are public servants they are not President Trump's public\nI'm drawn to offer financial inducement 'em to those will be willing to sign them as they as they leave the administration and move on I'm On a roast that comes to mind um\nNo I I I just think that's such a bizarre approach these are these are supposedly public officials they are they are are public servants they're not President Trump's public servants um the idea that anybody would be required to sign\nAny kind of loyalty oath to him personally I'm is just goes against the grain of so many ah principles that it's hard to fathom\nPeople who want to just credit reports about the Trump Administration that report said expose I'm either you know lies false heads misdeeds say all those stories relying anonymous sources I'm not going to like trust I'm not going to trust and not on an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your own rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post\nTrump Administration that report said expose I'm either you know lives false hoods misdeeds say all those stories relying anonymous sources I'm not going to like trust I'm not going to trust and not run an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can\nBe confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really an a really important one at this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about this art but it's not like you know ended up leaving yelling you the information\nThat's up see right through sources are not anonymous to us um these are sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want one really saying on them as source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up calling you the information\nThat's absolutely right the sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story in how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that\nAnd how we ended up having nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well what does the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story\nUm who are we talking about here and you can you can basically describe their positions in government\nSometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know more they're going to want to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with source they are a source be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms of our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be\nSometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be but it's something you know

and and then and we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care

Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation but\nTrump has also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\n... is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody's head on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke

a little time in jail they make a new friend suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell let me let me ... ... ...\nIt made me afraid I ...
