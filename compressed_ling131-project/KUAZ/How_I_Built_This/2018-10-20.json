again another document this notebook of his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance dividing Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see we're really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories\nUm this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak with Mary Sue militant and Susan vinegar about their

the kind of the the kernel of of their their own history [noise]\nUm so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in border grill they had gone through their
