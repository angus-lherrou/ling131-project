listened to you so much and so so often that a year like my brother you've been you've been here at home\nWith us and Ecuador [laughter] thank you I Hope to actually come back we're one day credibly beautiful but ah what do we talk about\nWell here's the problem by uh we live in a very hot place where do we get a real like ... or like eighty five degrees and that's what we put on a sweater\nOr it it is very hot and very humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt not not so much because soul mates preservation but just to keep it dry\nAnd a ... and so we we really are are very careful with ah we don't have a store things\nAnd one day we were having um a party and a friend came a friend had just come from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of prosciutto is just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it ... around him\nSo we don't have a store things and one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend had just come from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of prosciutto it's just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it ... around him and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk and so in the midst of the party at my wife says why should we cut the what we dress had no just just put it in the freezer for now and she put it in the freezer\nAnd it's been there and ah anyway\nWe have no idea what to do once we ... because we cannot possibly three pounds or ... before it would spoil and I am totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing I Would be speaking to my wife pulled it out of the uh the ... is currently defrosting\n[laughter] oh wow okay there's no turning back [laughter] yeah there isn't it [laughter]\nYou know you've got the guardian not on the front of you know I see this is an interesting problem I Am honored that you would drive me with it I Hope and\nThree pounds or ... before which spoiled and I totally committed\nTo your chair suggestions because this morning knowing you're speaking to my ... pulled a free ... is currently defrosting\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back yeah there isn't it [laughter]\nYou've you've cut the guardian not on the frozen per se you know I see this\nIs an interesting problem I Am honored that you would trust me with it I Hope I don't feel you have to say I've never actually had to deal too much with a giant frozen block appreciate them before that's\nA lot to me in a can of ... in some ways a a blessing problem now have to tell you given the fact that it was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to defrost meaning if you have questions to\nIf you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in an industrial freezer that didn't work because it freezes it so quickly that the ice crystals um stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're then they're\nIn a home freezer because it takes a while but ice crystals start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell walls and so you may find that leak some juice\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it\nIf you have questions\nYeah if you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in a unit industrial freezer that can work because it freezes it so quickly that the ice crystals um stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're they're there\nAnd the home freezer because it takes a while the ice crystals start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell walls and so you may find that elite some juice\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be quite as um for more you know sort of to some as it was before or maybe not as delicate\nThat said if it's not totally be frosted what I might think about doing is\nIf you have a a deli or if you have a deadly slice yourself if you know a deli nearby may consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen\nSo your little slice of thin\nKnow package it however many slices you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage that said the other thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally a fresh\nOver there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen so your little slice and thin you know package it however many slices you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage\nThat said the other thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally a fresh per se um but so I think about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask dessert cooking solution because I I thought the same thing that it would probably watch was deposed it even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be just said\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe a wrapping it around his piece of chicken you wrapping around something and then you can sort of cigarettes you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a salty cured ham if you're if you're not in a position to be able to enjoy it and that sort of like silky thin sliced uh\nYou can sort of cigarettes you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise] um [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a salty cure ham if you're if you're not in a position to be able to enjoy it and it sort of like\nSilky thin sliced a state\n[noise] no I assumed that since sliced phase of it slices over it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder if even if we\nEven thought maybe it was just putting the whole thing and the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole time and she would\nYou know I have never done that but I\nIs that thing right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey\nTry and I'm sure someone in Italy with like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this to us you know but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure the texture may not have all the flavor of all the beautiful cures labor is going to be there so if you do that in a slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious um it'll be quite salty so\nFreedoms another word for nothing left to lose [laughter] so hey try it and I'm sure someone in Italy with like you know role in their grave when they heard someone done this to a procedure but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure\nThe texture may not have all the flavor of all the beautiful cure flavor is going to be there so if you do that in a slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly\nRich delicious um it'll be quite salty so of course you you want to think about that one eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish I'm set of cooking the whole thing but Henri ... you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hams that they do exactly that with\nIts cured it aired dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it indeed thin you took the whole ham and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out and you might save some of that\nLiquid 'em to used to I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze that and use that as a stock or as a a a flavor base for other stocks and then eat the meat\nYou know I think I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it you know as a flavoring for vegetable dish maybe\nThen you took the whole ham and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt come out you might see some of that liquid 'em to use a I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze not use that as a ... a labor base rather stocks and then eat the meat\n[noise] you know I think I I liked a lot of the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it or you know it's a flavor and has served for vegetable dishes and maybe\nSauces and things like that I I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a dish called ... and one of the things it's like a big giant stew and one of the things we should do is put a big piece of a pork belly you know not like not like sliced bake it a big square of it into the ...\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish through the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it but\n[laughter] um so I kind of like that idea of mine yeah different things you're cutting it in half\nAnd using some of it for chunks for added to the vegetables and stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens\nYeah yeah well if you kind of nice enough nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render that maybe you can add up\nAnd as a kid I Would always fish through the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so it kind of like that idea of like different names you're cutting\nIt in half and using some of it for chunks for added to the vegetable stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens\nYeah yeah yeah what kind of nice enough nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render its fat maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other fats in the pan when they get a little bit nice and brown scrambled eggs in that and that would be\nSo delicious yeah I don't you know I Would like use the prosciutto with something that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean it's a beautiful flavor whenever you do with it thanks so much for listening all the way from ... new", "show_name": "How I
