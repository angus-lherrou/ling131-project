iron and enamel costs arm breeze or about what size\n[noise] um I Would say probably eight or twelve fourteen inches pretty large\nOh big like a a big yeah oh cool and then you\nHave some cats aren't coats which was like the basically the little mini brings it was right and how big are those are the kind of like someone said to her and I can\nOkay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm

because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more Neanderthal there so I um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread in there or like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or do for like a breakfast or brunch like you know exactly what you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake they're just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation ... um but\nYou're twelve or fourteen inch praise or not they were talking because that is a really fun be appointment\n[noise] I think for that I Want to talk to you about in general what I think that kind of pot does really well so what I think his beautiful about like a big\nHeat in the oven to sort of gently bake there's just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation ... um but you're twelve or fourteen inch brazen ... they were talking because that is a really fun ... appointment to have [noise]\nI think for that I Want to talk to you about in general I think that kind of pot does really well so what I think it's a beautiful about like a big cast iron enamel brazen when you say is\nA cast iron so it holds heat really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action in there which is certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that is that\nIt can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature and so what that means to me is\nIf your searing say you know short ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you want ... chicken and you want to see the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like heartier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but\nIt can actually hold he really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature and so what that means to me is\nIf your searing say you know short ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you want ... chicken and you want to see your the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like hardier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but over like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like ripping up the all the way high you know I mean\nAnd you know get the oil and there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel season them lay him and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a more intense or like a deeper seer is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan holds that heat so well\nAnd it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut it'll just really get that searing nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nAnd that's something I didn't really can get valid that ended up ... like I said it ... and stealing\nIn the pan holds that heat so well and it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut it'll just really get that seared nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really think that would that piece of equipment that I thought it was kind of stealing or breathing are no longer not smart fear more exciting\nYeah and what's really awesome then though is once you get that really nice dark seer\nThem what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't burnt so then you continue to use that to a Braves like you said this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever you using\nAnd it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on put an oven and I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off and just sort of a write in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt's almost like it's one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter]\nWeiner stock or you know whatever using and it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on put an oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out the oven and you can take the lid off just server right in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt's almost like it's one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cooked food I get to eat out of it\nToo [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect for both of us to kind of\nSurfing will enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to eat it All right let's now go there's no you make it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not because they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants to learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles turnout machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more out and say\nI'm I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think my first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do is cooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher heat\nIt's not 'cause they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants

zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do is cooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher he because what happens is when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still zucchini and zucchini eight cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen is you know the stuff on the surface of the pan is cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle isn't quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest is divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your pan ripping hot put in some nice oil maybe aromatic what if you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them quit tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can eat cooked\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your
