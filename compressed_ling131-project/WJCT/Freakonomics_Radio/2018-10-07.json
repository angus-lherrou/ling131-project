{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Now as to what happened to Rodney that night Ben has looked at\nTestimony from the cops involved from eyewitnesses different court records to piece together the events yeah Rodney including all these documents that night Rodney in a six year old cousin ... car they stopped at a gas station they let the gas station and we're driving down this a highway when\nHe and his little cousin or get pulled over by to a white officers\nThe officer said he saw him without a seatbelt turns out Rodney was wearing a seatbelt and these two officers approaches vehicle one is kind of standing in front of a car about several feet away towards like the driver's side an officer approaches his window according to run these cuts and says boy why didn't you pull over sooner\nAnd a and then orders Rodney to put the car in park and ride he's got both hands at this point on the steering wheel and he reaches down to put the current park\nAnd this is where things in the story started diverge because the cops say the Rodney but the ... part but then quickly put it back into Dr accelerated at the officer in front of the car run his cousin give two conflicting accounts as to what happened there was apparently and eyewitness across the street who said the car had yet to move\nBut what is clear is what happened next which is the deputy in front polls that his gun fires two shots into the windshield the W. right by the door\nHere's the fire he pulls a gun and fires twice\nOne ballooned to Romney's left hand which he put up in self defense another bullet entered through his left temple\nAnd the car largest forward and Koreans across the street\nFor about three hundred yards until the ... with this gas station Romney's cousin at this point gets out of the car fleet from the scene unharmed mentally paramedics arrive and pronounce Rodney dead at the scene\n\nMy mind is always Rodney\nWith us she says when she does things about that night she always comes back to this one question why were the gospel\nWhy what ... what was that all about what do you think the answer\nThere ever a moment where you try and put yourself in the mind of those two officers\nAbsolutely not because I Would never do somebody hit like that\nYou feel like it's like\nIt do you feel like the cop in a moment\nIt's run these black is what frightens a cop\nAnd that's why he pulled his gun oh\nNo he's a bully held if he if somebody gets hurt us the money gets injured or killed he's going to get off\nHe's behind that blue bad she's bully\nIs that what you think of cops like writ large that's how it is\nThat's exactly how it is not if in them buts about it\nBecause it's hard for me because I think like\nLike it's clear that there's discrimination would that exist within the police force and the people who they are sworn to protect and serve but like at the end of the day there's probably a hand like well I don't know I couldn't give you a percentage but a number of officers\nIn which like yes there are probably violent individuals who don't belong in a police force but I Would assume that like a majority of the cops mean well\nProbably probably have some sort of biased where they don't think I see a black person and I'm like\nI'm going to get that boy\nBut that there is like a like there's some sort of triggered response\nAnd in that the police\nAre constantly being put into different situations where they feel under threat\nAnd concerned\nAnd that like there's like a whole host of factors leading to these moments where somebody is shot and killed it's not just that they're out here bowling people as\nYou say that because you're you're white\nI tell you what we can try this\nGo to my sister will make sure we could each week go to Penn Islam it yourself spray black and I guarantee you get a different response\nI dare you try I bet you we can make you look I have a black boy I'm telling you\nLike sitting like sitting there\nI felt I felt the Gulf\nHow long does it take to fill that Gulf like how many ... what does it take a\nHow many conversations to happen\nAny case um do you want us to bend still had to keep in touch with those files on Rodney to get those documents fear\n... sure okay\nHe'll spend grab this huge folder of paper out of the trunk of our car\nUm send put the stack brownies files on this glass kitchen table so it goes to [noise]\nBecause I don't want to be the person\nTo give you this unless you want me to go get them right now but\nYeah when I'm ready to get\nSomething in the eventually see\nThree days later Natasha contact it then and said that she was ready to see those photos\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge thanks to Ben Montgomery the Tampa Bay times and to the staff\nOf that

J. reading and it was played in the NBA since two thousand six\nYou can never shoot basketball the way that I could but he could hit a baseball a mile had a cannon for an arm and my best friend from high school was the same way in a certain kids are just everything sort of comes easy to them and it's natural them\nI have seen some of the most physically gifted and talented gymnasts I think our sport has ever seen\nShawn Johnson again she now coaches young gymnasts\nBut they just do not have the capability to to get themselves that elite level and it's not a matter of training them or you know getting them to the right sports psychologist start getting the right people around them it's just it's not there so\nThank you have to be born with some sort of\nInnate ability to [laughter] you know ... all paying and emotion and push yourself past the boundary that Ninety nine percent of the world operates than\nI remember being in an apartment we lived in in Indianapolis Dominique\nFox worse again and I told my father I wanted to be a professional football player he was eight years old and he told me All right well you fed a goal you should do something to be closer to go every day\nAnd I took that to heart so I did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was I'm throwing up it's like ridiculous\nWhat was it the gay Fox worth such an intense drive for football\nI was in love with the game in part because of how violent it was honestly like whatever warped sense of masculinity I had at that age that probably has not fully left me with like basketball was for the soft kids football is for the men and I want to play football [noise]\nSo yeah most of the athletes we've heard from were extraordinarily driven\nAnd talented but of course they both work incredibly hard at protecting their craft\nMost of them at least remember Donald Thomas our high jumping friend\nDavid Epstein interviewed Thomas's college track coach and\nUsually find him like outside you know should be free throws when he was supposed to be inside learning how to high jump most athletes however do train incredibly hard in part because they're not allowed not to buy the coaches are teams maybe their parents but of course they also push themselves\nI think it's about how much you want it how much you love it and how much you're willing to sacrifice for\nMike McGuire NCI is a rookie offensive lineman on the San Francisco forty niners he was in ninth player chosen in this year's draft\nI was never the best athlete on my team I was I'm I'm Still not the best athlete on my on my\nTeam here um but I've always wanted it more I've always worked harder than everybody else and I'm I'm just attention to detail and the things that you need to know how to self correct you need to know how to learn\nKnowing how to learn is particularly valuable when the skills you're trying to learn our unusual\nPlayoff of divine as one of the more on natural human movements on earth in sport I think um you're required to move over large man out of the way and\nWhen you're trying to stop them and pass protection you're completely moving backwards so it's a really really different thing to have to learn how to do and are\nUntil your body can feel it until you can watch it on film and self diagnosed right when things happen on that's where the separation comes in\nThere's also the fact that the training opportunities in some sports are inherently constrained\nSki racing is a really unique sport in many ways to kill ... when you think about it the actual time that I stand or any race or spend on the hill actually skiing during the day of training let's say you get\nCourse length is about sixty seconds long and you get seven runs in one training session and that takes about\nSomewhere between three to five hours depending on how how long the terrorists they say you're adding up about seven minutes total of practice and your support for the entire training session which is comparative to say three to five hours of somebody playing tennis in a single session\nWhich makes me feel like the deliberate practice component is that much more central you know there's gears out their teammates of mine in the past to spend their time from the top of the chair left to the top of the race course it could be\nThe trail links that they're skiing down and they're just kind of like flailing about and doing whatever and I was like doing drills to the top of the course trying to make use of every square inch of space on the mountain every time I'm deliberately practicing skiing and my technique and everything then I'm kind of getting a one up on everybody else who's not\nBecause it's so demanding to master the skill set that accompany each sport whether it's skiing or swimming or football you can imagine an aspiring athlete would want to spend as much time as possible on that skill set and not waste time on say other sports\nThis has become a huge debate in youth sports at what age should an athlete stop playing other sports and commit to there's a lot of young athletes and especially their parents seem to think the best move is to pick your sport early and focus solely on that sport man it drives me nutty Kerry Welsh Jennings\nIt's just I think it's such a ... odd place to come from specialization in anything\nI'm let alone when you're a child and you're eight years old you do not need to pick your sport that you're going to maybe get a college scholarship for you know and play three sixty five twenty four seven which is mentally and spiritually and physically just it'll crush you\nSo I have a major problem with the way things are right now and I absolutely know that I and a great athlete because I did everything growing up and I wanted to be a great athlete\nYeah I was never that child that turned ten years old and said oh my gosh I Need to give up everything and everyone ingests commit my life to the Olympics\nThe gymnast Shawn Johnson\nI had to you know blue collar family all American Midwest just kind of parents that wanted me to be normal and they pushed me to be in so many sports and so many activities and\nUm try the oboe and clarinet and piano practice and mock trial and all these things that kind of distracted me from the ... dream it always gave me the perspective of I Love everything but I Love gymnastics more\nAnd so whenever I was ... I focused more than any other activity and gave more effort there because they knew that was my favorite\nThere is some research to back up these stories from Johnson and wolf Jennings\nSo for example after the last World Cup a group of German scientists\nUm published a study where they attract the development of soccer players in Germany that's David obscene and he's talking about the two thousand fourteen World Cup and found that the athletes who went on to the national team which by the way one that World Cup\nUm had played more different sports when they were younger spent more time in self structured or unstructured soccer play when they were younger but not more time in deliberately structured soccer training\nOnly by age twenty two did they start playing fewer sports in spending more time and structured soccer the athletes who put into the lower levels so this sort of less structured development\n[noise] um and turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become like [noise]\nOkay but\nWhat if you are young athlete or the parents of one and your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athletes\nBut rather to get into ... university like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise] you know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that Steve ... my freakonomics friends and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nBy my calculation about ... four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that offensive but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\n[noise] have a fencing the the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThree different blade says eBay there's Sabre list foil and there's mail this\nGiven that relatively few kids in the U. S. are serious you Spencers so it's something like\nHere we have um a league called the RBI league which is reviving baseball in the inner cities\nThat Kim and major league baseball senior vice president of international baseball development\nSo have we seen academies develop\nIn Kansas City in Philadelphia New Orleans or Washington DC at least academies are really providing opportunity for eight young kids and particularly of color to come and train with us\nFree of charge of course and it really honing their skills\nYou could argue that sports are among the most married a credit endeavors the humans do after all when you're measuring outcomes with ... yards\nBy whether the ball goes in the net or doesn't think that an athlete's background where they come from what they look like it wouldn't matter much but sometimes it does\nProfessional sports teams in particular\nOften have very conservative mines\nThey tend to go looking for players who look a lot like the previous players which means they might overlook someone ... we should not have been over [noise]\n\nIn two thousand twelve the New York Knicks went on a nine three winning streak sparked by an obscure young point guard seemed Jeremy [noise]\nDuring\nThe twelve games stretch Lynn average twenty two and a half points an eight point seven assist if you don't know basketball numbers but those are good ones Lin's success was so traumatic so an predicted that it produced movement [noise]\n[noise]\nWe grew up in California to parents who immigrated from Taiwan\nEven though we put up great numbers in high school he received no athletic scholarship offers to college he wound up playing Harvard while studying economics once again he put a great basketball numbers but when it came time for the NBA draft Jeremy Lin's name was not called\nThe Golden State warriors signed him as an ... drafted free agent making him the first American a Taiwanese or Chinese descent to play in the NBA but he barely played and three times that year the warriors send them down to their minor league club\nDuring the NBA's off season he played a few games in China\nThen the Knicks signed him and when sand that he broke out [noise]\nWhen\nIs now in his ninth year in the NBA he's in the final season of a three year deal worth thirty eight point three million dollars how could someone worth nearly Thirteen million dollars a year have been assigned a value of essentially zero\nBut that's one of the people who did take an early look at Jeremy Lin Darryl more a general manager of the Houston Rockets\nThe rockets have been one of the winningest team in basketball during mores tenure and he was just named NBA executive of the year\nMore he was also one of the first executives in basketball to make extensive use of analytics to help choose players so I asked him why Jeremy Lin's college numbers had not lit up his model\nWell and one thing that was talking about Germany 'cause he did actually producing college at a level that look you know insanely well I'm meaning if he had played at say Kentucky\nDuke or whatever for sure he would have been a top pick in the draft I have no doubt that the problem was he played at Harvard a and actually\nMost of the models that are used from an analytical perspective to forecast draft picks they're built on people who are drafted\nAnd Germany didn't look like anyone who was drafted the number of Ivy League players that have become MBA players is extremely small so one of the things you have to be careful both analytics is when did not use things um and\nI incorrectly chose to not weights uh his time an Ivy League high enough and we ended up going on drafted\nMaury end the rockets did however bring in into training camp as an ... drafted rookie\nActually did look quite good in our training camp but unfortunately at that time we had four point guards and so yeah we we either an incorrectly let him go\nWhat about his being Asian how much did that just you know the fact that he did not quote look lake what most basketball people think a good basketball player looks like and how much that may have actually obscured the the the real data\nTo sort of it I Know the question but the the founders of behavioral\nScience you know a lot of their research was on yeah how people mostly unconsciously some times overly put people into you know you know basically buckets a or categories and then use those for making decisions and often those serious six really serve you well in life\nI e you know I I've categorize that animal\nIs dangerous and so I'm going to avoid them so they don't eat me right but many times they don't serve you well and and a while you're asking is the question it's impossible answered specially how did a German heritage or change how he was viewed by NBA talented value waiters um\nBut I don't know how much was that Ivy League how much it was you know um yeah no nobody knows the reality was it happens you're not just in the NBA and having to consistently he was\nA top player in high school and he then got literally almost no interest from college had coaches but he should have been recruited by the due to the Kentucky and then again he was overlooked in the NBA no one can really know why but there's obviously a bunch of factors that probably played a role\n...\nAnd the people around them\nThe more you realize that the path to elite status isn't nearly as predictable as you might imagine there are cognitive biases involved there's personality in politics\nAnd remember luck\nPlainly there's no guarantee that given an athlete will get the right opportunity to make it to the town but\nThat's when the real challenge begins\nNow you've got to work even harder to vote yourself even more completely and that comes with the cause it's the flip side of opportunity and it's what economists call\nOpportunity costs meaning for every hour you spend on your sport\nSurrendered our if something\nEvery opportunity the sport gives you there's another opportunity you have to sacrifice\nSo fighting takes up a lot of time and um you know fighters they have to diet pretty hard\nBorn Murphy is a professional mixed martial arts fighter in the ... weight division of USC\nThey have to work out all the time they also need to rest a lot of us work so there's just not a lot of time in the day and a lot of times the first thing that kind of get taken off the plate is time with family\nAnd so I remember missing a couple Thanksgiving dinners um you know not being able to drive out to my sister's house for Christmas and I remember my family kind of being like what the hell [laughter] if I you know why are you suddenly neglecting us so much and ah\nI I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need this you know make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nThe high school you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share a\nWhy didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing football baseball you know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime plates Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably at high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that that core slows going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices\nTheir labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like no not going to do that\nSo instead you did was it American studies yeah let American studies when journalism right in journalism which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing football [laughter] no I um\nI enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nFor football and I say all that to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you give it up through the course of your life\n[noise]", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "year":
