{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Until in September of Nineteen Seventy eight he escaped from his room and he was on the list again\nHe so he wasn't Pearl is he was not paralyzed respect he was taking it for all those years or four years jeez yeah so he had a hit list apparently that was found in the cell it had the lawyers names on it had the prosecutors and the judge I think had like a whole bunch of people related to the case\nWith our money on their among his name was on that mhm and bell jeez I'm really so\nSo he leaves and ... and goes where\nNo one knows but he's not in the immediate area as far as I can tell they pull out all the troops again they're searching that's area that's like\nBrambles in dense brush around the prison\nAnd in the meantime this is our money's version I'm Henry McCabe same investigator from before during the manhunt shows up at his door\nTells him that girl has escaped again and says listen we had such a hard time catching him last time around is there anything you can tell us this time that might help us and our money says like oh jeeze yeah I mean\nI think what he's going to do is hunker down right next to the prison he is going to wait until he is going to be able to monitor you guys when he knows you've moved on and cleared the area and he'll make or break for it and go so probably he's still right nearby\nYou should go back and catch him how does he knows that well so that's the thing he Daryl basically I think talked about that on the stand to explain how he invaded during the manhunt so it's possible that this wasn't news but Armani claims that he told that to McCabe who thought it was helpful [noise]\nSo um they went back surface area again and sure enough he was there have popped up and he had managed to have a gun that had been smuggling him by his son a few days earlier and he shot the first officer that came near him and then all the officers open fire on him and he was killed\n\nSo-so look at where we land here like like this this is the small town lawyer who took on a case not because we want to do because he thought he should\nWho defended this fellow for all this time who suffered so for doing so many of his more or less give up his practice in small town it utterly changed his life and you're stuck to his guns and\nHe and he and he stayed with this guy and yet once he's escaped\nAnd he's at large and the police come and say tell us what you know about your client all of a sudden he does to you have to go to the bushes and those will seize nearby like that's interesting because because basically after all this he more or less sets up the situation where the the ...\nYeah it's like why is it okay in the second scenario and not\nIn the first scenario with the buried bodies right yeah well interestingly Lisa learning the or the ... the law professor that we spoke with for this episode she says that when she teaches this case to her law classes um you know like even if you\nPresume that this was privileged information which ... says it wasn't as Garrett talked about on the stand but at least ... says even if it were privileged information and only\nArmani knew he could still reveal it in this case ethically really why\nBecause you go back and look at roll one point six which is the current ethics code\nIt says a lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent that we're reasonably believe is necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nSo you could quibble about this you know is this just to meet that standard\nBut once Carol is on the loose\nYou know knowing what Frank knows about his having committed multiple previous murders\nMy reaction is that it was very reasonable\nBut in our case had the highway if\nHe had not had a hit list and when she looked like he was going to murder more people if he had not threaten their lives if instead he was going to sneak out and simply go to Rio on a plane and if you get to it then\nOur lawyers would not have been able to tell about the highway place because no one was going to die\nYou know if I had been representing this man [noise]\nAnd he was on the loose than if I knew that he had killed several people\nAnd that he is\nA sociopath or something like that I Would I Would estimate the odds of his injuring or killing other people as very high\nBecause serial killers that's what they do\nYou know if it were another case and he was just going to run off some place and there was no danger to anyone\nUh then maybe it would be different\nWhat is the argument that would be against that it was it let me see if I can think of it the argument against that is even if someone tells you a secret as his attorney or her attorney you're supposed to keep the secret when there is a\nConclusion of the case and the person who's either innocent or guilty how long must to keep the secret like\nForever set the forever forever why uh well the the the idea is that um if you want\nClients to be able to speak freely to their lawyers\nUm the the lawyer is simply the clients agent the lawyer has that information at the behest of the client it's not the lawyers decision\nTo reveal it\n[noise]\nThanks to our producers Brenna feral and Matt kill T and to a gym Tracey who's currently writing a book

with its trading partners the president's slapping new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from America's closest neighbor's an ally [noise] sometimes it gets a bit rough Canadians\nPolite where reasonable but we also will not be pushed\nA few weeks ago a new trade deals struck with our polite Canadian friends and with Mexico\nWe have successfully completed negotiations\nOn a brand new deal\nTerminate and replace\nAnd the NAFTA trade agreements\nWith an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nCalls us embassy a sort of\nUh these terrorists so there because they were negotiated over eighty years if you're talking about industrial tariffs audio talking about more than ten thousand lines\nTen thousand duties and that's the industrial only now you have to add to that the agricultural side you have to add to that a views on services as well and it's impossible to negotiate line by line\nAnd it's also impossible to apply a different terrorists to a different country imagine a situation where new applied the very same terrorists as the other is applied to U.\nYou'll have one hundred and sixty four countries and then you apply a different ... for that product for one hundred and sixty four and then they apply the same as yours how do you square that sort of cool is absolutely impossible so these negotiations were done\nOn a package so there is a balance a which is not mathematical it is essentially a political balance a debt is struck\nNow what I understand that the American position at this point in time is that we have to revise this now you know these were bad deals\nSo I'm simplifying of course I'm a very complex a scenario but it's just to say that we can understand a legitimacy and the ... of some situations but those situations I'm not there by accident or they're there because there were days or his\nBehind them and this is why we got to these a therapist in these commitments or negotiate that ended up ...\n[noise] well let me ask you this Trump's methodology and in addition to actually uh an acting terrorists that are larger and more dramatic than we've seen in the past his methodology is different in that he communicates directly to the world primarily via Twitter\nThe trade negotiations the WTO works on our multi year considered done around the table with a lot of negotiators in arbitrators and and they're kind of the opposite of a two hundred and eighty character political message\nAnd I'm really curious about\nThe degree to which those proclamations are essentially effective as a bargaining statements um and the degree to which they are chaotic\nI think ... the problem you have with short but very strong concise and clear a message is some time is that you get the concern\nYou get what the problem is or what is annoying that party but what you don't get is clarity about okay so how do we fix this sometimes the answer to this question\nIs very broad in nature and asked for things that clearly are impossible to do ah so the option on the other side is to either live with this uncertainty or\nTake action that assumes the wars\nAnd that I think is not the best way to proceed I think what we need to is not only to understand the concern what they need to understand now is so what what do we do know what are the things that we need to do reasonably\nSpeaking that can be done and how to actually you know roll up this leaves work and figure something out that is acceptable to everyone\nA that's a big challenge\n[noise] so are those challenges being met\nAre those long and hard conversations actually happening or are we in more of a kind of stormy holding pattern at the moment\nI think we are progressively moving forward and making progress I remember maybe a couple of years ago and there was a G ... meeting in in ... ah in China and I made a a a presentation and I\nExplained the situation of technology and the impact that it had in the labor market and they gave this figure no eighty percent of their jobs lost lost to new technologies everybody was surprised at what and that was just two years ago\nAnd some people came to me right there ... when we when we broke for coffee and said where did you get those numbers ... how did you get this information states so they're just not looking for that they're not looking for the causes of all this but if we do that causes a pretty evident\nIn two years' time uh everybody's talking about this now this is no news any longer\nAnd some are have already begun to talk about a reforming the system reforming the double a chill they realize that some of these concerns have roots in Fort coming up the system\nAnd unless we address this these kind of patients that we see today or in terms of trade are only going to increase\nIn addition to a President Trump critiquing the WTO itself calling it a disaster saying if they don't shape up I Will withdraw hum and his terrorist activity or\nThe U.S has also been blocking the appointment of a WTO appeals judge without whom the organization could really be a Siamese to to some large degree I'm curious if you could talk about what you are doing to try to keep the WTO from being paralyzed just I mean\nWe have to fix the situation as soon as we can by the end of next year ah we may reach a a critical moment when we have less than three appellate body members that means that with less than three we cannot hear an appeal and therefore\nBasically the system of dispute settlement collapses but having said that are members of looking at alternative is the first option of course is to get a conversation going\nThe misgivings of the U.S administration or with the dispute settlement mechanism off the W that show is not new\nUh I myself had heard that before from previous administrations people have been asking so if you're not happy with the system what do you think needs to change or how do we fix the problem is you you have of course some things are not negotiable\nThe system will have to continue to be independent it will have to continue to be impartial a buck it couldn't function better what is also a bit I'm a peculiar\nThat the United states has been bringing cases to the average oh they just brought five and a few weeks ago\nSo have you ah director general as if they do have direct conversations ever with President Trump whether about the blocking the appointment of the judge or trade self generally or anything if you have you had face to face or direct conversations with him\nNot directly no I Do have a open contacts of course with I'm Robert Lighthizer the U.S do our eyes sometimes have conversations um in in different scenarios with uh other ministers as well but not directly with President Trump no\nHave you had direct conversations with the leaders of other large a country's\nYes I'm quite frequently\nMet recently with President my comb are from France and um he was very concerned with all this and we had a very very good conversation and he was very much on top of what's happening that's surprising because I'm a wild back whenever I talk to leave there is a it took me a while to\nTo explain to them what was going on that this was not the case now ah talk to him I talked to a prime minister may I I I'm going to be next month in um in Germany or to talk with a\nA Chancellor Merkel I recently was in Japan or talk to reminisce or I'd be I'm a I've\nBeen covering a lot of ground and we've been talking and they're all concerned [noise]\nThere is a recent news that are the leaders of\nRussia and China have gotten together and boosted their newfound strategic a partnership\nI'm curious how you think about um [noise]\nYou know the WTO has positioned itself to be um theoretically a friend to all or at least the referee to all\nBut when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us ah terrorists and other countries respond by making their own deals I'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\nTo be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage or some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course I can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but um they're very very Frank and uh we explore all kinds of options are before\nUs I tell them about the importance of the system and not to compromise the system and I would say that pretty much everybody I talk to us\nYou mentioned that most people assume that job loss especially in manufacturing is due to you know trade issues whereas in fact technology is behind an awful lot of job loss and and we've discussed that on this program before we we discuss that\nWith I'm Christine Lagarde who who who made the point that that perception or maybe misperception\nA ... was and remains really a big part of a lot of the political movements or in Europe and elsewhere including Brexit\nAs you've mentioned people like to look for the villain I'd like to talk about Brexit for a moment I'd like to talk about what you feel a where the legitimate and maybe illegitimate factors that produced it\nAnd we're the WTO stands on it now what you're trying to accomplish well\nThe first thing to say about a Brexit in particular is that it tends to be bunch together with all of these other a phenomena that you see happening in the world are particularly in terms of protectionism um\nAnd I would say Brexit is somewhat different Brexit was a more a child of a migration policies and sovereignty issues\nAh of course are these things are difficult to quantify but I Would say they played a much bigger role than any kind of tension introduced by by trade\nSo that's the first distinction I Would say Brexit again is part of this transformative structural changes that we see out there a lot of ... a very significant part of the population feels left behind\nAnd they feel up somebody has to look at me I had something has to happen and nobody's doing that it was more like a ...\nGoing to vote rather than a vote for a certain political alternative\nIt was more the kind of vote off no more we need to change and people had better listen rather than having a clear a wealth formulated agenda for either social or political policies\nSo as everyone knows predicting the future of economics and politics and so on is really hard um to me one of the least predicted developments\nUm that very much affect global trade is the rise of the U.S as an oil exporter so it's estimated that next year the U.S will surpass Saudi Arabia to become the number one exporter in the world in large part because of fracking and other technologies\nI'm really curious to hear your thoughts on this considering that importing oil has for so long been a major part of not only the U.S economy but also us political concerns\nI think it will change things considerably even in terms of geopolitics um and I would say that what we're seeing this phenomenon that we're seeing with the uh uh shale oil is just the tip of the iceberg\nEvery a scientist every economist that uh has been digging into this uh tells me that we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in the energy field\nAnd that the cost of energy may go down very very significantly and that includes a electric energy so for example the combustion engine for the automobile industry some say is in the last stages I I don't know my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that\nFar [laughter] the economists them and law professor ... Bhagwati at Columbia has said this about um the world trading system he said it's characterized by a chaotic Criss crossing of preferences\nWith a plethora of different trade barriers applying to products depending on which countries they originate from this is a fool's way of doing trade\nOr it sounds as though you largely agree that uh that we get to where we get through a strange brew of evolution and history and best efforts and things changing over time so let me just leave you with the final question\nIf you as director general of the WTO had for a day or week some kind of magic wand [laughter] to make things\nMore equitable I'm more transparent tell me a few things that you would do to help make a little bit more order and equity out of this chaos\nI think the biggest challenge for us is to have a conversation I Would try to make sure that we\nGive space for more discussions whenever you said if if the two sides or three or four or how many sides\nA want a solution a solution will come I Will give you one anecdote something that happened with me actually I was at it and go shading table and we all had very significant political problems at home right\nAnd we were struggling with the language of a provision was very important provision ah for everyone\nAnd in the middle of the conversation I'm somebody said why don't we write this down like this and he gave up you know he'd drafted a sentence and I said\nWhat what the hell does that mean I don't understand the centers and the others said I don't either and nobody understood descent and says okay so that's that stake it's [laughter]\nNobody knew what it meant it but it it works for everyone precisely because nobody knew what it meant and then we got an agreement\nSo when you want things done you can find a way but we have to sit down and be determined that you want to solution\nI appreciate the call for conversation I assume if President Trump were to hear this conversation\nAnd call you um you'd be happy to to go visit and try to sit down and works and things out yet\nI'm always available and I'm always up and\nNext on freakonomics radio here's what we typically hear about the relationship between government economic growth\nMy God the government put a basket case the fear ... they don't know what they're doing today will hear an alternate take on that argument from the economists Mary on them out to\nMore episodes like this one check out our podcast archive on deter or re comics dot com where you'll also find our books the blog and much more\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target preventing future at heart upon counts time change makers and the contracts\nI'm getting in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie and cats or wherever pond cats are found\n[noise] common experts cars can act I look at the November ballot and how you the voter can have a say on the future of Jay\nI'm Melissa writes get plugged in with first cars connect sponsored by a Baptist Health and north Florida GPL Monday at nine AM on eighty nine nine to be Jaycee T.\n[noise]\n\nShe runs a family business that is a global brand\nYou know my dad had six kids I think the Lakers for his favorite people ask me if\nI'm a rebel Jeanie Buss the president of the Los Angeles Lakers next on on marketplace week nights at six or eighty nine nine W.
