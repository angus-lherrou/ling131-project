that's just an hour it opens in and out pops me\nBut you're saying that there's this thing that is reading these three base pairs and warming any of a hundred thousand proteins suddenly I'm thinking that's where the game is not not the DNA but in the thing is reading the DNA well yeah I mean\nDNA is just a totally meaningless molecule just flopping around unless\nThere is a way of\nReading it but doesn't the bill that the reader of the DNA come from the DNA sure his that's just weird yes so you have to say you have genes for\nThe parts of the ride this film at this point a producer to an hour and a pretty stern wheeler stepped in it's like a book that birth its own reader that's set will read the book not exactly though because that does you\nYou you are sort of putting DNA up on a pedestal\nBut it ... it ... it is a ... ... it is it's it's it's first but his ... how's DNA first what you're saying it's in the order of events you begin with DNA and then after that you get the ... events of\nWhat a view\nOkay but but you got to bear in mind that you I I don't know how far back you want to go [laughter] no seriously where do we start with you you want to start jazz the fertilized egg\nWell are you sure yes okay Chad the fertilized egg has DNA\nAnd these ... oh so the readers already present when a cell divides two new copies of DNA go into each new cell but they also divided up all the ... from the original cell so they're taking the factories with them\nSo the DNA is never without the code ... ...\nIt's like Moses with the tablets to gather\n[laughter] I'm a\nFigure there is a no and I just say I've never thought of it that way I Need to think about this um right what\nMakes the ... does it come from the DNA and so you just said that [laughter] yes it is that how does\nIt make the writers on without a driver on to help him make the robbers on what wait ... okay [laughter] well how he's going to translate or their unit coach for the rabbit zones and how do you make the writers on without a rabbit zone to translate the code to make the ... you couldn't wait a second I'm\nI'm so proud of you All right you got to take the DNA and the ... film partnership\nAll the way back billions of years these two parts of the system evolved and became dependent on each other very early in the history of life\nIn fact Carl says a lot of violence just think the life\nStarted out as just aren't they know DNA\nAnd so you basically have a these little little organisms that would have these little kind of proto genes made of are in a and eventually um these aren't any molecule\nStarted to connect amino acids together to make the little building blocks of proteins so you're saying that people generally think Arnie came first that is one of a couple I'm leading okay office he's today\nSo it's possible that aren't came first then DNA somehow suddenly I'm thinking oh we ... we should have been talking\nAbout our nail the along [laughter] well\nI mean just in general or nay has been incredibly neglected and ignored and\nThe Bible instead of in the beginning was word should have been in the beginning was the person reading the word or in the beginning was the code yeah [noise]\nDid you guys feel the ... just now\nI really know there there was some kind of vibration happening\nAnd in my head to because I was thinking if I finally get it now like I get it\nBecause then it got so to us is like this is the first step and understanding the mystery of life that somehow doesn't feel like that anymore suddenly like our name either so [noise] that's where the real mystery is\nLikely [noise]\nAnd soon discovers that we are\n[noise] is it true [noise]\n\nWho would buy a junior [laughter]\nIf I said I told you so you wouldn't be able

T. up in Jacksonville your community your world\n\nOf all the predictions the pundits have gotten wrong in recent decades one of the most compelling has to do with cities cities were supposed to die out\nThe proliferation of the automobile and everyone would move to the suburbs and never come back the decline of urban manufacturing\nCity itself would decline and then there's all the crime and noise pollution and chaos cities are known for who on earth would ever want to live in any city\nAs it turns out just about everyone we're in the middle of an historic and holy and predicted rise in ... happening here in America in all over the world\nOne problem many of our cities are old means they're not exactly optimized for the twenty first century and not so easy to retrofit an entire city\nAbout building a new city for the twenty first century and beyond from scratch\nIf you look at what I'd call successful cities cities that where there's a lot of demand in the population is growing which I by the way I think is the mark of a successful city I knew retracting customers people want to calm\nThe question that I think you posed this how do you actually manage supply and demand more effectively\nUm do you want more people to come I don't think you want to have slow that down because cities can either go to ways they can go up where they can go down you're not smart enough to ever manage it so that you can kind of keep things completely in balance so it really becomes a question of how do you produce more supply\nAnd there's really only two things that you need in order to do that you need land for people to build on and you need money in order to subsidize it for people at all income levels\nWe saw that right from the very beginning of the Bloomberg administration we believe the city was going to grow and that's why at a time when we had no money\nWe created what was to become an eight billion dollar affordable\nHousing program that produced a hundred and sixty five thousand units of affordable housing which basically means subsidized housing\nThe question is when you look back on it did we do enough and the answer is no we let demand get out ahead of supply\nIt was really a market timing issue and what what ended up happening\nWas we were keeping things more or less in balance for the first five or six years of the Bloomberg administration we were ... and the growth the prices weren't going up that dramatically homelessness in fact we're starting to come down then what happened was the financial crisis\nThe city actually in part because a lot of the other economic development initiative bounced back dramatically faster than ordinarily would have been the case in fact the city recovered faster than the national average for the first time following a financial panic crisis or bust\nYet when you have a financial crisis financing largely slows grinds to a halt and so there was a big pause in terms of the production of affordable housing and that's I think when supply and demand got out of whack\nAs someone who's been in business a lot before and after your political time so I guess grubby or corrupt or unworkable is politics compared to business\nIn New York City the amount of so called grogginess was I think minimal pretty much the only times that we had real problems with certain exceptions to this was when somebody from the state legislature actually gotten involved\nYou know a good story of of grogginess as we decide to re zone the waterfront in Brooklyn\nAfter World War two New York city literally lost almost all of its manufacturing and so the waterfront which had these spectacular views of Manhattan across the river had essentially been abandoned so it was\nYou know dilapidated War Z and warehouses and factories and so we decided we were going to turn it into you know one of the more desirable parts of New York fit for sort of eight twenty first century economy\nSo uh we worked on this resulting for about two years this was while I was bidding for the Olympics I literally on the day before the vote in the city council I arrived back from Korea where I was you know lobbying for votes\nAnd I called in the city hall because there was a snack in our re zoning it turns out that the state representative he'll veto Lopez from the district\nHad his hand out and what he wanted was a million dollars for a daycare center that I think his girlfriend had some involvement and and\nI literally after midnight called the head of the agency that oversaw sort of daycare centers woke him up in the middle of the night I'd never actually talk to him before I said you know you don't know me but I Need a favor\nCan I count on you for the million dollars for this day care center he said gras goalie yes and we got the deal done yep sometimes there were just like insurmountable obstacles they usually occurred at the state level the politics there really can be awful\nAt one point I think the New York times counted up and something like thirty five legislators had been convicted of various crimes that\nIncluded um the speaker of the state assembly as well as the Senate majority leader\nAnd let's not forget governors Eliot Spitzer of course\nWe're Eliot Spitzer to 'em and so we tried to avoid the state honestly as much as possible but sometimes we just couldn't avoid them a good example of that was\nThe stadium on the west side of Manhattan as part of the Olympic bid and as part of the Hudson Yards plan we propose a stadium over part of the rail yards that are on the west side\nAnd you know we just couldn't find a way to get around the state legislature and eventually this really one guy who was the speaker of the assembly who's been convicted of corruption\nBlocked it without a vote and did it for lots of reasons none of which I'm sure we'll ever know including the fact that he had a cozy relationship with Madison Square garden which opposed it I mean it's sort of went on and on and on\n\nComing up after the break what cities should and should not do to keep corporations happy\nProviding these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nFor city officials can and cannot predict the future I Will confess I didn't see that right away then Dr off is working on now the building literally move in the real meaning of the pilots city he's helping build in Toronto [noise]\nOur purpose here is to demonstrate how\nCombination of innovation and urban design can fundamentally bend the curve ball of the of life\nFreakonomics radio is

J. C. T.\n[noise]\n\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDamn doctor off started his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York then joined the Bloomberg administration to help New York recover from the nine eleven attack who then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today\nOne of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr off is chairman of president\nShed I'm just curious about the the why ... why\nDid New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts fiend at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and\nEffect is probably the most diverse large city in the world but what's actually happening and comes back to some of the conversation we're having earlier is because it's growing so fast\nThere are increasing pressures on affordability on mobility and how people get around all of that is pushing middle income and lower middle and lower income people out from kind of access to employment ah which is creating opportunity challenges\nThere so committed to this notion of inclusion but ironically because that openness is produced the pressures\nThat are making it harder to be inclusive they're very open to new approaches\nAnd so we want to create a place um ultimately of large scale that can be a laboratory for innovation across sort of every urban system including mobility\nUm sustainability building form and design public space and then even community and social services and which we leverage technology to fundamentally bend the curve on a lot of those quality of life metrics\nWhen you say create a space just to be clear you're talking about this is essentially a physical neighborhood you're building correct we think of it as a district\nAnd can you just talk about what would be the most overt I guess futuristic elements of the construction of this area for instance I assume that a lot of functions that are currently above ground and a lot of cities like ... delivery in trash disposal those will not be above ground\nAll of that is true but I think the thing that will have the most profound impact is if you don't allow traditional vehicles particularly automobiles into the district so\nIt's all autonomous um summoned vehicles and essentially yes\nThat's our and and ideally much more shared than they are today\nSo if you begin to do that the consequences are cruelly profound than a typical North American city thirty to forty percent of the land\nUm is dedicated to parking or the separation of roadways that these highly dangerous vehicles demand if you begin to carve most of that back\nYou can create greater density you can also however dramatically increase the amount of public open space if you can begin to put people very close to open space and you can figure out ways\nTo weather rise that particularly in places like Toronto where the weather is not so nice a large percentage of the time\nThen maybe you can begin to re conceive space in people's apartments in New ways which will also be enhanced by enabling people to store a lot of their stuff off site because with autonomous delivery it'll be much easier and convenient\nAnd you combine that with new approaches to construction like modular construction or perhaps cross laminated timber\nThen you can begin demeaning flee lower the cost of housing you combine that lowering the cost of housing with lowering the cost of mobility which we believe is really possible by as much as fifty percent and you can begin to see cost of living decreases that are\nMeaningfully end of the double digits\nKnow the people who lived there as I understand it are opting in to a program to have a great deal of their personal data gathered because this is a laboratory and you want to learn as much as you can from the day to help people move around and communicate and so on\nOne interview you gave you said that the data really shouldn't be used to be commercialized um but this is a project run by funded by a company Google for whom commercializing data is it's actual business models so\nWhy on earth would we think that these data won't be commercialized and why on earth shouldn't we think that this entire project is just an extension of Google's already monolithic reach\nWe're just going to have to demonstrate to people through agreements engagement um specific actions that that's not our intent at all and by the way it's not Google or alphabet intent at all either\nOur purpose here is to demonstrate how\nThat combination of innovation and urban design can fundamentally bend the curve on quality of life and to extend data gets used it's going to get used for those purposes but we have to prove it to people and memorialize that in different ways and\nThat we will do so we understand the skepticism and we will satisfy people over the course of two thousand and Eighteen which is our year to really put the plan together including privacy and data protection plans of our intentions\nSo yeah I mean look I Believe in something called the virtuous cycle of successful city\nYou know the object of a city should be to grow and that is grow the number of residents grow the number of jobs grow the number of visitors\nBecause the marginal revenue of those additional people is greater than the marginal cost and that you can take that net profit if you will and reinvest it back\nIn quality of life in the city and affordable housing and education and safety and social services and when you do that and you improve quality of life more people come perpetuating the virtuous\nWhen can I moved there\nWell if all goes well\nYou know the first people could probably move in in maybe five years or so but then that would be a place to proto type a lot of the interesting ideas and approaches but obviously a lot of the systems have to scale into a larger area this is a\nProject that would you know take Fifteen to Twenty
