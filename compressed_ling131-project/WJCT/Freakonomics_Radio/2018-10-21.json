Rated movie theater\nAnd now it's the front page of a newspaper and all those things the same time it's all those things at the same time in in what we hear the users are demanding of them is that they create a set of policies that are just and the reality is justice means a very different thing in each one of these settings\nJustice would mean that the person in Mexico gets told the truth in Mexico by Facebook and the little boy in England and doesn't have to look at something gory and horrible in England but you can't put them together because they clash exactly so how do you solve that\nThe I don't know I I think it's important to keep in mind that even if you have the perfect set of policies that that somehow managed to be just in different settings and that can be consistently enforced the people at the end of the day making these decisions they're still\nThere's still people they're still human being is this working or no they can hear it yeah\nI spoke to one woman who did this work for Facebook I wanted to be a non you must will call her Marie she's from the Philippines where she grew up on a coffee farm\nThat's my father is a girl she said many afternoons well she was growing up she and her mother would sit together like outside tuning into their short wave radio\nThey're listening to the voice of America\nI'm drawing a vow I had been proud\nMimi greyhound went up to date eventually\nI'll find baseball this guy [noise] but then [noise]\nForward fifty years to twenty ten and Marie is consuming a very different sort of American media\nThere were times when I felt really bad that I Am a Christian and then I ended up into this things\nShe became a content moderator back in twenty ten and she and the other moderators on her team who lived throughout the Philippines they were trained on the guidelines on this rule book\nBased on my concern about the background there are things that that I cannot know objectively I so I usually check many of the things that I think are not\nAcceptable she said whether something was outside the rules are not if her got told her to she just took it down\nBecause if it's going to disturb the young OB GYNs and he should not be there so like\nIf there's a new person\nWhether it was the breast feeding photo or an anatomy video or a piece of art and what's going to sit there at pornography\nNo yeah I have to protect kids\nFrom those\nA sign of humankind [noise]\nLeisurely feelings they'd be feeling that this is just that at the end this is just I'm a new\nUm [noise] I I I think they will inevitably fail but they have to try and and and I think we should all be rooting for the [noise]\n\nThe Florida Times union editorial staff probably presents Jay a new magazine dedicated to the rebirth of Jacksonville downtown on newsstands at select gate dailies and publics locations more info at Jacksonville dot com\nFlorida was an important training ground during World War two and the population of the state exploded after the war\nI broke my ankle and coming up on Florida frontiers the weekly radio magazine of the Florida Historical Society will visit the world war two exhibit at the museum of Florida history in Tallahassee we'll discuss early soil survey maps and Florida's first professional football team\nThat voter frontiers Monday evening at six thirty on TV nine nine W.

Jacksonville your community your world [noise]\n\nLast week we were talking to the journalist Franklin for about his latest book world without mind the existential threat to the big\nTen ... ... my argument is against the big technology companies which really are racing to expand into every ... of our lives\nWe spoke with for a year ago his book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nThat since become relevant just because\nThey fired about ... and critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from\nGoogle chairman Eric Schmidt right\nSo how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nIt it actually does it feel good because New America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavowed them when they've been so nice to me but this does feel exactly reflective of a much\nBut the management does I think there is a general tension wherever you need to protect the integrity\nOf research and you also need to fund that research\nNew America says all its major funders are listed on its website we asked sorter for a breakdown only twelve\nPercent comes from corporations are the rest comes from foundations by far the largest amount comes from foundations and then from private individuals\nTaking corporate money does not mean necessarily that the work of the entire institution is suspect Barry Lynn again\nBut it definitely can create a slippery slope that will lead to pressure is being brought to bear on those people who are questioning concentrations of power or the use of corporate power and other ways\nI think people are right to have a kind of skeptical maybe cynical orientation to what was called corporate lobbying or corporate philanthropy\nAnd that's Robert reach a political scientist at Stanford he's written a new book called just giving why philanthropy is failing democracy and how it can do better\nResearch interest these days focus a great deal on ...\nYou're ... and the ... plays in democratic societies\nAnd that philanthropy increasingly comes in the form of foundation [noise]\nThere are lots of foundations what is the media and size of assets it's really small right a million or so dollars so yeah it's not much got maybe a couple of million dollars but there's enormous growth in the number of foundations\nAnd that's just the kind of logical consequence of growing inequality and in the United states just talk about\nYour thesis essentially the role the influence and the complications around modern philanthropies\nStart by saying most people's attitude about philanthropists foundation says that we should be grateful that people are trying to do good with their with their own money\nAnd that's the attitude I Want to try to sweep away I don't think philanthropists deserve that amount of charity if you will why is that because ... especially large philanthropy in the form of a foundation or especially wealthy person\nRepresents the exercise of power which they attempt to use their own private wealth to affect public outcomes or to produce public benefits or make social change\nAnd power deserves scrutiny in a democratic society not gratitude I'd add on top of at the foundation in particular which is a a a legal form that allows a wealthy person to create a\nDonor directed unaccountable fairly transparent perpetual and tax subsidized corporate form\nIn order to use their private assets to affect the public uh me as a especially um interesting and potentially worrisome form of power\nLet's talk about think tanks per se um is there such a thing as a truly nonpartisan think tank or\nIs it just too hard because of where the money's coming from\n[noise]\nWell I I'd say that you're more likely to make the case that there are a non partisan universities universities which are funded and not entirely dissimilar ways from think tanks I'm a well officially they have to be nonpartisan so so do you think tanks to in other words they can't declare themselves in favor of particular political candidates\nBut think tanks had become far more popular in the United states as a result of the polarization and inequality in the states so that the idea generation that happens in think tanks and the policy framework some proposals that get disseminated from think tanks\nFlow from philanthropic interests with particular policy positions in mind\nTell me what she know about Google's history of philanthropic or ... foundation or think tank giving and especially the timeline because I understand that accelerated quite a bit recently\nYeah so Google like lots of other tech firms has gotten much more aggressive in its formal lobbying efforts and I think it's now the case that the\nTop five Silicon Valley companies um are amongst the largest sources of lobbying um greater even then the five top Wall Street firms and I'm In New York\nAnd there's been a parallel wrapping up of the ... that's associated with the tech firms that science becomes in a variety of different forms\nSo Rob knowing what you know about the situation with the New America foundation and the Google money and the controversy what would your advice be for them for the New America foundation\nThe New America foundation needs to be aware of the soft power the agenda setting influence that donors can have\nTo the think tank even in the absence of calling somebody up and saying we disagree or we object to the work that someone does\nSo when Emory slaughter whose job is chiefly to ensure the existence of of the New America foundation into the future which involves fundraising\nDoes her work she needs to be cautious that she hasn't internalized the policy preferences of the donors\nSuch that she shapes the work of the foundation around the donor interests\nThe idea is you're worried about the conversation you'll have with your donor in the future and so you orient the work that you do to please the donor rather than to displace the donor and that has functionally the same outcome from the donors perspective without even having\nTo say anything now your\nOwn fine university Stanford benefited was founded from the large as a private largest ... Stanford who\nYou know most of history paint him as a classic robber Baron a railroad after the man who uh who did all kinds of stuff that we would frown upon today talk to me about that and whether that's a conversation that takes place regularly at Stanford or is it avoided\nSo I'd say people here are aware of the history of the university and the deep connection between philanthropy and the wellbeing of especially well the universities\nAre people here I think you know something about the history of Cleveland Stanford and ah so there is an effort on campus too on earth the sordid history of the universities initial benefactor\nHas there been any movement of any kind of magnitude to rename the university\nNot that I Know of their starting with lower hanging fruit other monuments and places on campus named for people with no obvious connection to the university and who's historical records are\nNot so appealing so let's say I have some money Rob name your figure and I want to set up a foundation came in I come to you and I say you know I'm a big believer in\nBringing critics into the inner circle and I know that you've been critical of how foundations behave\nAnd that it's undemocratic and so on but you know Rob I'd like to make you the director\nMy foundation the executive of my foundation and let's say I made my money in a\nAmmonia fertilizer how would you go about setting it up in a way that takes advantage of my large s to try to accomplish something that we could all agree some kind of public good without falling into all the traps that you've been describing to us\nSo at first I'd say despite the fact that laws don't require me to be especially trans parents about what the foundation is doing\nI pledge to make completely available to the public all of the grant making we'd do the evaluations of the grants that we make\nI Want to invite in outside experts as well and I would want to find ways in which to organize a foundations efforts to seek out the most severe critics of what we're doing in order to try to learn the most in order to give grants away to greater effect\nAnd uh I'd like to see possibly experimentation with a former foundation peer review and which you know an effort analogous to what happens in academia happens within the foundation world\nIt would be surprising if the philanthropic habits of corporations were purely altruistic corporation seek to advance their own interest especially in their lobbying quite possibly often in their philanthropy\nI'm trying to stimulate people to be morally awake and in the same moment to get people to consider what type of public policies are frameworks ought to governance structure our collective lives which is a moral and philosophical question [noise]\nWas the Stanford political scientist Robert ... we also heard from Anne Marie slaughter Barry Lynn and Franklin for [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio [noise] why do we choke under pressure\nTo feel like for me it was terrifying [noise]\nFreakonomics rainy I wasted forty by target presenting future at heart and new podcast that explores the work and change makers across the country and highlights projects in cities

explain the worst shooting at home is there may be another explanation the\nSecond this location is that usually they were from the ... with us in the very ultimate six months or\nThey don't look around they don't care about anything probably when you perform at home something are\nJust starving [noise] who tells us that by athletes usually perform the shooting in a very automatic manner that sounds like it might be relevant to our choking discussion so what exactly does that mean\nTo the psychologist see on by luck\nWe know that sometimes people don't perform up to their potential um precisely when they want to the most and sometimes that happens because people pay too much attention to the details of what they're dealing details that should be left on auto pilot\nAt the human performance lab by lock and her colleagues did an experiment with expert golfers and novices\nSo we set up a pet ingrained in our lab and when we tried to asked experts for their memories of how they'd taken apart\nThey couldn't tell us so much about it the novices the people who are just learning could tell us way more and we thought wow this might be an indication that these high level coffers aren't paying so much attention to what they're doing and so one of the reasons that they might perform poorly under stress is when they start paying attention\nThe wave just put that would not be that surprising to anyone who follows let's say golf per se right\nIt is true that um you know sometimes athletes have these these moments of feelings of being in his own but I think you know we often don't think about this idea that paying too much attention could actually be counterproductive can share coaches yelling concentrate all the time\nAnd so being able to actually show that when you're at this high level you're not paying attention to detail and one of the reasons you mess up it's because you start paying attention to those details allowed us to start asking questions about how we prevent you from paying attention to the details\nWhat is it that people actually or thinking about what they're doing boating Anders\nEricson also did putting experiments in his lab at Florida State with somewhat different results\nSo we actually asked our participants to think out loud and recruited skilled and less skilled individuals\nAnd what we found was that the skill individuals they were actually verbalize more about thoughts and basic factors that they were taking into account in order to actually decide how they were going to put the puck so their argument is that\nIf you're really skilled you're actually generating our rich description here of the situation so you're trying to take into account here how basically the ball would roll and where you need to aim in order to have the appropriate ... path\nSo I Know that some psychologist argue that what separates the better performers the top tier performers from the rest of us\nIs you know some form of auto maturity rate that you're going into some free flowing state is dependent on all your talent inexperienced et cetera but you're not actually engaging in a cognitively you're saying that's not what you found\nWhat we're finding is that experts are able to make adjustments you know when they're performing so if you're a musician and the acoustics them in a given performance environment is different you can actually make\nAdjustments in the same way the soccer player you know when the situation changes they can actually make adjustments appropriate to that situation\nSo let me ask you this Anders to what degree do you believe that choking is the factor or a main factor that actually separates an absolute topped your performer from someone who's talented and so on but doesn't reach the top tier in other words is the expert is the professional\nThe very good performer who has learned to not choke\nMy experiences the choking is quite rare by those individuals that we study who are consistently excelling and it it seems to be almost part of being an expert is that you deal with\nThe kind of situations that would be you know experience is very high pressure for other people [noise]\nThat's an interesting continuum\nHigh pressure performances can lead to choking but experts performers who could be under pressure all the time and to not show [noise]\nFor me it was terrifying\nJeremy Abbott was one of the best figure skaters in the world he won the U.S men's championship four times and went to the Olympics in two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen things didn't go so well at the Olympics opening where the quiet town right here\nNot that many together [noise]\nHard fall there this\nIt was unlike any other situation I'd ever been in all of my practice and all of my preparation uh once I got to the games everything really kind of leading up to that moment both Olympics in Vancouver and in Sochi I was really excited I could see the rings and the moment I went out uh in Vancouver and and so she\nEvery insecurity that I had about myself and about my skating which just magnified by a million I'm and I was just so focused on not wanting to make a mistake I was in the wrong mindset\nBoth times Abbott failed to metal in the individual events he retired from competitive skating in two thousand sixteen and you know coaches in Detroit he uses his own experience to help the next generation\nI should have been focusing less on outcome a and less on um performance and more just on the process and and getting my job done and ... and ... and accomplishing what I Do every
