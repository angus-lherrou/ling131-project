[noise]\nAnd I'm ... and joined us friday for the Florida round up where we talk about the biggest stories in the state from politics to education the environment and more if its news in Florida we want to hear from you\nLet your voices be heard joined the conversation on the floor on Fridays at noon on W. J. C team [noise]\nI Am Ira Flatow this week on science friday we traveled to the moon and back with Neil Armstrong and the new film first man may have every intention of coming back but you\nHow well did he captured the personal side of Armstrong the space race or the excitement of space travel\nThat's all on science friday from WNYC Studios\nFriday at three one eighty nine different Jaycee to your community your more [noise]\n[noise] we're continuing our discussion now about national team driver safety week with Matthew pause gay at cooker law and Trish Johnson creator of the apex virtual vehicle\nOr now this virtual simulator which she recently uh\nFor the kids at Wilson High school is a way to fill the gap or over the way vehicles roads in traffic have changed over the last half century but drivers ed courses have now what what are some of the differences and what did the kids learn\nSure saying well we've provided this virtual vehicle to also high school for their freshman to use the freshmen will have an opportunity for the reluctance class to be there and get three training sessions during the year\nIt gives them an opportunity to be in a less stressful environment and to gain practical experience in driving which is the safest way for them to learn\nThey don't have parents who stressful enough next to them ... and a lot of it is they can do it on their own and then they can look back and see the skills that they are strong out and the skills they need more help with\nWithout being criticized or or treated in a bad way so it's really an opportunity for them to learn in a controlled environment less stressful and and get the experience they need\nNow trash when you and I were sixteen ... getting the driver's license was very very important and the minute we got it we were out and rolling not true anymore no why is why is that\nWell you're absolutely right Twenty years ago about Fifteen Percent of high school seniors did not have a license\nAnd now that number is thirty percent yeah so we had to stop they're not as eager to dry they aren't there there I think there are many factors the cost of driving a car is certainly part of that for some families are\nTeenagers today with technology can connect with their friends without ever leaving their bedroom that's the other big part of it isn't it yeah but I've been able to work with a lot of local families and it's kinda like peeling onion and when you get to the very bottom of it it usually comes out that they were just terrified\nThey knew that they were not ready to be out on Atlantic boulevard and the only way they were going to be able to drive was to\nKind of suck it up and get out there in and try to make that work and and they just they're completely overwhelmed and cities have gotten more crowded and more dangerous they have roads have gotten more dangerous they have and again these this generation is not coming into the driving process\nWith a lot of the against skill set that that my generation have so their skill set is low but they're awareness is extremely high and they know they're unprepared they know the roads are dangerous um so they just kind of opt out and many times will come up with a lot of excuses why\nThey don't want to drive when the reality is they're just terrified when they come in and work with me at the virtual vehicle or certainly for the Wilson students now it gives them that safe learning environment\nNow the virtual vehicle is open to any parents out there that wants to train their teen\nOr how can people get a session how can they train their budding team driver on this simulator\nYes I I I Do have an office locally so they can go to a packs resource center dot com and get more information about the sessions that that we conduct\nApex resource center dot com or to do this I'm going to be doing this uh we've got a Fifteen year old who really needs is and poker law as well uh is part of this campaign safer streets through smarter drivers anything else plan with this\nIt's something that is just the beginning of what we'd like to do to make the streets safer in our community um\nWith Trish at Wilson High school was great the leading causes of teen crashes of those eight leading causes for them or dealt with directly with this virtual vehicle but we're looking at other alternatives other things we can do in the community whether it's expanding it with other schools but also other initiatives we can do to make the streets safer for Jacksonville\nI'm sure there are schools would love to have this come to their campus it's something we're looking into yeah and I'm sure the juniors and seniors would like it to\nMy daughter's a sophomore she already has her learners permit yeah me too but she herself has gotten so much more experience and confidence behind the wheel by using the virtual vehicle\nIt so it really does it it's a virtual reality immersion you really feel like you're on the road\nAbsolutely yeah and the scenarios that you're going to deal with are going to be exactly what you're going to deal with\nThat one the first coast but we can duplicate it we can have a ... and a great example it it's really terrifying how many of my students have come up to an intersection and turn left in front of an oncoming car\nAnd individual vehicle I can let them make that mistake and it ends up being a crash and they have this deer in the headlights look they have no idea what on what happened\nIf you're out on the road practicing with them you have to yell stopped somehow\nAnd that's where the disconnect happened they know that their parents is yelling to stop but the reason why they don't understand so what happens when you're out on the roads driving\nYou have to do as a parent you have to do a lot of the heavy lifting you can allow them to do what they will naturally do and that's why when young people get a license the first few months so many of them have crashes right and\nIt's why so many parents have gray hair [laughter] this is a really great way to address this it is a national team driver safety week go to apex resource center dot com to access the apex
