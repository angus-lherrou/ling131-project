{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "And that makes the national news yeah the impact would be devastating\nRoger let me ask you clearly you are putting this at the feet of Governor Scott but is there any uh blaming your mind to a senator Nelson and a a federal response or lack there of during his tenure in the United States Senate especially\nWell it could be I mean I guess he could have voted maybe he did attempt to do something and just couldn't get it done I don't know\nUm you know all this talk about the Diet Coke ... coca ... and so forth but you know red tide is is is red tide and and Mother Nature has the last say in gets revenge and you add Rick Scott right here in Florida who has seen this and for seven and a half years\nHurt the environment and now in an election year and the last six weeks or so before the election finally gives our southeastern counting some money to fight there's where was he for the past seven and a half\nRoger we gotta thanks for checking in from Miami Beach Mac let me put this to you are you a are a veteran of all a lot of gubernatorial Senate campaigns here have you ever seen\nOr the environment play the kind of role it's playing here in twenty eight teen this late in the election cycle certainly environment can play a role in the summertime when we've seen these algae blooms before but they have tended to die off or reduce by the time we get into October\nYeah if if Yellen was the best thing that happened to a Bill Nelson a red tide is the worst thing that has happened to Rick Scott and there's a tendency as the caller just did to conflate a whole lot of things that I'm\nA may not quite be fair and somebody can correct me but I don't think anybody knows what causes red tide uh we've been\nBecause it's a algae and a bacterium in its natural Haram unlike the blue green tied which is not naturally occurring the red tide is a natural occurrence\n... that's exactly right and this year it is much worse than it normally is a is usually around I think if you go back to the early Eighteen hundreds and you can see records of red tide so I'd I'd\n... there's always say that if you're the governor you're going to get the praise and you're going to get the blame\nA you know you you could go out and pick a thousand people at random in the state of Florida\nTell them you were going to shoot him if you didn't if they didn't name at least one of the presiding officers you present as senator speaker of the house you'd have to shoot nine hundred and Ninety six ... other four would be related to Negron or a courtroom\nSo the government gets the blame he gets the credit or I'm not sure the blame is well placed on the ... the red tide thing though\nTom to your point of this is such a fascinating issue because as a pollster I've always looked at the environment and it's never ever the most important issue even though a lot of people are passionate about it people think it's an important one when you actually try and prioritize never rises\nWhat I think is different about both the red tide and the algae bloom issue and the reason it's factor so late is it's a visceral this is an issue that is now outside of the uh fear Merle and it's in people's lives it's literally stinks in their eyes and knows in their eyes\nAnd yeah it's it's right in your face let me ... in a couple of minutes we have left let's point out that vote by mail has already started in Florida so really the election is officially underway either way it's the first time ever since Florida became a two party state that more Democrats than Republicans are asking\nTo cast their ballot through the postal service that said uh intensity I think is up on both sides are for not for not an Mac as we close out this program\nYou said at the top of the ... that this recalls Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton which I thought was really interesting analogy [noise]\nHave you ever seen a governor's race quite like this in Florida with these two really different candidates and miss much rancor and partisanship this is really I think one for the books for not\nNo way in a nutshell why because this is the most nationalized governor's race for Florida that I think we've ever seen certainly in my lifetime I think Mac would probably agree\nThis race is a referendum for what is happening nationally you have two candidates representing what a lot of people think are on the extreme wings of their party and as the twenty Eighteen midterms have really become a a referendum on Donald Trump people are looking at this Laura governor's race and\nLet's not forget he or she who wins the governor's mansion in Florida is usually a tremendous indicator of who's going to carry forward is twenty nine electoral votes and that's why not only there's so much attention in drama it could be so determined demand definitive once again Florida in the middle of everything\nYeah it's really good at it really is as I said in the beginning the most interesting governor's race in in in my memory um you know I'm Gillum is a progressive he's a liberal liberal he is a great society new deal\nDemocrat and he's unapologetic about it and doubling down on it um I think that the Sanchez is trying to slowly and suddenly maybe slide away from Trump towards the center of just a little bit whether you'll succeed or not I don't know but this this is a this you're going to be a pier six brawl that's pretty\nGood [noise] well and the center still holds in Florida doesn't it uh despite the polarization in this country it's so centrist voters particularly the ice for court are still write that could make that the difference in this\nWell I don't know I'd ... I'd furnished down out on that I don't I don't I I kinda just generally feel like the Florida much like the country that the ... center is pretty hollowed out ... I'm\n... I Would agree with that I I think this race is going to be determined by what determines every race for the Democrats why do Democrats now when an off year ... elections it's turnout\nAnd even to turn outbreaks sixty percent statewide which I think it does if it breaks fifty percent in South Florida which I think it will I think it's going to mean Andrew Gillum is going to be the next governor the state of Florida\nYeah rich got one very narrowly twice drop one very narrowly ... you know in Florida but did you go back to the off year election was Scott if Broward County had voted he wouldn't know what\nThat's exactly what I Would have been much much much Lenny ten and twenty fourteen mhm yep [noise]\nWhile we've got a early voting are underway and just two weeks and of course we're I'm about thirty days out from election day itself a really great times here and we'll continue to have these conversations statewide every Friday noon here on your radio statewide in Florida Fernando ... the Democratic pollster from Nixon in ... with us in Miami\nAnd max van a bitch a GOP strategist with us from our sister station WFSU in Tallahassee gentlemen thanks so much for your time today appreciate your insight thank you both\nLike you great great\nDiscussion thanks gentlemen and that is our chauffeur today the Florida roundup is pretty W.
