J. C. T. R. churning turning on the the the TV [noise]\nUh but some of these broadcast um are delayed the information is delayed because you know people are waiting should they evacuated shelter in place you know is is the shooter still is is are are they still active\nAnd and we have to and through this campaign encourage our stations to provide that effective communication a bike including that interpreter and making sure that that interpreter or has the credentialing to provide that information\nStephanie Monroe you a help provide that through the independent living resource center right yes\nMan on everything that all the interpreters that we use for these need ... news broadcast and emergency services and things that are anti me trying to get the information out the people who need them need the information they're all nationally certified they all have a level to background screening said there will not be\nInstances where all the information or incorrect information is put out the deaf community\nAnd the as you mentioned a moment ago the most recent incident in the city where you helped police was after the mass shooting at the Jacksonville Landing doctor you had\nA certified interpreter they're standing next to the sheriff or whoever it was getting the information out it's so important\nI was the interpreter butter on it right there you go to vote yes um\nAnd here's a tweet from Lauren I'm a sign language interpreter and I'd like to know if this interview you're talking about now will be broadcast with captions\nSo that are deaf community can participate we don't have the capability to do this here at W.

I always ask out an individual to turn on the captioning and try it for yourself and see the pace and the level of language that comes across and closed caption can you keep up with that pace\nCould or others children or other people who may not have be able to access information from captioning still also have that great opportunity to have it through a sign language interpretation okay\nSo it's so fascinating to learn about this movement\nCalled stop the crop if you had to take that on social media and you can learn more and Tyler Moore is what else is happening to get the word out about this how can people be part of this we couldn't fix or we couldn't fit six hundred people\nAre in that room today yeah we have six hundred signatures and growing this morning a about individuals that are wanting change ah and in some of the the narrative that's coming behind it on the reason why personally it's important to them is is great to see so\nYou know a jacks disability dot org is our is our website I access and stop the crop or you can also find us on social media\nBut this is an important time for change and we want to include our media partners and change and we have the groundswell asking for that an advocacy component and it's as simple opportunity up panning out including our interpreters and providing effective communication\nAnd if people want to become an interpreter they can reach out to you to be trained to write\nYes we can at least point them in the right direction and share with them the credentials that we're looking for it's called stop the crop uh so important for the deaths\nIn hearing impaired community and for every one we were all safer if everyone's getting the best information so\nThanks for shutting some light on this today everybody I appreciate you bring this to our tension thank you know we were joined by Tyler Moore is executive director of the independent living Research Center Stephanie Monroe their interpreter manager and board member and interpreter doctor Suzanne Ehrlich again\nAnd stop the crop if you want to research that movement via the hash tag and that's our show thanks for\nListening thanks to all of our guests and callers our producer is Kevin ...
