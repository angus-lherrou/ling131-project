[noise]\n[noise]\nWell finally this hour it's a diverse literary portrait of life in Jacksonville from the beaches to the urban core and beyond Fifteen views of Jacksonville short stories from a bold city is out today Jared ... come out of bridge eight presses behind this new project and joins us now\nGo mourning mourning this is a beautiful book and you raised the money for it on Kickstarter congratulations\nThank you we did we didn't we uh felt like this book was very much a community project\nI'm we gathered Fifteen writers or it ended up being sixteen Fifteen short stories and one essay um we felt like a the Jacksonville community would want to be behind something like that so we launched kick started back in July and reach their goal by a hundred and twenty percent\nNinety thousand dollars nine thousand dollars and what is inside this book which is on sale and independent bookstores all over town is Fifteen short stories and an essay about the city from local author\nYes it's a short story set in different parts of Jacksonville and the idea was that um no matter\nWhere you traveled to ... or where you grew up you you have a different idea of what it is um for example if you lived or travel to a point of view drag you have a different idea that if someone went to Orange Park for example very different parts and and we want to have stories that were set and and the different parts of that\nSo we can maybe better understand or said he has a whole\nHow did you choose the writers and these stories\nI'm a long process [laughter] we um first needed them to either live here now or have lived here in the past and have close ties to the city um and then we had a narrow down because they need to have close ties with the district\nAnd we want to represent as many of our our parts of town as possible so narrowing it down to there and then it came down to quite honestly schedules I'm short stories are hard to write especially ones that are true inauthentic\nAnd so I'm getting all of these writers to write us pieces I mean it was amazing\nThat these are there are great stories in this book and you are the publisher your imprint is called bridge aid press is that or is that a reference to the bridges of Jacksonville it is it is okay\nUm there's seven bridges famously in ... and the eighth bridge we I'm calling metaphorical bridge it bridges um people's and it bridges development and culture and in and bridges a lot of things um our big pushes that stories build the bridges and Bridgette inside the outcome of that\nCame out of that now a lot of people like you have come here from somewhere else so you have a different perspective on Jacksonville than a native person\nIt's hard to define I guess uh it's it's a city that's hard to define but more and more people are trying to give it an identity and this is I guess one way of doing that\nExtremely difficult and that's probably why isn't anthology of stories rather than a book about it um\nFrom one author rate um\nEspecially coming in here seeing it from a different perspective I wanted to know the Jacksonville that locals do and maybe not locals that people are from here\nPeople who were born here and I'm a raised and grew up here I wanted to see Josh I'm from that side to 'em and then I also wanted to interspersed people who have um moved here what do they see when they see Jacksonville as well do you have a favorite\nUm I'm going to hold that whole ... they're all really awesome or the intro really does get turned to the book um we're very excited to have
