I went to a really do enjoy the the the the the surprise element of surprise you know\nThere's nothing like taking a strain on August ... in the recording studio and you know this is the first time is to be played ... and then take it and turn it all around you know let's say maybe beneath ... stations might sound too good\nWe don't want to stay home to sound too\nGood to young you wanted to know about collaboration and now you know\nThis is the ... the real story no no no no no no sometimes you know sometimes\nPeople come and you know I guess some I get an idea of somebody getting you know I Do all we have a job to do that to be done and sometimes I made a little help\nYou know he never need to know what I Do a suite of four parts I mean he I think that we should do three of the movement nice you know what to do one I had the responsibility of presenting yet and being on stage when\nWe did and you know I mean no I'm the one who's going to catch it\nNo matter whether the ... what it is you know and now that if it's a big success I had the tremendous responsibility of having to Bob\nWhat do you do really when he does the\nInterviewer just ask what Billy dogs ...\nWell uh I I Would like to believe that Billy is our number one track [laughter]\nYes I'm the backstage clack\nHe buys magnificent they said oh it's nothing like the lord you know the great thing it's a wonderful thing I Need to balance a and after that we stay on the station\nI'll let you know I had fun and and in Europe the first time all that the first time I went to Europe in Nineteen fifty because I uh the second the first half of the contact we close with a train and I found\nOne story that stream remembered about how you do work together came from a time when they were working on a piece to premier at the great South Bay festival in Long Island but\nI was in New York and it was oh I don't know where somewhere not out of California communicating code\nSaid we have to have this thing reading\nThat right Don thoughts on on on top and I found out while okay you know go I\nGo into these things blindly you know just go ahead so I wrote it and it was just amazing because uh\nI discovered that what I had written I hadn't been more or less um development of what he had written and I hadn't even know what he had written and it was just kind of a almost the same\nNow want to St Louis most\nThe far east with comic out some saxophone mind originally played by Johnny Hodges here did Sherman or\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nI think they're going to find the clarinet [noise] that was smarter fleet here by the jazz at Lincoln Center orchestra\nReally street rogue smarter before you moved to New York city\nDavid Hey do so that when ... was doing Pittsburgh he had an idealized conception of what New York and McAfee society wants Mike from reading the New Yorker and watching Hollywood movie\nAnd when he came to New York or he found it face to face a in Allentown his apartment and in Ellington ... beer and he'd sit right in it was like\nShe was finally home straight ... family and old friends said he always seemed like\nIt could clear duck and that means clear meaning homosexual\nI'd just like [noise]\nLike our place in Pittsburgh\nAnd he was African American\nAnd he was out of our does want to be an early twentieth century\nThat he would introduce themselves in Nineteen thirty five and say Hi I'm ... I'm homosexual\nBut what he did was never deny who she was never pretend to be anything other than who he was he was fiercely\nOf his sexual identity and he never hit trauma he never disguised\nHe never socialize and the company of so called beards fake girlfriends\nAccording to David age because tree harm was out of the closet you came at a cost\nSo he made the compromise to be true to his identity as a gay man but to sacrifice fame and\nYou don't want any attendant glory\nSo she worked quietly behind the scenes often anonymously for Duke Ellington largely so that\nHe could retain his independence and his pride in his identity as a gay man so I think of them is\nKind of hero it's just there's John you know Neal I was very honored to\nBe able to be featured\nPlaying the music industry on\nAnd it was a gas\nGiant you also have the amount of respect for the like really strict on land\nHe was openly gay TV I Know a shame about who he was just the identity you know at that time which you know people really homophobic really in those days you know so he had to kind of keep that in you know in the back burner I ... I heard except left when he drinks and they will come out a little more [laughter]\nWell I think all the pain and and everything that he wants to neutralize his soul to gave him all those those brilliant\nIdeas to right to be able to sit down and write stories about in their life because you can pretty much here in his lyrics especially love I used to visit all the very gay places that's what he was talking about you know his lifestyle I Would hope so\nJohnny says that even when he was growing up in the sixties and seventies being gay in black wasn't an issue\nI didn't choose to be you know gay that was just something that\nI've always\nBeen who I Am I I didn't even know what it was I just knew I was different although I have kids and everything like that you know we just like what we like you don't like to really be stigmatized we just\nBeing you know we just like well we like if you gave you straight that's just what it is you don't put people do for you know\nWhatever or whoever you like it ain't got nothing to do with our ... baby but in jazz there can be a lot of machismo\nTo time has just been unacceptable because\nWhy should you be ... knew gay why should you be playing jazz you know in some\nPeople's lives and I mean it's\nUsually from the creator\nPerson doesn't matter which insects right\n... might be\nAnd then the case of the street on you have to look beyond his personal life and recognizes ...\nHe was blessed with a known it was just so\nHigh level gift of creativity and his news will go on for ever and which it is still [noise]\n\nHe was Johnny O'Neal playing rendition of lush and jazz and my concern\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jazz Night in America", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "14"}
