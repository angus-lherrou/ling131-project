{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "To me basically they decided to trade to to steal the company from us they're there they they said we've decided that you guys need us more than we need you were going to take over what we're going to do is have all of your shareholders convert their stock into debt\nAnd you are welcome to work down their debt with credit of one penny per cup for every ... every ... maybe we can get it will take two years [noise]\nAt the end of the two years we'll negotiate your future employment so it wasn't a deal that was the steel\nLook this is the darkest of the dark of ours were were burning twenty five thousand dollars a week we're taking money we cannot ever pay back we have to go back to this farm we have no solution and so I turned to Samuel and I said listen Samuel just for the fun of it what would be the cheapest yogurt plant we could build\nSomewhere that would actually cover our capacity and he said you know I was thinking the same thing so he flipped on the dome light in the car pulls out his pet and we start designing a yogurt plant in the car in the car were driving\nIn this I'm driving he's designing\nWe got back to the house about\nThirty eleven at night he goes in to make yogurt I go into the mix she wakes up and she says I'm\nSo it's a deal signed it and I said no no no no that is not going to happen but we've got a much better idea um I left alone that night uh\nOver my office and the next morning at seven AM I was up at the SPA office in Concord New Hampshire the small business administration remember they they will guaranteed loans to businesses so they make it possible for banks to lend to high risk which we certainly were called the shareholders to a meeting in Boston the next night\nGot together with as many of them as I could had my mother in law on speaker phone and said here we are guys we've got the bank we got the SPA all we need is your hundred twenty five thousand and to make a long story short we got their money wow how much money that you raise all told including\nPaying off the debts two and a half million dollars and opened our new factory nine months later in London dairy where we are today\nWhen do you know that you are not sustainable and that things are are looking up we hit forty four\nMillion dollars in around Ninety five\nOr Ninety six week converted are small cubs Ninety seven we launched drink [noise] Ninety eight were Seventy eight million and sales Ninety nine were at a hundred million in sales are and that's when I began negotiating with done on a to have them come in\nYeah I mean at this point has been a long road right eighty three you start the company and you hit a hundred million sales by Ninety nine why what what was the reason why you decided to sell you know huge steak to to to to know\nSo the answer is that two hundred Ninety seven shareholders I mean some of these folks came in in Nineteen eighty four without children now they have kids going to college right and I mean they do need a return on investment I had no legal obligation but I felt a moral obligation to um [noise]\nYou know pay them back and Samuel also was ready to retire ... so my idea was I'll sell my company do you buy out all the shareholders and my partner but you leave me and control you know two years later that's the deal we sign\nHow much of what happened to you and your success is because of luck and how much because\nThe skill oh look counts for a lot I mean I was lucky to meet my incredible wife and her amazing mother I was lucky to meet Samuel I was we were lucky to find people who would lend us money despite how silly this was a\nSkill helps you know what made this possible with ... and his genius and his incredible skills okay without that superior recipe none of this could have happened where you and I wouldn't be talking to so of course skill cats but you know ... there's plenty of fantastic entrepreneurs who\nYou know fail who had wonderful skills but just didn't have good luck\nThis small little hippy like yogurt thing that you start to Nineteen eighty three um has made you very wealthy it's I mean first of all was that ever important to you did you did you always wants to become rich out of this\nAll I wanted was my mother and my mother in law to get their money back yeah [laughter] I could you not know look you know we began this interview by talking about my father and his failed business and all the tragedy that came of that with all the people in my community isn't\nYou know I I was never a believer that making money was the holy grail um you know I sit on many boards now I work with Wall Street ... and look I Know the best way to convince these guys to invest in organic and renewables is to show you can make a lot of money\nSo and that's basically we did I mean despite all the these obstacles that you you guys have ...\nYeah I I often joke that we had a wonderful company just know supply and demand for no one knew that there was such a thing as better yogurt and certainly no one who ... was a and yet it's interesting that my dad and my mom by the way in both cases or what I now realize I got from them was this\nBelief in myself that uh it didn't matter what was going to happen if if yogurt cups were leaking if uh uh\nStores weren't accepting a stiff competition was coming on if I couldn't meet payroll or you know there was always going to be away and I I I learned that from both of them\nAnd and your your mother in law she's still wrap sadly she just passed a couple of months ago I'm Sorry to hear I'm assuming that for a million dollars was in the end of very good investment\nShe did extremely well she uh she and I still kept secret side was\nShe passed it nearly Ninety seven and a I can tell you that ah the risk she took a with Tony Phillips probably winter\nFor greatest point surprised you know she and Meg used to always have this conversation and ... and make a begging pleading her mother not invested Doris always had this one line which she had ... decades which is maybe I'm a big girl I Know what I'm doing ... it's gonna work out or so and she was right Mm\nGary ... cofounder of Tony field yogurt by the way down so old Sony field to another company called like tell us one of the biggest dairy companies in the world

R.\nShannon Henry ... has been doing some digging [noise] I read that you have a poisonous plant garden [noise] you can't just walk into a garden and I say I would like twelve men drinks first pick your poison\nSpike the team or send them\nLike that you want to get away with it\nPoison someone anything on anyone and then clean come ... case somewhat that don't have an extradition treaty\nAn strain champs I lose our a crash course in vicious vegetation and\nIt sounds like people sitting down to a dinner party\nFor dinner [laughter] oh no\nIt's like a little more at your point [noise]\nThis experiment that was the nickname the poison squad by the local newspapers in which she got young male government employees\nClerks who had very little money and we're happy to get free meals and that was the sort of deal with the devil will give you three free meals a day beautifully cooked by our master chef and only using great ingredients\nBut half of you for giving periods of time are gonna have to also take capsules of the suspect compound of that particular test so you'll be having bar acts with every meal or\nBut you haven't formaldehyde with every meal with a poison dinner party group of young men to see how things are going to get it is really like that\nYou know it's interesting because one of the things the Washington Post at the Washington Post just love the story and they thought endless opportunities for entertaining their readers whether\nThey actually created like a fake holiday menu it's like turkey a little ...\nButter roll a little more acts but basically what happened was they created a kitchen and a dining room in the basement of the agriculture department you know the white table cloth and let her back shares of the deal was that they had to eat\nBreakfast lunch and dinner in this dining room and they were not allowed to eat anything anywhere else no\nGo out for a beer with friends know sneak a snack\nI'm not sure you would be able to persuade anyone today to do that right [laughter]\n[noise] so how did they get\nSome of them got really sick and it really depended on the compound with formaldehyde people were really throwing up so sex so fast that they just cancelled the test\nWith bore accent was more gradual they took very low doses and then they would ... the dose up and what they found was\nAt very low doses you know some of them were a little whiny but no one was really set\nBy the time he started hitting a medium does people at stomach upset said gee I said they had headaches sad bloated eating this cleanser on a daily basis was not working\nFor them so he came up with all these results I mean this really kind of remarkable science experiment to testing all these different foods how did the food industry respond\nThe food industry was really unhappy really unhappy the Pacific bore acts company this'll be a a term we use today fake news\nThey had their publicist assume a fake name and plant fake stories in newspapers across the country criticizing Wiley a and pretending that people were dying of food poisoning because ... was not around I mean you know it was really crazy\nWow there's some other sort of fascinating characters in the story that you tell one\nIs the writer Upton Sinclair who's Nineteen oh six novels a jungle was all about the appalling conditions in the stockyards of Chicago and he wanted to expose sort of how horrible the working conditions were in the slaughterhouses but\nIt's sort of had other unintended effect that\nPeople were sort of already starting to summer and then you get these really crazy descriptions of food processing and the jungle in which\nThey're poisoning rats and then they just chop up the rap bodies throw it into the meat and meat is rotting and molding and they scrape that often throw a little formaldehyde or a bar accent and blood is dripping everywhere there was just a firestorm of response\n[laughter] if you haven't made our listeners queasy up to tell you I can do better [laughter] when his book came out of course the Packers like this is fiction this section\nAnd a Doubleday page had sent a copy of it to Roosevelt Teddy Roosevelt who is the president and of course he was this can't be right so he said to the vets to get her team everyone is like this can't be right\nAnd they found that it was worse also and there's these horrible descriptions and their report of cows falling into the workers latrines and then just being dragged across the floor and you know chopped up after that and going off into whatever\nRoosevelt when he got this report used it to blackmail Congress the first made inspection act passed in June of Nineteen oh six\nAnd with that ... long fought for food and drug law\nWas passed right after that so the one who led to the momentum that finally pushed to the other over\nSo this sort of seems like ancient history now all of this to happen to a hundred years ago or so we have a whole regulatory system in place to monitor food safety most of our foods are labeled how safe is our food now\nIt's a lot safer than it was in the nineteenth century\nThere are labels and the government does consider this part of its business we've laid down a foundation which consumer protection\nIs part of the job of government which was not true in the nineteenth century so that's a huge deal so our food is safe or not as safe as it should be for all of the reasons and this to me was well made this story so applicable today\nIt's not as safe as it should be for all the reasons that it was not as safe as it should be in Nineteen oh six when we started ... out these regulations we compromise a lot with business and so there were tests everything there are actually materials\nThat have been used in cosmetics that have moved over to food but they've never been safety tested for food because they didn't kill anyone when they were used as in cosmetic formulas right even though we are now eating them that's exactly right one of the messages that if it's on your label it's been safety tested it hasn't necessarily been\nKind of like in some ways we are still living in Harvey wireless world\nI think we are I think we're smarter and better at it but we have not grown up as much as I think he would have hoped we have done\nWas the dissatisfied food regulator that you're probably century it would be dissatisfied today\nDeborah Blum directs the Knight Science journalism program at MIT and she's the author of the new book the poison slot\nPeople and talk with her\nAnd if you haven't asked we are talking about poison this hour\nWhich can turn up in a lot of unexpected places\nSo I was visiting a scientist who works on developing new varieties of lilies\nHe's a lily expert [noise]\n\nAs we were getting ready to leave he said hang on a minute I Want to show you something else I have growing in the corner over here man don't tell anyone about this I don't want my boss to know that I have one of the [noise]\nThat he had was circulating among students on campus [noise]\nAnd so students were telling him\nWe're growing areas rock slum coca which is the plastic cocaine comes from the south American try it would be very hard to grow\nThe traditional Bolivian way to consume\nCoca leaves is to chew on it\nFor this guy was immediately suspicious and said I don't think that's what you have I don't see that growing in a dorm room\nAnd I'm worried about what your kids are doing that\nBut it took them a long time to get anyone to trust him enough\nTo bring him a specimen at the plant\nAnd sure enough it was not air fried coca\nAnd I don't remember the name of the plant but it was quite deadly it was quite toxic\nAnd if you cheat on enough of those leaves your throat with close up and\nYou wouldn't be able to breathe and you'd have to go to the hospital\nSo that's what he had and that's what got me thinking about\nHow easily it is for people to be misled or food [noise]\nI go on a walk through a gardener on a hike with someone and they'll be like a very often Bush and go here try this and I'm always like\nTo pick your poison

T.\nNeil Armstrong's mission to the moon made him a legend of it can be calm in the collective imagination poker face almost marble steps hero to people like his kids he was just that you know people in the neighborhood he was the guy down the street director\nIt's a pretty gruesome way to die isn't\nIt terrific actually TDY on films they don't have to do that because she wants TV poisoning people take a whole foods\nLike choked it and that that almost all and second and I know how it happened in the fall and ... cases poisoning takes depending on the poison but most cases poisoning takes hours and it is an agonizing she as it is very upsetting can shined\nWhich brings me to actually one of the things that always makes me a little uneasy reading especially Christie's novels she usually uses poisons that people can get hold of sometimes that they could just grew up themselves say from plants growing in the garden mhm I used to read them and think I don't think you should be letting people know this\nHas anybody ever actually copied her murders and the real world\nThere are huge example when I have happened that was a case in wrong wet and then for reasons I don't know he took a strong dislikes that a woman who is a great friend of his own cold\nAnd so he had the chicken devious coy to get rid of that he added a pain to a bottle of wine and gave the wind to his uncle is a gift known his uncle very rarely if ever drank wine so he thought his uncle at least I thought\nThat should occasion when the friend comes around all over the line and a woman will die\n[noise] unfortunately the uncle said the ... Christmas Day oh no he and his wife drank it ... they hate going\nNo vehicle was quite old people put it down to natural causes but when they went around to the uncle town to kind of Clara compare things without hearing all go to the wind on the table\nAnd you know for all I like what why so they toasted the uncle and these people got sick because while this was the best of luck but it was something sinister going wrong and they went around this guy last night that she slept president and they found an Agatha Christie book\nAnd the book just happen to pull open at the page without tripping poisoning in it and he was convicted\nOh my gosh [laughter] slippers murder through literary influence\nAs I Would point out to anyone who's thinking if anything the U.S and British in the metro in ways that sounds out so any time she is very good guys\nThe ones that scared me most were the ones that anybody can concoct with ordinary household ingredients wasn't\nThere one poisoning with nicotine and in the murder and made it by smoking cigarettes in water I had no idea you could do that\nYet it terrify people used to use nicotine they should make that kind of cigarette ...\nGrew and use it a thought on that raises [noise] and uh the one on coach in that case the man who kept his nicotine broom and oat bran people who\nYou can see what I was going so he goes to ... to have they cross the ... a brand Dave whole dinner and of course he picks up global so\nAnd he knew instantly he drunk so muscle and he ran back to his house he opened up the fridge and he tried to drink milk to counteract the effects\nDid it work no he was dead before he could raise the health trends that\nWow in some of those classic murder mysteries\nI remember detectives referring to poison as a woman's weapon and with some contempt like if you're a man you're going to stand up straight and bludgeon somebody to death but a woman will sneak or it can be your dessert while smiling in your face\nIt complete rubbish and um the ... something along the line all they're all ten times as many nail nudge artists that are all female\nMeasures [noise] yeah winning use poison more from the men but intends to show the numbers that all mole nail poisonous thing though ...\nAnd women still you up on the wall and then they use poison ... fortunately it it just amazes me that question is a woman as a weapon crochet um which you mentioned she was Robert ... about the whole thing I actually had a fifty fifty\n[laughter] equal opportunity boys [laughter]\nSee I think that\nThere's more in that stereotype the fact that we associate poisoning with the kind of sneaking this and that we also feel contempt for it in some way yeah if you think on a a larger societal scale at least in the west it seems like\nPoisoning your political opponents is a no go that's considered unethical but why\nIt does seem to be an extra special category of poisonous ... of the whole trial very basic pointed\nTo poison someone you have to think about it you have to ... you have to administer and I thought that it takes a long time for people to die not his last chance the time he ... click\nOn what you're doing and to change your mind so I think this is something to you and I've gotten gall\nIs an extra special kind of\n... that we associate with ... one of the kind of making it no sap play when you sneak something someone ... pay she brandish a night in front of them they haven't changed he said the ... and defend themselves that trip that I think made it\nI thought often play as well ... try history poison thing called out but especially coal punishment and they all know average much huh so\nIt's not an ... type of ... ... in Iraq on all\nI remember reading that Alexander Litvinenko the dissident Russian spy who was killed was radioactive T pulled on him to ten he told the New York times like two years before he was assassinated\nThat in the Russian foreign service poison was seen as just another weapon like a gun what's the difference between bullets and poison\nAnd you're right there in that to her and one guy regardless I may be a change the poisoning and somehow make a whole whole than taking another thought maybe when the ones that aren't all we should say pointing a just I don't know what\nDoes it seem like poisons are evolving are being developed I've noticed that the new string of political assassinations it's all with nerve agents or radioactive elements whatever happened to old fashioned cyanide\nI have a wife and I just have so much changed\nAny quite today compared to the sound of chalk a\nPlant you can touch it it said hot and very tiny amount ... that can kill someone if they likewise when the points I Can't I mean he liked his jaw skin and that kind of chill so intense quantitative makes\nTransformed ... at all and\nI was assuming that the Russians are using poison to kill and these dramatic poisons to deliver a message\nYou can't escape it no matter where you go you will find you and not only find you will get physically really close to you will be watching you will know the patterns of your behavior\nMhm you don't know whether they poison ... on on do handle or any or whatever\nPlaced it creeping kind of thing that they can they do very well thanks\n\nCatherine heart up as a chemist and writer and author of a is for arsenic\nWe tracked her down in Valencia, Spain where she is currently investigating another classic literary Poizner\nComing up one of the most famous poisoning stories and America is not quite\nYou know for human
