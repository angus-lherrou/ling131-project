the sale of all three other businesses over a year now\nChanged the name as a public company from Oprah bump into an era and off we're at and back then you could have bought our stock for three and a half four dollars a share\nWhy didn't you tell me why didn't you call me then run you know a guy I was telling everybody nobody wanted to listen\nThree bucks to share and ended up selling for\nThree hundred and Fifteen to share my God the truth is nothing's prove until it's done a\nShow you you are taking a risk and Ninety nine when you sell on ... by two thousand three\nPairs doing a billion dollars in sales are you doing a victory lap are you like high fiving people and saying see I told you\nGuy I never do of history left the reality is very sick time to worry about tomorrow is today my job's discover what's gonna happen tomorrow I have what's called the retailers nightmare I have a fear that that somehow some way nobody's going to show up tomorrow and\nThen we'll you know I get up on stage right and I I speak in front of\nFive thousand ... yeah and I I sit there and I think to myself as I'm speaking my God these people are counting on us to make the right decision yeah their mortgages their kids' education their livelihoods their lives their careers are counting on us to make the right decisions\nSo I'm continually asking myself where are we going to be in three and five years what do we need to do to get there how do we make sure we don't make a mistake\nHow do we care for this how do we stored it in the right\nWay what's interesting to me is that this growth of just explosive and early to thousands and I guess by two thousand nine ... opening like a news story every five days a basically every three days and it's insane middle of the worst financial crisis how\nDid that happen I mean how did that that ... with a financial crisis and the class economy not affect you guys\nAre whole view was to make smart bats and one of those smart that comes from a contrarian prospective pre recession pre the great recession the whole\nWorld was was in a go go kind of contact you know everybody was left bring up their balance sheets putting on debt borrowing\nMoney to buy back stock grow grow grow at that time we held back real estate costs were high we didn't let her up when the recession hit as Warren Buffett put it that's the time you make a fortune\nOur concept was still strong people were still visiting us\nWe decided to invest in our resources and growing even more quickly during the recession real estate costs were down twenty percent construction costs were down ... percent simultaneously most of our competitors are ripping costs out of there being out trying to chase their costs\nDown as their sales were descending it was a vicious cycle we said this is the time to build competitive advantage and ultimately we tripled to stop the recession [noise]\nSo last year ... sold was a choir so to a a German company J be holding Silicon Valley private company again um why didn't you sound\nReal simple because what had allowed us to have this powerful success was these ability to make\nLong term transformative smart but the reality is in the public marketplaces I was deeply worried we would not be able to continue to do that you were on Wall street to answering the wall street you could not do that you know I you know what the truth is I probably could cause I voted Seventeen percent of the star and I had this reputation there's credibility\nThe problem was what happened if I wasn't there yeah I see and I'm sixty four I'm not going to be here forever yeah how does ... continue to do the things that are created value\nThere is a pervasive sense of short term is that his invaded our markets the reality is when you have such short term pressure on our CEOs they react\nAnd what that ends up meaning is cost cutting and they avoid the kind of transformative event that you wrote the success of an era anything of value when you have a hundred thousand employees as we do and you have as many stories as we do takes time takes years and so the reality is as a CEO is a leader\nI've got to figure out where the world is going I got to know how the world is unfolding and I got to make sure my company's position as the world's arrives there can't do that so easily in a public company\nYou a toward the end of twenty Seventeen you you announced that you are stepping down as the c._e._o.\nUm are you finally now that you are kind of slowing down stepped out from the day to day stuff able to enjoy and you also

[noise]\n[noise] oh\nI was waiting for something to happen that never happened which was the white people bring up\nSlavery or at least to talk about how Henderson was conceived they never brought up slavery I\nI I was like well wonder why people ever bring up century other than to be sorry that have happened to someone else I think\nTo bring of slavery in the context of their family to somehow connect their ability to have a formal education or the life that they do\nI still don't know if they made the connection between who they are and how they became who they are the wealth that was afforded them be opportunities I think one is too painful too it's too embarrassing\nAnd it feels so so distant but I wouldn't have my last name word not for slave right and so I\nI never expected them to to bring it up and in the first meeting I wasn't sure how ready I was\nSo two days ago just two days ago I called John are getting up on the phone you're having an we only talked for like ten minutes but I'm a little snippet of the conversation ... sure\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] good morning harkens floor is John\nJohn this is Charles from Tibet for knowledge how are you sir okay are you ready to chit chat about a family history I Am indeed you met your gi relatives that were descendants of Henderson gee how does it feel to meet him\nIt was just a wonderful coming together beautiful people and um [noise] I had only heard a few months earlier of Ender's\nYou analogy seemed to have connected and you have such a powerful history together have you ever thought about what it'd be like if you had switched places I mean what if you are the descendant of Henderson and he was at the center of Robert ... have you ever consider that\nI Would be a very angry per se\nWhy do you think you'd be angry\nThe injustice of it all\nI'm looking at the pictures amazing photographs of Robert your gi descendent of Henderson Alex is G to send it\nAnd look at these two photos and I can't help but just to see pain in American history and privilege when you look at these photographs now how do you see these two photographs\nI see more of the commonalities than than the distinction I don't own the surface the\nBlack quite as the irreparable cash when Alex and I sit down and we spent the whole day together [noise]\nI found more commonality in\nA situation where people are not able to deal with each other\nAlex Reverend gee what about you do feel commonality of looking at those photographs you must be in a moment\nDriving back in the car maybe when you're like oh\nI Wonder what it would have been like if I was in the Senate and the other brother of the white brother is still a gene did you even think about\nThat mhm I often think that if my accomplishments I'm a published author things I've started created a nonprofit created the movement if I were white doing what I'm doing I'd be a hero ... and so yeah I think that if I were our elder great great great grandson given some of the resources that they were given\nTheir days are think man I could be a U.S senator ... today I can be the president of the university and then I'll flip in sync I'm only fifty four\nAnd I'm interested in great great grandson and I can still do that stuff and not attributed to being white privilege ... I've got something inside me that's allow me to catch up my daughter's a premium and the nurse told us to sort of watch because previous always feel the need to catch up like they know that their development has delayed but there's an eternal mechanism\nThat just makes them just want to catch up crawl walk et cetera et cetera I feel like a cultural ... like something inside me just looked around and said\nYou know what I got to be the faster they got to be the strongest I've got to show that what people think about me or people who looked like me is not true and I feel like sitting at Johns table that pre me pause since it\nYou know what maybe I've caught up caught up\nBut to sit there was a black man and field like I don't have to play catch up was redemptive that was worth the answer to dot com free that was worst lights down to New Orleans but to sit there and say oh I left that meeting in that space feeling\nHe left behind two of his daughters and Sally Hemings who was the companion to these girls\nThey were all children basically Sally Hemings is only a few years older at this time than these girls during the time that Jefferson is they are the younger daughter dies and Jefferson at this point is determined to have his other daughter brought to him but he asked for her to come over with\nHe says a careful negro a woman instead Jefferson sister in law who in this convoluted story was also Sally Hemings his half sister because Jefferson's wife and Sally Hemings were half sisters they had the same father James ... the same white father John Wales\nAnd they sent her over and Sally Hemings is fourteen at this time and ... the younger daughter is about nine so she is the sort of caretaker companion slashed to Polly and at some point during this time period Madison Hemings said his mother became\nMr Jefferson's concubine there's sort of interesting because everybody called him Mr Jefferson when they're speaking to other people\nAnd France was not free soil in the sense that you set foot in France and you were immediately free but everybody who petition for freedom in France had the partition granted so James and Sally Hemings could've remain there and they thought about doing it\nThis is fascinating though they are slaves back in Virginia in Virginia but in Paris presumably they just need to petition for their freedom and they could be free\nThat could be free people I think Jefferson was on the defensive about this because he does something that he continues later on but he pays them wages while they're there\nOne of the things I'll never know obviously but I'd like to know how they presented themselves because these are two people who might have been able to pass for white\nThey were they were light skinned light skinned people and they could well have presented themselves as just servants to Jeffrey some without this other\nOverlay of slavery so yes they could have had that Jefferson according to Madison Hemings wanted Sally Hemings to come back with him and promised her that she would have a nice life at Monticello and that\nTheir children would be freed when they were Twenty one\nAnd of course the other side of this is by the time they go back to America Sally Hemings was pregnant yes with Jefferson's child and she's sixteen years old mhm mhm which you're going to do I suppose if she stays in Paris I mean that would be pretty tough tough\nBut if you were there with James I know someone is actually working on a sort of alternative ... novel about Sally Hemings staying there\nOne of the things that could have happened is that she could have stayed there with Jefferson Secretary William short was anti slavery who remained in Paris and remained in Europe for a number of years you know she could have been made to him James could have been the cook for him [noise] yes it would have been tough but you know it could have been tough back at Monticello if he hadn't\nJefferson could have reneged on everything he could have died\nAt least according to Madison Hemings was on who later wrote on this I mean after talking with his mother Sally and James sort of extracted promises from Jefferson that they would be treated differently wacko back\nWas Sally certainly did that was the condition Madison Hemings said that that was a conditional which his mother came back\nShe would be treated well and her children would be free and so they come back to mount a cello\nThe sons are put under the to the edge of\nOne of her brothers John ... who is a master carpenter at Monticello and how many children did she have she had seven children but only for the live to adult which was sort of a thing that happened and we know Thomas Jefferson was the father of the way you know the father of all of them and that's what Madison Hemings says in Israel Gillette Jefferson says\nAnd then the DNA it's corroborating it's not a strict paternity test but when you look at anything it's a compilation of evidence it's not any one killer thing\nWhat do people say about Sally Hemings how do people describe ...\nWell they didn't say much most of the descriptions of or a physical descriptions people describe her as being very beautiful that was the thing that people fixated on one newspaper report when the scandal broke described her as someone said that she was industrious and orderly\nNow when you when you said the scandal broke so Jefferson ... political enemies effort like this and that finally may have liquid judge a person has the scandal on family mhm\nIt caused a real stir it sort of spread everywhere it didn't really affect Jefferson's career I mean in the sense that he was reelected resoundingly\nAnd maybe some people reacted that way 'cause it actually was not that uncommon no\nNo no she has certainly people in the south understood that this kind of thing happened and Jefferson had a reputation however of the sort of philosopher you know the stereotypes that people have well if you really intellectual you know you're not interested in in ... and sex I mean which is\nRidiculous but he did to three people were not proves people have sex and they had a different attitude about fix the Victorian age comes later these people were not Victorians but I think realistically people thought this is the south this is what happens when men are in control of women\n[noise] so how would you describe this relationship between our question is what were we use I mean you mentioned that yeah yeah their son Madison Hemings referred to his mother as Jefferson's cock you buy the word mistress has been used to describe or is there is in our appropriate word here well\nThe word cocky about actually went back and looked at legal cases white women refer were referred to as ... old copy mine was a person who lived with a man without being married period that's what it was and there are some cases when the men married the women so you can go from ... to being wife\nUm and we should point out the Jefferson's wife had died Oh yes yeah it was ... or any of this half\nYeah Jefferson's wife died in Seventeen eighty two and the Hemings women tell a story that when she was on her deathbed she asked Jefferson not to remarry the Hemings women said that she said she did not want another woman over her children\nThey said Jefferson agreed to that ... so she died he was thirty nine years old\nAnd he died when he was eighty three he never remarried that's a long time\nAnd apparently I mean this relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings went on for a long time for years and years\nIf the span of her childbearing is basically twenty or so you can only say that the definite time period where you know for a fact they're having sex but\nShe was his chamber maids until he died so he arranged their lives so that she was in it all the time basically for Thirty years\nThe Hemings family oral history talks about how he felt about her one of Madison's granddaughters said Mr Jefferson loved her dearly but he doesn't talk about how she felt about him because I mean that is the question a lot of people asked did they get all the time and there's no real way to know that answer to that\nI I mean is that even if it had a legitimate question to ask if we're talking about a master's slave relationship\nWell a lot of people think it's not an appropriate question to ask because it's not possible for that to be but I don't subscribe to that because human beings do all kinds of things that they shouldn't do [noise]\nYou know I might say I can list all the reasons why you shouldn't feel that way but that doesn't have anything to do with the way human beings live in the world I think that's largely a political judgment\nIs sort of after the fact political judgment about how uncomfortable we are with this idea Madison Hemings talks about them and the recollections he clearly is talking about them as if they are a family and that's kind of ... ... in a way\nSally and her children were treated very differently than the other slaves on Jefferson's plantation\nYes Madison Hemings says that they were happy growing up because they knew they were not going to be slaves all their lives\nWould eventually happen to the children the children who did survive into adulthood of Sally and top\nWell Beverly Beverly is a male and his sister Harriet those are the two oldest children they left Marcelo to live as white people they don't have freedom papers and you can see why they don't want them because\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black because they'd been in slave and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail ... we know about Madison it asked and and that's the thing about documents that important to them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson the\nRevered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality who's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean what\nWould we ... well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery and we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work\nFor no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution
