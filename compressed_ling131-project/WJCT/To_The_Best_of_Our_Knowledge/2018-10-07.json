was an amazing time\nAnd what was your position when he came back to your company I'm the same position I mean today was the founder which is the chief cheerleader we have fabulous people running the Madden um I wasn't a great CEO why weren't you a great deal\nYou know I'm just I'm not detail oriented and uh\nMy talents suited in other things you know yeah when did you when did you realize that you will not cut out to be ...\nWell what if the businesses small you can kind of be the c._e._o. yeah you know everybody so you know everybody you live and breathe that and then you could be a CEO because you touch everything [noise] but then a business you know once it business gets past a certain point you know it's impossible for someone like me to to do that job\nBut when you came back to the company ... in two thousand five I think within four years\nOr Steve Martin hit revenue of of over\nA billion dollars so so what happened in that time I had of the company grow what what was the strategy that allowed you to grow so much\nSo our goal is to\nYou know make great shoes and you know I think that that kind of like one out at the end of the day the marketing wasn't super fantastic it was just great shoes great prices great value and uh [noise] you know I think that we just war everybody out with that you know more people were giving us they're open to buy\nAnd we open more stores you know one thing in our Internet business exploded\nBut the big thing about the math I have to say and I've said this many times was the people it's the madness that I've hired so many great people\nIt starts with recognizing my own limitations I'm we get that so let me get somebody that can do that for me and ah\nYou know that's really the story it's people\nSee you ... you come back to the company and you uh find a way you had plenty of money at that point I mean you could've\nYou could've soldier shares locked away very rich man er and just kind of I don't know done something else

motivated you know let's say you've got you know a few dollars in the bank and you know that use the rent is paid and all of that\nUh so what keeps you going yeah it's a heavy question it really is but of course the luxury of the people with money have to be able to talk about this stuff\nYou know there's somebody out there that will listen to this [noise] you know they've got to pay their rent next friday and they'll say well listen to this idiot talking about it you know and I agree with them you know your in laws against human motivation right like half the money is\nThe money but but it's something I think about a great deal because\nI feel so good if I had that had a great day at work\nWe're I'm inspiring it and and inspired\nAt the same time it's such an amazing feeling there's

your success do you think is because of\nYour skill and intelligence hard work and how much of it is because of luck\nI think a lot of it as luck I Do I think\nBy own sort of philosophy is that the window of opportunity opens\nA for you several times in life for one and I think the intelligence\nComes from knowing when that window is open\nAnd you know being able to jump through that window because you could have all the talent in the world that sometimes the window is just not open\n[noise] besides the obviously the stuff that blend in prison [noise] um what are their mistakes that you made early in in the business that you would have done differently knowing what you know now\nLet me just say that the stakes can be a very good thing yeah [noise]\nUm [noise] you know so there were some mistakes we made but we just so many great things and the thing about that is if you start getting gun shy [noise] stop being afraid to make a mistake you'll never have the brilliant ideas you've never had the big ideas you know if you just try to hit the safe\nThe safe ones you know then you're you're doomed I feel like so you need to make mistakes I Need to make mistakes you need you need to goof\n'cause if you're not goofing a few times that means you're not reach\n[noise]\n[noise] the Madden founder Steve madam chooses\nThe company's market cap recently hit more than three billion

some bomb\nThe messages start when boys are little\nAnd they don't stop [noise] I'm answering champs and today I'm packing the costs and consequences masculine code [noise] compared to girls boys are more likely to be diagnosed with their behavior disorder drop out of school binge drink committed violent crime or kill themselves\nWho clearly something is not working for boys were men today let's talk about how to\nHe is very offensive towards women among some out I'll let you bring me blatantly so\nBut we're not attracted to you because genetically we are looking for a mate oh that women\nCould give me children and when we see that the mother will die or being as this goes out is not a good investment we will lose her\nAnd during the last presidential campaign he founded the Proud Boys\nAnd with all his prison give everyone a gun\nLegalized drugs and welfare close the borders on censorship very housewife for newer recognize the west is the best ideally number can shut down the\nThat can be Greivis industry will bring shame y'all want\nAnd we all want to want to get better boy when we got\nWe are called the Proud Boys so this was a comedian sounding a political group is it a political group\n[noise] they have chapters throughout the country you know San Francisco LA this is where all the Proud Boys are Seattle Tennessee Wisconsin Vermont there's also the Proud Boys girls not the Proud Boys girls\nIt's hard to family members there are they have closed Facebook groups for vetting potential members their public Facebook group has around twenty two thousand followers\nWhen they've been covered in the press recently which they have been a tiny bit usually people talk about them as possibly of white nationalist groups maybe white power group that's not exactly what you found\nIn any of the coverage that we did see about the Proud Boys the journalists were you know trying to suss out whether or not the Proud Boys were racist or whether they believe they were racist or not and none of them really brought up their views towards women\nAnd once I started interacting with them on line and watching Gavin McKenna says videos on YouTube I realize that there's this whole online culture of you to personalities conservatives appealing to millennials\nThey watched their Youtube videos all the time and that's where they get a lot of their ideas and they have been having this on line conversation for some time now it's now just that\nNow that Donald Trump is president it entered the public sphere so described for me with the Proud Boys believe and what they stand for\nWell it's a night club\nA lot of it does come from Gavin McGinnis so I figured I might as well go straight to the source\nIt's just a men's club what is the knights of Columbus about what are the ... lodge about water all mans groups or do I love meeting these guys once a month and going through our rituals and drinking beer and hanging out with them and I loved west fast where we all went to Vegas and shot guns and got drunk\nIt was like being with a bunch of Vikings and it was a blast that's why we do it because there's a real war on masculinity in this country that starts in kindergarten and goes all the way up to adulthood and it's not natural there's no big massive agenda there is no\nSecret tank secret ritual where there's a big plan to start winning or street there's no like our views on abortion or race or anything that there isn't a list of that there's no criteria there's no political criteria to get in all of that as being injected by the liberal media by fake news\nHe's really defensive right off the bat why is\nThis American Life did a story where they reported that one of the organizers of the unite the Right rally in Charlottesville was a proud boy Gavin making his claims that person was never a member of the Proud Boys and that the group disavowed all white nationalism or Nazis\nThe leftist wish Nazis everything might be racist everything might be white supremacy\nYou know I'm just asking what the group believes and then you went into what\nYou're not right because he's like oh you're from NPR and I know you're you have a liberal bent here and I'm a journalist what's your background I tend to spend\nA disproportionate amount of time of hurting the white power allegation [noise] okay well can you tell me what you are about\nYes it's nothing\nIt's just a men's club [noise]\nSo you went to me some of the local health wise\nI met them at a\nMe at a shopping mall on the outskirts of Milan yeah I Am at\nFirst I met Patrick which had it a little bit [laughter] here's friendly than Eric and Brad showed up\nOn one ...\nWe'll see how she behaves went straight to the bar is what are these two beers in the fries on my job I had already talk to Eric over face but\nHe's a Wisconsin chapter president Brad and I had had a brief phone conversation before in which he warned me not to even bring up the topic of white nationalism where the interview was over he and organic and it's nice to Wisconsin Public radio\nToo when you ask them how they got into the Proud Boys to begin with they all keep referencing Ghassan\nYeah I've heard of them are given on YouTube\nA couple of years ago they're very big fans of his I liked smart funny people I mean\nHe's that to the part of why I joined Proud Boys besides having somewhere a political views is I Love political back after drinking and uh I haven't run into any probably yet who can't hold their ground in an intellectual debate I from the Proud Boys\nJust by being a fan of shock jock radio growing up you know something I listen to little\nGrowing up and you know my time in the navy and the kind of got turned on the government can\nDo even show is something I was in the daily kind of getting ready for work and stuff you\nKnow with the emergence of the Proud Boys was kind of at first the ... for that show\nWere they wearing don't they probably have kind of a you know yeah they do what\nThey wear a Fred Perry polo shirt it's black with yellow trimming\nThat's their uniforms that's what they wear [noise]\nThey're big on rituals right I mean we should pause to mention this whole thing about the degrees\nYeah so I'm becoming a Proud Boys a multi step process the first one is declaring Europe proud boy insane I Am a proud western chauvinist who refuses to apologize for creating the modern world you have to say that out loud\nThe second degree is getting punched by other guys no less than five guys will you try to name five breakfast cereals [laughter]\nSo I mean adrenaline control it those were able to get punished by five guys and still managed to squeak of five cereals\nYeah you're you're probably okay\nYou can find there's a bunch of videos of a group of guys in a park they're punching him and you know he's saying ... yeah ... you know and trying to get it out and then afterwards they all hug name you know I'm proud of your boy patio of lying\nIn bed with\nAnother part of the second degree as this thing called no weighing swear you give up masturbation\nI'm not a wink or ... why uh I took advantage of right once a month for the way the government were to this this is my way of getting guys off the couch right\nAnd they should get out there and use that energy to meet women and start businesses\nThe third degree is getting a proud boy cat too\nOr is it is that the only way to serve degree I Can't\nRemember any way out of getting a test [laughter] oh no no and the fourth degree is getting in a\nFight on behalf of the cars a proud boy will get beat up for wearing a mask I had\nTo make America great again hat or there'll be at a rally and they'll get in a fight with someone and get beat up and you are an honorary fourth degree because you know we feel sorry for you to be that bad 'cause you're like oh\nYou know they seem really pissed off and irritated about woke culture and the PC culture that they feel like they have to apologize for being guys all the time mhm and so what the Proud Boys are about is not happy and apologize for being a man's man [noise]\nAnd they want to return to that\n[noise]\nWe politically if you had to nail on the spectrum I Would say Ninety five percent of his land on the new right in their social\nHe liberal fiscally conservative they don't really care if you're gay or anything like that\nBut they think the tradition as some value and has been you know we've thrown up the baby with the bathwater quite literally and uh you know even when they're letting their ovaries dry up for some stupid career in the logging [noise] how old are you\nTwenty nine\n... so you you're right there you're going to stop dating comedians and musicians and start thinking seriously about your mate [noise] yeah [noise] well\nIt seems like he makes a giant right turn right there he's talking about libertarian politics and suddenly he's asking you whether you're planning on having babies I think that's kind of his ammo\nYeah it's really confusing\nDid you did have this weird interaction was one of them told me that story\nYeah it was ever faced but yeah because this happened before I interviewed cabin about the story might not happen\nBecause most of the members of the Facebook group just [noise]\nYou know nobody wanted to talk nobody want to talk\nAnd Eric sent me a little blurb about what they're about\nThat he likes hanging out with other men in western values and [noise]\nYou know asked him if he would be interested in an interview and he said he would think about it [noise]\nThen um I think it was a Sunday Morning I looked at my Facebook messages and he had sent me a message late that friday night saying\nShould I bring the condoms because I Know when you hear the truth you're going to be ready [noise]\nIt showed that it eight am the next morning\nOh sorry about that I got a little rowdy last night [noise]\nI was irritated I felt like this guy's wasting my time he thinks this is a joke he's not\nTaking it seriously and I'm\nReading a lot of work for me that is\nActually this is exactly who they claimed to be\nSo why don't I just\nWhat are your members sent me a message on Facebook saying should I bring the content to our interview because I Know when you hear the true you're going to be ready that family value\nThat funny value [noise] if you're going to play with the big boys as a journalist you should have a sense of humor you can't be a\nChurch lady and simultaneously a feminist\nOh someone made a joke noun lady who don't offend me [noise] like women don't want to be equal to men they want to be treated special\nI just don't see that just seems like it conflicts lot with what you're saying and your theories about like ... when\nYou think bringing condoms was demeaning sexist thing to say you don't think it it\nWas a joke\nAnd why you mentioned earlier with Charlie giants for it\nYeah well he clearly figured out how you're going to frame it the way you're framing it right now do you think he literally wanted to know if you should bring prophylactic to the meeting\nNo so that's a joke\nSo is all of this uh Joe\nOr the Proud Boys the joke\nWhat is a joke and what's not is there anything that serious about it\nI think that the left is woefully ignorant of jokes when it suits them there's some meaning behind all this and there's a lot of humor and all of this like most guys stuff and I think for you to pretend that you can't isolate what's the joke and what isn't is disingenuous\nI guess I'm just trying to understand what you're saying\nIn relation to all the they're not you said about just\nA completely you're not trying to understand anything and you're trying to make this story fit your narrative and to do that you have to pretend that you don't get jokes and pretend that I'm inconsistent and pretend that I'm ignoring the looming Nazi threat and I think it's evidence that you're doing the wrong job\nSo we're back to your job again [laughter] what do you make is that um why can't you take a joke defense\nI'd interviewed an analyst for this story from the Southern Poverty Law Center has assessment of the Proud Boys and uh be All right and the all light in general\nIs that they use plausible deniability everything's like kind of a joke all the time so like just in case you have any critique of what they believe they can come back and say\nLook at our rituals look at the serial beatings and they can say basically that it's all a joke\nBut also this you know this is a pretty common defense you say something offensive and when somebody says wait a minute that's offensive then you say to show what's the matter with you kind of a way to cut people's feet out from under them if you know what I mean\nExactly and it's so ironic because they're constantly talking about it's free speech free speech is the free market of ideas why are you trying to restrict it and yet you're threatening me with a lawsuit if I even ask you about white nationalism in an interview\nAnd even asking Gavin making is what the Proud Boys represents elicits is defenses I see what you're doing left wing liberal fake news media and this anger\nCoupled with I don't think you should have this job I think you should stay home and be a mom right\nI Know that some of it is serious you know he seemed to had kids and became a dad and it sounds like when he became a father he really had to come to Jesus moment\nAnd now that's why I think a lot of his discussion around men and women in their late twenties early thirties is about you know you really need to settle down because like this is what life is really about\n\n\n[noise] the other thing that comes across pretty loud and clear is how embattled\nThey feel it's like they really feel sort of under siege that they're out of step with mainstream community and they sounded like they feel like they take risks saying what they really believe in public\nYeah and I think\nThere's some legitimacy to that you know Patrick tells the story is\nGoing to his neighbor's house\nI was wearing a make America great again hats are all hanging out drinking beers in the backyard neighbor wouldn't let him use the bathroom in our house and I laugh thinking they were joking and they were dead serious they now look at it as like a personal\nFront if you have a different political view I'm kind of appalled by 'cause I'm I'm so free speech more than anything they say that\nThey're targeted for their political\nBeliefs Eric has been docks where they post your address phone number your employer online\nThey never would tell you their last names right\nI Know their last names um but yeah they didn't want to go on the record with their last names\nThe first name basis that's exactly why because\nTo you know allow somebody to be\nA job that they work very hard to\nSomething that I don't want our side of things I don't want their site to face I don't ever want any more people going after people jobs that's so I'll never lose my job because of this but\nThey come across to me it just listening to this conversation as thoughtful caring really rational\nYeah like they felt OK about the whole evening\nThey were pretty drunk so we're good [laughter]\nI'm I'm happy I I think that we represented our side candidly honestly so run where every time I was like sure like you\nVery good looking intelligent\n\n\n[laughter]\n\nAnd actually I didn't know about the condoms comment I didn't bring it up during our interview 'cause I didn't know how Eric would react so Brad said\nYou know wow what an awful oh really\nYeah he did and I was like wow I'm really surprised to hear you say that free speech right and he was like yeah that tact am I right\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n...
