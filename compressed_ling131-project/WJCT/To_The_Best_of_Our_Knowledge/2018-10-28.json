regional buyer\nAnd he said when you are ready here's my cart he said give me a call let me know he said dot your eyes crush your T's I Will let you bring it into Colorado stores huh\nAnd that was just such a motivational moment for me I that I mean this is you know two years and and I'm questioning what I'm doing and why I'm doing it I'm tired I don't know what I'm doing and he says this and I think wow\nOh so what like a few months later you were you were ready to put ... percent of the world right\nYes finally have raised all the money we wanted to raise and found a manufacturing facility it was the fourth\nOne and how many bars did you have them make for the first big push the first launch they didn't make the bars we made the bars of how many did you make five hundred bars by hand so I had rules of packaging\nAnd vertical cutter mixture essential you in a bunch of friends and [noise]\nIt was me and my father and then any friend\nThat would help and and then what you would take those those bars like whole foods and then like sort of a table with with samples in and tried to to to sell them to people who are shopping store\nYes I have pictures of me doing all the demos and within two two weeks of being an whole foods because one of my friends who work there he said Laurie you have to go look at the movement chart upstairs and\nI said what he said\nLara part is the top five and one through five ... selling products in the entire store right now out cells olive oil and water\nYou as one of the five best selling products in that store within two weeks that's insane\nI knew in my heart and from all the feedback I've gotten that people were excited about what I was doing but I also on the other hand knew that there is going to be challenges and that was that\nI remember the day I got into the stores and I brought it after making those five hundred first by hand and I remember standing there and I was just I was excited exhilarated anxious scared to death I mean it was like putting a piece of art on the LA\nSo once you launch and whole foods and you realize that you're on the top five fellows in it's just that one whole foods in Denver right in that neighborhood Denver um how quickly did did a whole foods general you know the whole foods I Hope it's companies actually we want we want is to go national\nThat took a little time I mean it was over the next year that that started to happen that wasn't as easy as it seemed [noise]\nBut it but it did come together there was a journalist in Denver that works for the Denver Post and he wrote an article about me Memorial Day of two thousand three and it literally put my company on the map just from that one article\nAnd will always be grateful for that and from that the industry ... paper caught it and then all these stories from California started calling and so I started launching in California and it just started to build how are you making the bars fast enough\n[noise] we were doing anything and everything we ended up hill personally making them at that point I was my father started taking over manufacturing operations and then we started just getting help you\nTire people we oh yeah we had to hire people and we were really writing a great wave you you're you're already getting a lot of attention I mean we we were two years and we were basically a national brand now shall revenue and you're too I'm\nHere to I Want to say like five to seven million dollar yeah idea about five years yet we were jumping crazy gross yeah boy\n\nYou in two thousand eight and I guess I'm your approach\nOr starting and maybe even earlier than that you you start to get a ... big companies that were interested in talking to you yeah\nI I just wanted a little relief but yeah and um and then we started to talk to some of these companies and then I met with General Mills and\nI just knew the day I walked in that building and how they approached me and the meeting we had I knew I felt that there was a connection and the authenticity that if there were a company that\nWere big that they would be\nA great fit I felt like they understood my brand and respected it in all the brands they'd had been around forever so they're not just turning brands out putting them\nOn the shelf and getting rid of them I just felt this energy and so we've put a deal together and that was the day or a ... and\nThen all of a sudden I had to go from running the ship to realizing that a woman their team if people want it needed to come in and do that and I needed to let them do that as a result you know had a little boy I'm involved in his life like\nYou know I get to spend time pursuing other things important to me yeah and still keep my hand in the business and do the things that I Love for it but without all the stress yeah Laura how much\nOf of what happens to you is because of luck and how much because of of your skill\nI I mean I feel lucky that I have opportunity in my life and that have surrounded myself with people that care about me and that you know along\nThe way when people thought I was completely out of my mind for starting an energy bar company I remember thinking to myself\nYou know you need to surround yourself with people that believe in you it's really important and actually I remember thinking to myself I have more to lose if I don't find out than I Do if I Try this and it doesn't work\nAnd I'm so glad that\nFor whatever reason I had that in my mind because it can help me to move forward and make liver happen [noise]\nLot American founder of

[noise]\nBut I just what I consider to be empirical is much broader and much more robust than\nWhat a material is does a material is will only consider something\nPickled if he or she can reproduce it in a scientific method and for me something's empirical if it happens and\nI see no reason to lop off UFOs people report UFOs the UFOs or part of our empirical world and we know they are it's not a question\nThere was a story of the New York times last December about fighter jet pilots tracking them on radar and you could watch the radar for yourself there are UFOs now what they are we don't know that's a whole another question\nYou know there are there a couple of different theories about what's happening here I mean one is that they're actually spaceships alien ships that have flown from some other distant galaxy or planet and have entered into earth's atmosphere\nThere's sort of another way of interpreting these is that actually that's way too literal interpretation it's happening more at a psychic level\nYou can find evidence for both of those interpretations\nAnd what fascinates me about the UFO as it doesn't behave it violates both of those theories you can watch radar reports again on the New York times last December which suggest some kind of object flying in space\nBut you can also read your phone counters or abduction events\nIn which dead loved ones of pure and in which the UFOs essentially a soul\nKind of conscious plasma\nSo again I don't know what the correct interpretation is Steve that's not what I'm saying I'm saying that these phenomena happen they're real there are a part of our world\nThey clearly carry religious dimensions often not always and that we should be interested in that we should be fascinated by them and not be mocking people who express interest\nThey carry religious implications for what reason well\nThe gods of always come from the sky the guts of always come from the sky the heavens they've always been messing with human beings we've always been having sex with human beings there's always been grafting human beings a knowledge of technology or agriculture\nSomething and this is how these things behave in in the modern world they're weird beings that come out of the sky interact with human beings have sex with human beings grant them\nNew technologies warn them about nuclear warfare warn them about the environment I mean this is classic classic religious behavior and just because it's framed in\nModern techno garb kind of cold science fiction doesn't mean it's not religious it just means in speaking to us and the only frame we can hear [noise]\n\nTaint his ear boggled threshold shifted over the years I mean you sound a lot of this kind of an interview these are just too yeah yeah\nI Would say it has I'm more open to the possibility of some of these kinds of experiences and the intellectual place I've come to labs I've sort of\nBecome much more than even just willing but sort of like I sort of think there's a need to say we are now there's mystery out there we don't know maybe we can explain it but that doesn't mean it's not real to that's why you learn that the interviewing channel [laughter]\nI was intensely curious let's say So Paul ... who is one of the best known Chandler's a channel their means that he he says he is\nChanneling guide spirit guides from another world at sounds totally crazy I don't need to be telling you this I mean you've read Paul ... [laughter] I have read Paul ... channel tax\nSo what do you think when I read stuff like this I don't I don't bring the same expectations to it that I did live on that I read I don't know something in the New York times and honestly I Need to step because it how it makes me feel it makes me feel better\nI guess I don't think believe has anything to do with reality\nWow [laughter] to think about that um [noise] you are far from alone I mean because Paul sell like does workshops and talks all around the world and a lot of people have that experience and it came to Madison recently and we got a chance to talk\nI'm conscious channel I take dictation from guys that worked for a million actually dictate entire books through me that require no editing so I'm primarily known as a conscious channel am I also work\nAs an ... path which is a psychic ability I have this are they going to just step and other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio that's the way to look at me and who argue channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness than we are at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere was a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bringing ideas of lineage in history that I mean so is that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have different personality collective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what do they look like the one that I've seen but I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and I was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "28"}
