{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "This is fresh air\nOur film critic Justin Chang has a review of the new movie can you ever forgive me it's adapted from a memoir by Lee Israel in New York writer who in the early Nineteen nineties began forging litters attributed to literary luminaries including Dorothy Parker in Norfolk Howard and selling them to unsuspecting collectors\nMelissa McCarthy plays Israel in the movie which co stars Richard II grant and it's directed by Mary Elle Heller\nHere's justice review\nCan you ever forgive me it's a rare Jim a sweet movie about a mean person in which the sweetness and the meanness don't cancel each other out it reminds us that in the right hands a missing throat can make positively Julius company especially if she has the good fortune to be played by Melissa McCarthy\nAs Lee Israel a struggling biographer turned literary con artist McCarthy gets more expressive nuances out of an angry scowl than I thought any actor could manage\nWhen we first meet Lee in Nineteen Ninety One she's being fired from an office job for cursing and drinking leaving her unable to pay the rent on her cluttered Manhattan apartment or her cats medical bills\nHer writing career has stalled and her agent played by a snappy Jane Curtain tells her that no one is interested in her or the new family Bryce biography she's working on\nDesperate for money least sells off a framed thank you letter she wants to receive from Catherine Hepburn and learns that there is a real market for celebrity correspondence but this year the better\nAnd so begins her criminal career she uses her old school typewriter to forge letters by the likes of Dorothy Parker and living in Helmand then sells them to a used book stores for a few hundred bucks a pop\nThe movie's attention to process is fascinating we see her practicing Norfolk Howard signature and baking her letters in the oven sort of the paper will look yellow with age\nBut the real work isn't the writing and lead takes genuine pride in it channeling her flair for words into inspired feats of mimicry she becomes a fraud and an artist at the same time\nEvery Griffith their needs an accomplice and leaves as a man named Jack hawk played by a role and delicious Lee funny Richard II grant\nJak is a drifter with little money and no permanent address just some street smarts and plenty of hustle and he quickly latches onto Lee after running into her at a bar one evening\nLast time I saw you have [noise]\nWe were both presently some horrible cause I'm All right [noise]\nSlowly flooding Mac Timmy [noise] friends than\n... ... yeah [noise]\nShe ... she died she then she said she I'm\nMaybe she didn't die maybe she just moved back to the suburbs\nWho is confused as to [laughter]\nShe called my eyes that twins who have died in the [noise]\nI just come from having my teeth bleached\nOut he did give away [noise]\nTo buy buy you drink you know you are the pusher I think you\nCan you ever forgive me become among other things in a survey Valentine to nineties New York a world of bars and bookstores crammed with people who deploy the English language with devilish wit and style\nThe fact that Leon jak are both gay quietly underlines their status as outsiders\nAt one point lead has caught off guard by the gently romantic overtures of a bookseller nicely played by Dolly Wells and we see just how ill accustomed she is receiving human kindness much less responding unkind\nDespite the turned bleaker more downbeat territory can you ever forgive me feels like the movie Melissa McCarthy has been working toward her entire career as we've seen from her\nForman says in spy and bridesmaids she has always been a splendid comedian and the genius of mad capping proposition but the lows the dotted her uneven body of work have made it clear that even a dynamite actress needs a sharp script and a good director to soar\nShe gets both those things here the director is Mary Elle Heller who tackles this character portrait with the same clear ride touch that distinguished her twenty Fifteen filmmaking debut the diary of a teenage girl\nThe screenplay as by Nicole hall Centre an excellent director herself and Jeff witty they've written a terrific script about the rewards an ad in the east of being a writer\nYou might think that we Israel a professional crank Cooper first cats to people is a character only of critics could love\nBelieve cranking is is genuinely captivating in part because it's so uncompromising her talent as a writer goes hand in hand with the harsh jaundiced way she sees the world\nThe title can you ever forgive me which comes from one of those fake Dorothy Parker letters is clearly meant to be read sarcastically we Israel didn't need redemption she needed a chance to let her talent speak for itself even if it meant speaking through another writers mouth\nBut Israel got her due in two thousand eight six years before her death she wrote about her criminal misadventures in a book that the New York times hailed as pretty damn fabulous the same can be said of this movie\nJustin ... is a film critic at the LA

J. C. T. Jacksonville\nIn the U.S a third of all babies are born via ... section what's causing this high rate\nI'm Ira Flatow and this is science friday [noise]\nThe world Health Organization says the C section rate should be around Fifteen Percent but the procedures are happening much more often this hour we'll look at a worldwide increase in C sections what are the decisions from patients to position is to hospitals leading to fewer natural childbirth\nAnd what do we know about the effects on the health of the baby and the mom plus there's the oil industry ready to take action on climate change Exxon Mobil says it's throwing money behind the U.S carbon tax but there is a catch\nDetails coming up after the break stay with us [noise]\nI'm now this doesn't spell extinction per se but it does show that there's been a drastic drastic decline and scientists have called this you know one of the most disturbing articles they've ever read\nThe other big a study that also came out looked at mammals specifically mammals that have gone extinct due to human activity um since humans have started walking the earth we've seen more than three hundred mammal species disappear\nBut what's unique about this study is they tried to quantify how unique these animals were not just the numbers about like how irreplaceable they are so as humid as mammal share a common ancestor they branched out on the tree of life and it turns out\nHumans have been suffering entire limbs off of the tree and in aggregate we've cost nature about two point five billion years worth of genetic final genetic diversity as they call it\nDidn't give me an example of one of those branches that was that we're sure\nUm had young writing in the Atlantic he gave the example of the pygmies law which is a trip threatened species\nOr it branched off from it's common ancestor about nine thousand years ago which makes it a very young a species and so a kind of a small twig on the tree\nOr animals like the ... which is the last survivor in its group and they branched off Seventy five million years ago so that means that if we were to lose those animals that's a thing that would take you know millions of years to regenerate in terms of diversity you know\nI get it oh let's move on there's a there's an ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo report we reported on that back in August when I first began so give us an update in what the status is now\nWorld outbreak is still out going there have been two hundred and twenty three cases in one hundred and forty four deaths according to the world Health Organization's latest report\nOr they met this week to determine whether or not this counts as a global health emergency this is a declaration that would mobilize\nMore international resources but it also has sort of tradeoffs 'cause company or countries will respond to that by\nImposing travel restrictions and quarantines which can make it harder to get supplies and so health officials have to be kind of careful about making these kinds of declarations on a declined to make it a global health emergency they made it a regional emergency and what's scary and just kind of unnerving about this outbreak is that it's occurring in an active war zone\nOh that makes it tougher to get in there and do something about it [noise] yeah there's a reason for hope then\nYeah this is actually one of the first\nAh live trials of a vaccine we now have an effective Ebola vaccine\nBut of course the ongoing conflict in the north people region of the Democratic Republic of Congo makes it harder to get health workers in the health workers have been attacked in the past and then they'd have to ask be escorted by armed personnel which in turn breeds distrust among the locals\nAnd there's you know a limitation of how many resources that are going in and so rather than using a blanket vaccination strategy they're doing what's called ring vaccinations where they crack infected individuals and then tried to vaccinate everybody around them the caretakers and family members to help sort of contained the virus in a more efficient way\n... thanks for taking time to be with us today\nLike west thanks for having it in the mirror fun is a staff reporter for vox now it's time to check in on the state of science\nWWE Louis how to break up with the ...\nLocal stories of national significance one year after Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico is struggling to rebuild itself in nearly every way including a small farming sector\nReporter Bobby Baskin traveled to Puerto Rico nine months after the hurricane struck to see how farmers were recovering after the storm made working the land all ... impossible and she joined us with that story now\nBobby basking as managing producer and reporter with living on earth welcome to science friday I think you you will go ... so what is it a local farming community like in Puerto Rico headed Hurricane Maria affected\nWell you know before the hurricane roughly eighty five percent of the food in Puerto Rico had to be imported and that of course made it really expensive about twenty percent more expensive than here in the U. S. and after the storm that number shut up to about Ninety five percent and part is food\nAnd the crops that they do grow on that things are most heavily damaged where things that made a good target for when you know so trees things like a coffee mango oranges that sort of thing\nUm crops that could hide underground so potatoes and carrots they did fairly well but then you had the um collapse of the infrastructure there so there were months and months without running water or electricity\nI went up to a farm in the mountains where the roads were literally impossible for two months so people had to have supplies airlifted in by helicopter I'm One of the people that I met there was a small scale farmer named ... Romano\nSocial renewing ... Ninety percent of our farm destroyed but it was really like a hundred percent because with the hurricane no one could come here to harvest\nWow so where do we stand now\nWell and now I mean they're trying to recover but uh you know infamously FEMA and the government were slow to respond so really volunteers started as a step to end up failing the gap\nWhen I was there there was a group of volunteers from an organization called el department delta made out of that stuff food department\nAnd they organized volunteers just on they sent a group of volunteers anywhere from you know half a dozen to twenty people will just descended on a farm for a week and they'll tent out you know the camp out in tents and they'll do anything to farmers need Donald Dell a fix fences plant crops we fix the roof\nAnd um it's that sort of a physical support that helps get a farm back up and running but the emotional support I think too is really\nA crucial to people and you know I did a a five part series on recovery uh on the island after the hurricane and I saw this over and over again you know the government didn't respond so people just you know neighbors and volunteers um you know turned to each other for help and um I think you're going to see more of that in the future\nWhy aren't there more local farmers in Puerto Rico that might help have a large local food source of this type of disaster were to happen again [noise]\nYeah good question I mean it's a you know it's a tropical island plenty of sunshine and rain it it didn't make any sense to me to begin with either but uh you could really trace it back to a U.S policies on that specifically operation ... shop\nWas initiated in the Nineteen forties and it was a series of tax incentives and access to us markets and things like that that discouraged at ... culture in favor of tourism and industrial agriculture so growing things like um coffee and sugarcane that can be exploited for profit\nOr you know and that's fine and dandy but people can eat sugar cane and coffee for dinner\nOr you do see some small farmers markets and things like that so they do exist but it's really a niche market right now\nIt gets a little bit of a lot of change could change all of that it could happen\nIf they had in mind here that have fights on I think that people do understand um you know that they need more as that you know for months after the storm and people are skipping meals and eating out of the ten can just to buy so there are certainly acutely aware of how vulnerable the food system is there and I think I'm going to do something\nThank you for taking time to be with us today Buffy basket managing producer and reporter with living on earth we're going to take a break and then look at the rising rate of C sections worldwide and here at home what are the causes in the jumping the procedures that you have one why did you have been what was your experience like\nCan share with us on our phone number four four seven to for eight to five five we'll be right back after this break\n'em I replied oh this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nBecause we can this American Life I'm pleased to present here on the Brooklyn Academy of music upper house day [noise]\nBut it's true stories like we always do this time turn into a musical turned to the opera also raise a\nNumber of years later my perfectly or even merits this week Saturday at one PM on eighty nine nine W.

[noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of C sections happening all over the world listened to this worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick\nWhat are the effects on mothers in babies and what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question\nFor your listeners is that your your partner to go see section what factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number a four four seven to for eight to five five you\nBut it traces back and forward to the years that followed sometimes in some cases decades that follow women who have had to Syrian deliveries are just more likely to have repeat to their end deliveries as your caller almost did a increasing the risk of life threatening complications\nThe other thing that's very interesting about V. back is that in units in hospital units labor and delivery units\nWhere the back is embraced where ... is something that devalued\nIt turns out that the primary ... delivery rate which has no direct relationship to be back because these are women who are having their first baby and by definition V. backs are not your first baby\nThose unit to have higher ... rates of even trying to have you back and supporting women and having ... have lower primary says area and delivery rates\nIt really speaks to this idea of the culture of unit and really valuing the safety of a vegetable delivery\nSo lots of lots of callers April for seven to four to five five let me get to some of the tweets because we have never had so many times before I let me choose out some interesting ones are\nCalling rights are three ... three kids the first was an emergency one but my concern now or my children did not receive the bacteria from the birth canal\nAnd I'm seeing possibly week microbiomes affecting their digestive health a colleague Tony what do you think about that [noise]\nYou know as Tony was uh talking about the culture the unit in the back I think the the additional things that are are is really important for\nFamilies to know when they're trying to make a decision is is the the value of spontaneous labor and there's this new physiology that I'm prepares the baby to be born actually um\nContributes to health later in life but that based on population based studies and the the travel of the babies through the debt to through the birth canal does see the baby with microbiomes so\nUm she's right that that that does contribute to long term health I mean I I'm ... ... it's it's a\nUm been worked on we've looked at different things to do to sort of do that with the baby after as soon as she a C. section but if you can do it just on naturally that that is better than the other thing is that babies born by C section tend to have more respiratory distress and\nParticularly if they don't have spontaneous labor so there's something about that spontaneous labor that contributes to the nurses geology and the health the baby\nAmongst later this is science friday from WNYC Studios are so many questions let's go back to the phones to Wendy in Portland, Oregon Hi Wendy\nHi thanks for taking my call giant\nSo I'm actually an obstetrician gynecologist\nBut I I'm working just in a hospital so I'm an obstetrics hospitalist and one of the things that I Do is uh just stay in the hospital to manage labor patients [noise] um so I think one of the ways the country\nAs we are spending is that um my type of job is becoming more and more popular\nSo that um there are just physicians that are managing labor and hopefully are allowing the back end allowing patients to labor as long as possibly safe\nUm I'm from Portland, Oregon and we have the second highest rate of attempted out of hospital birth and we have really the best um data from our birth certificates looking at transport back into the hospital and I guess my my concern is that when I hear\nYou know the uh when I hear people talking of\nThe the you know very important things that result from from having labor\nI have seen some attempts at labor that we really should have never been there and have really resulted in some catastrophic outcomes for both mom and baby\nSo I I ... I Love deliveries I think they're great um but I think there are some moms and some babies that needs needs he sections and we need to support that and well and you know really provide provide it when it's necessary undergoing\nReaction French for all this\nI couldn't agree more Syrian delivery is a life saving procedure and there are certainly a many women who should not undergo a ... delivery uh there's a number of different conditions that make that unsafe\nThe uh the important thing I think um to keep in mind is also that ah regarding the example of home births in the United states and sort of that being an extension of the health care system and promoting ... birth I'm\nWell home birth in many countries are is a safe option and as a way to promote factional birth we haven't quite figured that out in the United states or it is important in a health care system that promotes home birth to be able to make a really clear connection between home and hospital and when\n... certain threshold or reached than a patient needs to be moved from home to a hospital that's\nThe part that we haven't quite figured out here yet I'm and until we figure that out I think it's it's going to be challenging to really embrace that as an option to promote factional birth\nWe can try to mimic that as best as we can on in the hospital setting and certainly have patients stay at home I'm for as long as it's reasonable um but home birth is not yet something in the United states that we have a really great system on to some ...\nLet me we're gonna have to take a break lots more questions we're going to spend them another good ten minutes on this so we're going to talk with Kelly Kennedy and also turn a goal and our number ... seven to four to five five stay with us we'll be right back after this\nMy rep later this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nScience friday is supported by target\nDefending future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie calf or wherever upon caster found\nAnd by twenty three and me a personal genetic service designed to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash WNYC\nScience friday is supported by legal zoom dot com offering a network of independent attorneys in tax professionals who can provide the advice needed to get through the daily grind of owning a business more at legal zoom dot com slash friday and from the Gordon\nAnd Betty Moore foundation more information at more died or a face off\nOn face but it was triggered hordes of women breastfeeding their job on the next radio left the teenage girl breast feeding a goat now that over two billion people are posting things on faith [noise]\nSo what we can see what we can\nI have to protect you from ... vital humankind\nAnd all that I'm an ex radiolab Sunday at noon on eighty nine nine\nW.

[laughter] yeah\nWell that's the snake man may mean those are and he's published hundreds of papers naming over a thousand types of animals lizards snakes the occasional turtle um but a lot of scientists say he's turning out a lot of quantity but not so much quality so that he is flooding their field with these animal names based kind of on slippery like sloppy science\nSo how are you able to name a species without good science backing it up\nFor this was surprising a it turns out that ... they had this big rule book for naming animals but the main role is he pretty much have to yell ... uh it it doesn't matter if you got any science to back up your new animal declaration you just need to publish first you can even self publish if you want\nAnd so that's kinda what this episode is about in part is how scientists got into this mess and it's also of course about what happens with Travis and snake man we we went looking for the snake man here and you know the free got more complicated than we first thought it would be\nIt's a good story it's a real story oh yeah I I I went back and forth on anyway but he went out here in season to this is was this the scariest you've had the effect\nWas it the sketchy do have some life and death ah yeah but the stakes were not quite as high as in some other episodes but we definitely got their porch where we were very nervous feuding about turtles well\nHere's business or a ... co hosts been produced the undiscovered podcast alone with the anti mental and looks limb is a science friday producer thank you both for taking them to be with us today and if\nYou want to listen to the latest episode and all the rest of them they are on our website undiscovered podcast dot org undiscovered pod cast that or go wherever you get your your pocket thank you guys\nOne last thing before we go Microsoft cofounder and billionaire philanthropist Paul Allen passed away this weekend in two thousand and four he told us how he decides to spend his well\nI guess it's pretty obvious that the science and in space exploration of technology in general are really do my blood and I just want to just try to find things that are either need to be done should be done or where I can make a difference uh\nIn a significant way and those are the things I've been able to participate and have been very very rich\nPaul Allen leaving us this week at the age of sixty five\nCharles Bergquist is our director our senior producer Christopher Intagliata producers are lecture limb Christi Taylor and Katie Chandler where technical engineering help today from Sarah fish bringing all welcoming Kevin wolf onto the technical staff or our first time and of course we are active all week on Facebook Twitter Instagram all of a social media\nHave a smart speaker yeah you can ask and now to play science friday whenever you want so every day now is science friday and you can email us our address is high price\nAt science friday dot com and when you go to our website at science friday that can be done all kinds of\nGreat educational material up there all kinds of videos and great stuff\nFor teachers and their students I'm a replay do in New York [noise]\n\nScience friday's supported by the center for inquiry presenting skeptical inquiry magazine for medical ... to climate change denial skeptical Enquirer offers the latest in scientific skepticism learn more at Center for inquiry dot org slash skeptical in climber\nAnd by target present and future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pod cast or wherever podcaster found\nScience friday is supported by twenty three and me a personal genetic service designed to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash WNYC [noise]\nW.

for all the young makers out there\nYes a couple of things or one that has a rhythm and then one that makes the melody and there's super simple show us what would you go to my father wanted to be part of my music life 'cause I was kind of taken after my mom's family like being becoming a musician but he was insistent on\nBeing involved here like you gave me this record and it's like how to code the easy way let's\nSee [noise] I was like there's some good the sun this record for a\nLot of thoughts and dashes\nAnd did so exciting about Nineteen sixty two that yeah 'cause I got over it and how to play Morse code so actually that the battle so you have a Morse code of what you were into like electronics active and you were really kind of into ham radio too you know how to put everything yeah hands on the six you know and it was [noise]\nThree three people driving for that [laughter] no [laughter]\nNo I I I'm going to hang out with you guys afterwards [noise] so but he made this pocket radio this isn't the actual radio but I use this or to demo because it's a it\nWon't run out of battery wind wind ready to wind up radio and you have a little more you kind of have on and off here\n[noise] [noise] right [noise]\nSo I mean cool\nMachine right there I was never for\nYou don't need a fancy instruments\nAnd then this a microphone that you might just find a at a thrift store\nRight or a microphone along battery operated amplifier and great\nMelodies with feedback and Jimi Hendrix was famous for feedback regular [noise]\nSecond term in some of my [noise]\nYeah my my binary on and off as the switch here you know [laughter]\nThat's cool\nAt first you're from the audience on this side [noise]\nI don't know how you act ...\nWill tell you the kids is the best questions so the question is how does the beat no\nLike it has a brain right\nWho had had is in control how you react to it um\nYou know Dr ... which say that all of the machines that he created were his friends and it had kind of its own life and when you interacted with that you were kind of like with your friend and the uh the energy that you were putting into it was coming directly back to\nThat that's a really cool questioned um ...\nThat's an eternal question right there I mean I have to put that in my book okay let's see if you want to play the beat machine later I asked you that's a good idea\nYeah I just can't top that question but\nThank you so much first of all for your appreciation of sound and your peripheral vision of the spare to play with music I really appreciate thank you um [noise]\nAnd our interests and applying these kinds of things to therapy um especially as that goes for P. H. S. C. and chronically traumatized industries\nAbsolutely that's a great question I have\nAmazing answer for that one of my music heroes was Harold the roads it's a famous keyboard the roads piano before it became a fender roads Harold roads invented that electric piano to do therapy for the soldiers after the war\nHe was doing panels therapy at his home and then he realized it would be easier to put some kind of keyboard in his truck and take it to the person's home or wherever they were and that's how he invented this electric keyboard\nAnd this would be an amazing thing to actually kind of reinstate\nOccasionally I find a broken keyboard a book store and buy it and I have a dozen or so just waiting in the wings to give to people I Do I give them to people and I see somebody who is kind of wandering I Would just give them a keyboard to try to mess around with this thing\nThat's great and I'm just so great to have a geek like you're so\nUsed to go pick on the program I you know I'm usually the lonely geek but I'm very happy to have you on stage of the money market musician ultimate deep maker base in Los Angeles thank you so much for joining\nAfter\nThe break the social lives of visa answered even fighters from what it takes to be a queen\nThis is science friday from WNYC studio\nSenator Elizabeth Warren got in trouble for saying she had a Native American ancestry this week she said she did get a DNA test to prove it and got eight more trouble the lesson never say anything ever to anyone\n... will completely ignore that rule as we taught the author John Grisham without all kinds of mysteries and I figure out joined us for the news clips from NPR's Saturday morning at ten on eighty nine nine W.

S. for pollination by told you we have fifty feces so we it would be more sustainable potentially if we weren't moving the same species of bomb will be all over the u._s. for pollination so it'd be great if we get a ... new species\nBut one of the limitations of that it's hard for some species that you ... in the lab to make queens and so if we know how it works and we could control it\nMaybe we could develop new species for for pollination that are locals are not shipping them around and things like that\nI'm a replay of this is science friday from WNYC Studios is it true that you want to build a ... but\nWe do what does that bar for movies you know I think it's so incredible they feed one another um so and the behavior is really interesting it's very sort of intimate and social\nBut if we want to study what it is and the fear that influences development I we need a system developed where a B isn't delivering the food we need to be able to deliver the food\nAnd so the robot that we're trying to develop this something that would actually when I must have like a little arm I meant it could move around and it can dispense little bits of food to larvae to them on outside of the nest in vitro if we had a system like that we could do things like test um in in with large sample sizes\nHow toxic certain pesticides are or how certain types of plant pollens impact that the growth and health of bumble bee larvae so there are a lot of questions we can't answer right now because we don't have a nice sort of standardized delivery system\nInteresting for him and just just to wrap up do what's the practical use of understanding and said he would help us understand something what better\nWay to one of the lines of research that I've in my life is enforcing recently is looking how um the architecture of finesse influences the way that in the dance behave collectively and so\nOne of the things we find is that you know the way that the chamber's are organizing the tunnels organized actually influences how they um forage and they're forging behavior and\nI'm a recently I Am collaborated with some architect and social scientists who are also interested in this these ideas of how the built environment um influences teamwork and how humans work together\nUm and so it's interesting even though as we said earlier humans and ants have very different perceptions of the world um I was the ... you know they live in these dark environments and don't see much and humans are very attuned to light there are some similarities that we can draw between those and\nAn end system as it says more you can manipulate things and it just and and you can move and from one structure to another which is more difficult to do with people and so\nPotentially by using this more simple system you can um learn things about maybe how to design robots to work together and had the same space is for people to build better team Arkansas won\nOr who will stay tuned to be what happens follows water is an associate professor at UC Riverside and Noah ... woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nThank you thank you both\nAnd we have a video holler bumble bee research on our website at science friday dot com slash fumbled\nAfter the break we spend a third of our large sleeping well we hope we do because lose out on pressures views and it's bad news for your health but how much of that through your genes decide\nDrinking for their break or musical gifts for the ... money Marr\nElse who was\nLittle bonus la\nI it's friday from WNYC studio\nYou know\n\nScience friday is supported by target presenting feature at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects and championing in communities nationwide feature at heart available on apple pie and cast or wherever pine caster found\nAnd by twenty three and knee and personal genetic service designed to help people understand their DNA and more at twenty three and me dot com slash WNYC\nScience friday and supported by ... dot com offering a network of independent attorneys in tax professionals who can provide the advice needed to get through the daily grind owning a business more at ... dot com slash friday and from the garden\nAnd Betty Moore foundation more information at more died or\nUs Saudi ties would take a closer look here's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of your mouth controlled Jeanie Buss President Trump pitch the campaign trail and us mercenaries\nFor higher the M ward definitely worse in this case they were former soldiers hired to\nDo military operations combat targeted killings and for the military of a foreign power\nSaturday on weekend edition from NPR News Saturday morning at age in eighty nine nine W.
