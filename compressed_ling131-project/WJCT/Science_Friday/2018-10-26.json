T. your community your world\n\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Anthony ... Curtis a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine and now the author of a new biography of lead in the last years of his life is fairly big chapter of the end of his life literally became involved in\nA Tibetan Buddhism meditation a form of tai chi um did this coincide with him giving up a drugs and alcohol\n[noise] well you know there was those were elements in these kind of the spiritual quest on lose part\nWas something that really went back to the velvet underground um you know Lou told you know one person I interviewed that song by like White Heat which to the naked eye is about speed ah he told this person that the white light part was about a certain type of vision or\nA you know he always was trying different diets and you have different forms of a different types of disciplines to get him\nYou know kind of out of himself and maybe in connection to you to connect with something um higher mhm yeah what a redemption maybe was was one of the things he saw it so that was the latest manifestation of it and I think it took on you know once he gave up drugs\nUm [noise] you know I mean I think even heroin or something like heroin expresses that kind of spiritual yearning for transcendence but you know once you did give up drugs\nUm I think those you know the the tai chi and and Buddhism and all that stuff that came meditation became much more significant for him because he needed more ...\nYou know for all of us who love the work of artists who aren't necessarily like the nicest people in the world there oh it oh it always some reconciliation you have to ... be sooner feelings about\nHow how the person has behaved in the real world and the importance of their art and the value of their art so is that something you've had to come to some kind of reconciliation of with with Lou Reed as as a person in as an artist I'm\nOf course you know I think that um you know I think this is something that you know I think this is an issue very much in the culture right now\nYou know the sexual harassment of women yeah generally\nAnd I said oh so you know you're reading about some director who's doing just completely abominable thing cities you know young girls who were just trying to re actresses\nThey just think it All right so like so is it okay to go like the movie you know and I think that kind of thing comes up more and more now you know there's a you know you know Lou Reid's um [noise] you know of physical abuse of women you know that's not [noise]\nUm you know anything that you want to hear about or or you know but does that poison everything that he does [noise]\nYou know I I sort of struggle with this you know in my own life you know being raised Catholic ... there's this idea of um the near occasionally sin that not only are you supposed to avoid doing bad things but you're supposed to avoid situations in which you might do them\nAnd um you know you'd I Do feel you know in in\nEngaging certain characters in certain types of behaviors you know I don't know what I Would have done if my life is that way if I was a drug addict or I was out of control or I did those things again that's not to excuse them but\nIt does it it did it short circuits my ability to feel morally superior to it um I just I felt that the best strategy was simply to just describe it as honestly as I could and then you know people could ah go where they want to go with\n[noise] well I think she's in all the music is there something you'd like to enlist\nWow [laughter] are so many and I know I mean let's say you know it's it's a pretty intense interview let's end with rock and roll\nYou know I mean I I feel like that is loose statement about the ability of this music to um\nTo kind of hope you transcend the circumstances that year and and and show you a larger world and save your life and uh you know in certain ways I talked to my own life was saved by rock and roll and lose certainly felt about himself so I think that's all night

[noise]\nOur hosts move on to a a factor that's made the ... the weather terrible for some people hurricane new will made landfall in Mexico's Pacific ghosts last week and what was really interesting about this the last minute shift in intensity rise\nRate over the course of just two days we'll all went from a tropical depression to a category five hurricane that's we're talking from forty miles per hour winds to a hundred sixty miles per hour winds\nAnd and do we know how that or why that could happen so suddenly\nConditions were were just perfect for it it was going over an area with warm water and heat fuels hurricanes it was also in an area it's a lot of moisture and there wasn't a lot of wind shear when shares just when you've got wind that different different speeds at different altitudes and that kind of thinking really dissipate a storm\nAnd will it didn't encounter any of those any of that as it was built into a category five\nBut after that it did it actually went back down to a category three before it made landfall very\nQuickly also yes again that was a really quick change it's\nJust so there's this sort of a new pattern them for hurricanes to be expected\nIt's hard to say I think that it's part of the pattern of more hurricane intensity definitely so what was actually ... tense hurricane season to reach category four or five in the Pacific northeast it's the most\nAnd she's in that area has had ever on record so on it's it's definitely I mean ... researchers have warned that in a warming planet the hotter it gets the more intense ...\nAnd you know with all the water that these hurricanes Trump now maybe we need a new classification people have been talking about well you know the wind speed may not\nJust be adequate enough to describe\nI I completely and her reading it as a matter of fact most people who died hurricanes they die from freshwater flooding not from wind damage and category the categories just only really talks about wind damage so I think it is important to talk about flooding said Willa\nHas made landfall in from Mexico to Texas and apparently the moisture is going to be affecting the mid Atlantic states over this weekend we could be in for for his first nor'easter of the season and it's getting fuel for his hurricanes so it's just affecting in terms of precipitation a big chunk of us are going to\nGet out of here early today talking about talking about water we're learning more about what kind of life on Mars could support talking about ... ... are we talking about water there and\nIt's very exciting that letter there yeah so researchers when they\nFound liquid water on Mars they knew that water had to be really salty because Mars can get very very cold and in order for that might not freeze it must have a high salt concentration so they didn't really look at whether life might be be\nMight have an oxygen but a new study has done just that they said well if we have this very salty water is range of temperatures and ... these different pressures how much oxygen dissolved in that water would it be enough to support 'em microbes that could breathe that and he found it would be would have enough oxygen to support not only microbes that certain\nTypes of fungi ... on Mars while not not to tell you that much if not all organisms and researchers like ... it's very very simple it's ... it's probably one of the first animals to have all say like it's it's a great thing for researchers to look at and be like I Wonder if I could survive\nThere may be in those moons of Jupiter we find sponges that would be really amazing it's amazing it's always amazing have you so if we take you know the Bush would a senior editor of popular science and it's time to play a good thing bad thing [noise]\nBecause every story has a flipside\nIt's become a common sight on social media scrambling along and you see a post asking for donations to support some kind of medical treatment often because a person doesn't have insurance or they've exhausted their resources these crowd funding campaigns can raise a substantial amount of money\nBut are there ethical concerns\nJoining me now to talk about the good and bad of crowd funding medical treatment is Dr Ford vox he's medical director of the disorders of consciousness program\nAnd chair of the medical ethics committee happy shepherd center in Atlanta Georgia and coauthor of a short research later on medical crowd funding published this week in the journal of the American Medical Association and joins me by Skype welcome to science friday\nHey afternoon or good afternoon to these crowd funding campaigns can help bridge the gap financially for people facing expensive medical treatment but what what's the downside to this [noise]\nThat's right so the downside is what are people are going to be raising money for you know we certainly hope that it's true insurance gas which there are there are a lot there's a lot that insurance doesn't cover that maybe it should ah extra added cost and people are off work and important equipment and so forth\nBut what actually dangerous is what you're raising money for it might be something that's not happening face dangerous\nSome sketchy kinds of treatment or something like that\nThat's right and that's always focused on this paper we looked at five diverse different so called sketchy treatments out some of the most dangerous ones being stem cells implanted instant central nervous system people raising money to get this done\nNow than in Mexico why the China some procedures here in the United states as well in a variety of other things also that are not FDA approved potentially highly dangerous and people in their generosity are donating these campaigns because folks are desperate need of help out individuals that but not really realizing you could be causing us some real harm\nWho could be a how much how much money are we talking about here\nSo crowd funding and of itself is a there's a billion dollars has been raised so far on go on the alone\nAnd medical crowd funding is the single largest segment of that as far as the problematic campaigns I Can't say for sure because we just selected out of a representative sample of five to a snapshot of the activity\nWe found folks trying to raise about twenty seven million dollars for five of these shady street and that's a and they race is over six million dollars\nYou know some people would say what's what's the problem here these patients have a right to try and seek their own cures trying new treatments of others have not worked for them [noise]\nYou're right and that's kind of the libertarian point of view and and it does exist however uh this is a little bit different transaction then uh you have a point that out of your own like accounts were just your own close family or friends now third party is involved and potentially\nCausing harm to yourself and that ... that that is largely go from me but the other platforms as well and so they do now have an ethical duty and that transaction\nIs there any way to know if you see one down how to find out on your own whether this thing is worth crowd funding for you [noise]\nThey're not and there should be and that's part of their critic uh that we outline a we think that that's the duty of the sites or perhaps they'll try out some of these campaigns\nFor for them on up to humans are to interpret that uh they could have for example kind of a medical panel to look at it they could refer people certain key words to the appropriate\nInformation on the website or other reputable websites for example but you really have to be an educator consumer and that's part of what the danger of these campaigns as they represent people\nAre going around a kind of standard hospitals and clinics and physicians who are trying to help people and prevent them from harming access the treatments that they need balancing the evidence\nWhat we run out of time Oh thank you for making us an educated consumer Dr ... back to Iraq to forward vox chair of the medical ethics committee at the shepherd center in

I'm going to make sure you're protected that was such a signal to every one of the country that this is not about politics but he's not doing that\nWe've been speaking to democratic strategist and hosted he'll TV Jamal Simmons gym all I Know\nThat you need to get going so we will say goodbye to you now thank you very much for speaking with us and then Republican strategist Alice Stewart please a standby if you will because they want to bring in a loop William hunt too is a former FBI special agent\nAnd he now teaches in the criminal Justice Department at Radford University in Virginia a Mr ... thank you for joining us we have a suspect oh what are your initial thoughts now that some of the information is emerging about who this\nShow Oh thanks for having had early on and so I'm the first thing that law enforcement are going to want to do is secure the scene I'm you know is there any threats to live or they are already um leads that need to be covered and the one big question is are others involved\nA so once you secure research or you can get into this person's house business vehicles and really track these things down and see if there is other places all worth it to be\nHow do you think ah from your best guess and you don't have every chicken this investigation but how do you think investigators got to this suspect so quickly\n[noise] yeah it it varies in every case but there there's there's always going to be a lot of forensic evidence when you're involved when you're working on this many um bombed devices\nThe other thing that we see in cases like this um if there's any um video coverage of where the person may have dropped these packages off um sometimes you know the person gets caught him but it we've seen that in recent a bomb or bother tax\nWhat I'm getting some feedback on my cell phone so it's a little bit a little bit about some\nKind of many sorry we'll see if we can do something about that Mr hunt I Wonder if you when you think about whether or not this man was acting alone what else he said the look around his home what other clues do you look for to try and find out if he was a acting alone or if they're on these with him\nYeah that's so so the first thing you can do is when you get a search warrant you can get into his uh arbiters house you're going to secure all of the computer um evidence so what kind of email records are there what kind of computer records foods he who is associated with you and talking what you're able to check cell Saddam's\nAnything like that then you can start interviewing a neighbors friends associates someone they know something someone may have heard something someone may have seen something and then the real question is how much did they do and what are they involved so all of those things are happening right now probably simultaneously and\nThere's probably a decent chance that someone did do something in in a case like this\nOne kind of I'm Sorry oh what kind of clues from the packages themselves will investigators be looking for\n[noise] well I'm a couple of things I mean you you want to see the kind of component that we're using this sort of a device so that might lead I'm a\nInvestigators to the location where these things were purchased and so for example if you find out where these component to purchase you might have additional surveillance a video\nAnd perhaps this person was accompanied by someone when they went and purchase these parts that's a that's a ... a one example and then when you send all the arts off to the lab at Quantico FBI ... will likely do that again you may get additional forensics\nBigger print any sort of DNA those kinds of things could all be uncovered from these many many devices so there's really I'm a huge sort a source of\nBut it has to be called through by duster gators\nOnce again we're waiting for attorney general Jeff Sessions and a whole slate\nOf law enforcement officials from ATF from U.S Postal inspection service to speak at the Justice Department to both the arrest today of a fifty six year old man in Florida\nIn the in the mail bombings that have taken place over the past week I Wonder when you listen to them yourself a we're speaking with ... William hunt former FBI special agent I Wonder what you were going to be listening for in particular what what uh keys do you think there will be to this a news conference\nWell I I mean I think there are a couple of ... so so the first thing that I think I'm at a press ... good old ears is are there any other outstanding threat I mean there there could be other devices that we should we certainly hope they're\nNot ... to make sure that everything is safe so that's the first thing the other thing is I mean everyone's going to be wondering about a load of it I don't know that we're going to um have that information yet because it's at all I'm going back to ... but that's the big um\nUm piece of the puzzle here that people are are obviously on a ... to to find out ... and ... to see whether we get any clues with out of that sort of\nLuke William hunt former FBI special agents I Want to ask you one more question before I ask you a to hang tight or what your thoughts on the fact that these devices\nNever exploded not one of them does it is it assigned to you that this suspect was a bad bomb maker or that but you know he he didn't want them to explode\nWell um [noise] you know this is this is a completely uncommon ... and one thing that you see what this kind of thing it's just sort of jumped to sort of terrorize people um even if you have someone who's not capable\nOf actually creating a a a an active devices could explode\nA this is obviously a way to terrorize people are just sort of get back at the other side if there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I think that's that's um probably the the big I'm a motivation there\nOkay hang was hang with us if you can uh NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a lineup we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office has been particularly active\nWe have a we have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nAh we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service in somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderous row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time on stage at the Justice Department\nSo employees to participate in this announcement that a suspect is in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged today\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents in certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation proceeds\nThis is a law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\nAnd so I Want to thank FBI Director ray and his team all about law enforcement partners who are here ATF Secret Service postal inspectors Capitol police\nUh in New York City police department and the United states attorney Berman on the southern district of New York and us attorney for the southern district of Alabama already on a ...\nFederal state and local law enforcement officers from across this country responded immediately to the cause and contributed to this effort we are proud of each one of them\nI Want to read or write to defend it in this case is innocent until proven guilty\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further and agenda\nWe will find you we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and now director right or who's done an incredible job leading this effort over the last few days he will give us the details of today's important arrest Chris\nThis is the FBI Director Christopher Wray\nThe attorney general as confirmed we have a rest of the seas are say Iraq in connection with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing\nI may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive when I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest importance our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nBut by then I I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today\nA threat of this scope of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder and today's arrest is a testament to the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab\nIn Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work that requires great care and were incredibly grateful\nTo all those who helped us in that effort in getting those devices to our lab from around the country we can confirm that\nThirteen IDs were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprint from one of the envelope containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that\nFor the seas are saying there is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different\nIDs mailed in separate envelopes and sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and in Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation\nOf this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work I also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert\nEvery to try to keep the American people safe from harm and who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now\nAnd other packages on\nSo we need the help\nEveryone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got to help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please call us on our tip line that one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips dot FBI\nDot Gov no piece of information is too small every tip could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to save vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nOf protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans now I'd like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from the NYPD [noise]\n\nYou're listening to live news conference with the Justice Department from union weren't\n\nQuite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to commend and thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement partners in his effort including the attorney general's office and us attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives along with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorism task force\nThe J. T. T. S. for New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to ... O'Neill NYPD police command might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged in fire and my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger\nThis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do the wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad\nAre highly trained emergency service in it or intel bureau or kind of terrorism bureau\nOr patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset we would identify and arrest the person or people responsible for these acts\nWe can make that promise because of the confidence we have no ability to investigate it delivered a precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers ... people across our nation are safe but is director of race and that might be more packages out there so I went still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe\nI Want to thank them as the public eye contact the thirties with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time we've\nBeen you're listening to special coverage of the Justice Department press conference on NPR and\nSee you also to the media for broadcasting the photos the NYPD released\nWe've been listening to a press conference from the U.S Justice Department about the arrest of states are ... in the investigation into this suspicious packages mailed to prominent critics of President Trump you're listening to special coverage from NPR News\n... case the tea in Jacksonville, Florida are going to go back now to our to our science friday\nAnd then there's the ... which is dominated by Latin American countries and countries of um a French uh Francophone heritage and there's um the other countries are in the northern loss to the western buster which is mostly western countries of a a a Protestant or or Catholic Providence\nUh-huh sort of the countries in Asia in the middle east preferred to spare younger rather than an older characters to I was ... what is it was much less pronounced fair\nYes the the the general preference for sparing younger or older\nThose of them was much less pronounced in the case of the eastern ...\nAnd in Europe and North America they preferred to spare home\nOh um I mean that they they had um you know they're kind of more more or less that was the average ... and then in I'm In the southern cluster that's mostly the Latin American countries or they had a slightly higher um propensity to save the young\nNow I took this as it was quite fascinating and I know I had my own personal reasons for making the choices I made how can you tell what types of logic people are using to make these choices [noise]\nUm the different creation as it might go into this I mean the classic one is a a utilitarian as um as as we heard in that clip you played 'em and\nUh the analogy so utilitarian isn't as you know should I should be save as many lives as possible even if that means a committing to enact to an action like intervening and\nThere's also the until the trickle approach which is like do no harm um so ... that's those are the well known ones and uh\nWe've noticed for example like in different countries that are\nCultural factors and or an economic factors even that influence what decisions of people make 'em for example\nIn countries with a relatively high or economic inequality they have a relatively high a tendency of this would be higher a preference for saving high status individuals' was this little sets us individuals\n... you know you put that into your tests but in in in this scenario is they include income gender and physical characteristics\nDifferent ages and these are things that the current driverless cars can identify are there any\nAnd they're not going to be you know knowledgeable of all those different things when it comes to making a decision\nSo is that really a practical way to study\n\nIt depends on how to use it for um we do not really expect that we'll just take this data and build a model and and um you know plug it into the vehicle into vehicles and defeated almost vehicles\nUm what they want to do is understand what the public's reaction to it as one of his vehicle crash might be we want to understand um watch what fuels need to be a lead in order to include adopted this was one of those vehicles\nUm so yeah those those are the primary um the goals of this kind of see the conversation to provide the ground truth for a conversation about on this vehicle ethics\nI'll get you you must talk to everyday people when you you know you talk about your tests and and and your relatives and friends about getting a driverless car I mean our\nLet's just just between you and me\nAnd people want to get into a car where they don't have the option of protecting their own life they\nKnow that the car my shoe who's that they die instead of someone on the street are they going to want to buy that kind of car or get into one\n\nSo that that's actually what what the paper and are there any sixteen paper looked at which was um new people or people people genetic before to not by such a car a lovely and individually\nIt varies I mean it depends on uh sometimes sometimes age or um you know I'm or a familiarity with technology has been known to 'em and including as I've seen a few minutes the idea with the with the eye and\nTechnology um affects these decisions\nI Would think that the current juniors must be ... as you rightly pointed out there doing tests about this and they are thinking a lot about this topic\n\nYes ah the the industry as it was a suddenly considering this I mean you know I'm I'm mostly these\nAre what one of the heads of autonomous vehicles um automation says something back in uh in twenty sixteen about autonomous vehicles like that they might have to say the person in the vehicle if you can see the most of the vehicle but then there was a backlash against that\nSo um and then you know forward for example though um they they said oh the the two for Ford said that I'm One of the city of goals that it'll it'll ultimately have to come from a social consensus and um that that's kind of the conversation we hope to see here\nIt's not going to be a commercial someday we're we're the car companies are competing for your business by saying we'll put you first [laughter] ...\nYeah a ton of automakers might have different interests than say insurers and\nMom you know policymakers consumer advocacy groups now is the stakeholders with a and of course at the consumer is I mean the stakeholders with with different interests and they will have to have a conversation to come to a consensus about where to move and that that ... that a\nConsensus my conversation about a little different in different countries because of the different um\nString to the preferences for a long each of these dimensions\n... let me see if I get a quick phone call in lay in Tucson welcome to science friday\nEither quickly low yes go ahead\nOh am I on here you are go ahead okay\nAh I guess my question in these ethical consideration as in the survey or just in the in the practice itself that your guest is talking about if there was ever actual material consideration of just not doing it at all in other words or the surveys including a question do you think that\nTo just think about it actually is dropping this or not doing it at all and do the people that can serve the ethics of the whole thing really actually consider just dropping it and not doing it at all and I'm referring to self driving cars AI okay\nOkay yeah you think well maybe this is just a bad idea\nUm that\nI mean we think that that more knowledge is always good\nUm automatically when when self driving vehicles start to come on the market in greater numbers and maybe even done must vehicles without any minute will driving options as an issue of\nWhether people will actually take to these and for that to happen I mean ... even a difficult decision even around them to even that decision to undermine the even the decision to always never intervene those are still decisions that have to be made\nAnd and that's the way that ... that's a good place to that because we've run out of time in ... this is\nA topic we will pick up I Want to thank you so an for taking time to be with us today so and as soon as a as a research assistant with the MIT lab lab in Cambridge we're going to take a break in a take off with the original moment Neil Armstrong and the new film first man have

J. C. T.\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow [noise]\nPacket her science soccer on sale [noise]\nReal science like [noise] now I have\nIndeed did time for another episode of science goes to the movies and this week a time honored story of a man a plan and\nSpace exploration will uncovered but I don't think it'll be flurries and just for the sake of exploration\nI think the more the fact that it\nAllows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nHaven't been able to until now\nMm that Dr Ryan Gosling playing astronaut Neil Armstrong\nAnd the new movie first man he's talking about why he wants to be part of the Gemini missions astronaut crew which will later on down the lands ... the first human to send food and set foot on the surface of the moon and we've gathered a stellar panel of space nerds to talk about the film what they liked\nThe insides of spacecraft like the Gemini spacecraft looked kind of grimy and dirty and then I think they were really clean I think that was a directorial choice to to pick these things and look at the machines\nAre there so that those kind of a steady choices that he made but I think overall it's pretty accurate there's lists little bits and pieces that he missed\nFor sure I'm On I'm On a lot of space learns on line or are busy or uncovering all this stuff but um overall I think it's pretty accurate and what did you what do you think of Buzz Aldrin [laughter] is that a trick\nQuestion [laughter] I've I've known him for years so I have my own opinion but we're going to know you can\nSay for sure that this was an exaggerated depiction of puzzled with in in the late sixties I mean I don't think he would have said the things he said\nUh but that was a a a choice that kind of narrative choice from the writers um [noise] um so yeah there's not much to say obviously he was he was not like that but you know it's one of the story and then as you do you agree [noise]\nI think they did really good job especially with the interior and a window like details down to the window marking that they use for rendezvous and docking were there and I I really enjoyed that accuracy there was one sort of technical piece that jumped out to me as a mission designer\nWhen they actually did the translator injection burned they were pointed at the moon which means that they would have missed it because it takes three days to get there the moon's moving that whole time you really have to aim in front of the bike quite a bit but you it's like throwing the football in front of the receiver that's running\nAnd so that one when I I kind of trickled in the theater but I refrain from commenting for my fellow new movie goers there\nWell I you know just just to someone who watched it in real time what had happened that was the media that's how they portrayed it they never really showed you the exact trajectory they just showed you how this thing would you know circulate around the moon and come back [noise] um now let's go to Syracuse New York\nHi Mark welcome to science friday\nHigh I go ahead\nWell I remember distinctly watching the learning as an eleven year old and uh I think so excited or in the afternoon I watch a dilemma touchdown and bone in the morning like one in the morning the space walk as I recall was moved up a a a good number of hours\nSo it's a little like a I remember waking up I ate a little brother and my ... year old sister so popping out of the TV on my ... but they were able to have bragging rights for the rest of their life actually watch it but I I was wondering ... missing from the movie was a\nWhole show a a reason why a that was pushed up so much I mean I get some insight awful Neil Armstrong emotions are all\n... [laughter] I'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nAnd the reaction of ask so I'm a yeah from what I remember the moonwalk was pushed ahead 'cause the guys didn't want to wait you know but this was a small operational decision but uh I don't think it has to do with any kind of particular emotional issue they just moved to them and I were there at let's get this yeah let's get I think they were supposed to take a nap\nAnd if I remember correctly you know how important hardly sleep on the moon [laughter]\nWell you're oh you're all here all my guess space nerds of some kind and um what did it feel like to see that representation of landing from the astronaut side view mainly go you go to you\nFor tires on the other may see it was so funny I was like I knew I knew he was going to land we all know humans [laughter] but for some reason I was just like oh gosh where they are they going to make it [laughter] I was nervous I said\nYeah you know I ... I mean you know this is going to have him but you it was brilliantly portrayed I thought a really wonderfully done or you got a sense of what was happening um through all the jargon and why Armstrong moved ahead from this crater and what do you have to do and the truth\nI think it was a fairly accurate portrayal my understanding is there was somewhere between ten and twenty seconds worth of propellant left on the vehicle and actually touched down so I'm sure they were on the edge of the the ads and they were doing it um that are standing there weren't a saint but uh it was very well portrayed that there was a very high risk going over that Neal is executing\nYeah or if I remember correctly him falling all over all the years it was there was chaos going on back [laughter]\nUm which I think well you didn't see as much of because you were in the capsule that much time watching but they the coolness of Neil Armstrong during this whole thing you know hand guiding this down and you see the the\nFuel ticking down and he's not panicking and he's the aries finding his mind and he puts it down\nI mean it was it was they they captured that very well it was absolutely\nYeah I agree and and then the the first ... off the famous one small step now he ... he did not say one small step for a man\nHe said one small step for man you know isn't there has there been some controversy about what he really said\nAsked if yeah I mean for years yeah but I think we can uh say that you know I think that sentiment is more important than the proposition but yet we're not sure exactly what what he said I didn't see it because they were ...\nI think he said at some point afterward that he's a he was a man that was that was the intention was his pension and we look back at the space race this time when the nation and the Apollo ... landing the world\nWas United in one vision I remember all around and they show this in the film I cannot remember another moment since then the whole world was watching\nOne event together and it was this sort of a unifying experience I said\nYeah I absolutely I think people forget that they were actually you know a lot of Americans who might we're not as enthusiastic about the space program in the sixties but I think that one moment in July sixty nine I think there was a kind of a cultural consensus\nThis was one year after what I consider the most terrible year Nineteen sixty eight I ever have lived through so and then there was to have this kind of event that my body was sitting United together because the country was so divided over the war and feels a little bit like that now that's where the same feeling [laughter]\nWe're in and take a break and talk more about a space travel and talked with a\nWell my guess hear about it maybe if you saw the movie please let us know when I'm ready for for seven to for eight to five five you can also tweet us at ... will be\nRight back after this break stay with us [noise]\nUm I replied oh this is science friday from WNYC Studios\n\nScience friday's supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie cas or wherever upon caster found\nAnd by twenty three and me a personal genetic service designed to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and knee dot com slash WNYC\nScience friday and supported by legal zoom dot com offering a network of independent attorneys in tax professionals who can provide the advice needed to get through the daily grind of owning a business more at ... dot com slash friday and from the Gordon\nAnd Betty Moore foundation more information at more died or\nThe investigation continues into the suspicious packages ... critics President Trump will have the latest also Russian trolls try to influence American by weeding about football players who kneel during the anthem\nWhat their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord so if you're attempting to divide people this is a pretty great subject\nSaturday on weekend edition from NPR News Saturday morning at age an eighty nine nine W.
