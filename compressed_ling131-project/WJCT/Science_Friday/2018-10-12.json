C. L. U. is with me now to talk about efforts to protect and preserve the ecology\nThey're welcome to seal and we have good to be with you Ira so tell us about the ecological problems are a little bit of history this is nothing new right no it's it's really interesting it's sort of like CSI for ... because we had this whole\nChain reaction of things but uh you as you mentioned we had the ranchers moved in and they brought in cattle and sheep and pigs and other non native things to the islands but what happened was after World War two a lot of DDT ended up in the ocean the de de de ended up in fish now the reason this is significant is the bald eagles which are native to the islands eat these fish\nAnd it built up to the point in the bald eagles that whenever they would nest the eggs would crack so that would basically they would sit in the exit would crack and the bald eagles came to the point of extinction so they brought in the bald eagles PR captive breeding program\nSo that opens another door golden eagles which don't live in the islands naturally said hey this looks like a great place to live because our our nemesis has gone now so so golden eagles moved out into the islands [noise]\nThe golden eagles when they moved out there started to eat the feral pigs are out there and also this rare species of Fox it's called the island Fox it looks like a cat it's a tiny little Fox they're cute they're adorable looking\nAnd the island Fox very curious about people\nBut the island Fox doesn't have it in their DNA to be on the alert for the golden eagles so the golden eagles basically started feast on them push them to the point of extinction so you had this whole chain reaction\nBiologist looked at this and said okay we need to grab what a island Fox is we have left we need to bring them in for a captive breeding program to try to save them and so she had this whole cascade of events and so the biologist had to figure out how these things were in a related\nAnd they started to fix them and it's fascinating\nSo what what do you mean they they started to fix them so\nWhat happened was they they finally got enough of the bald eagles that they were able to reintroduce them to the islands than the golden eagles to move into the islands that did at trapping program they relocated them to another part of California and into into that as well and then the island Fox has had gotten to the point where they could release them onto the islands and and and they\nThey've they've just been growing at Jim ... who's a national park service biologist I'm I've talked to him for Twenty years about this project he said maybe in our lifetime we could see the island Fox recover\nIt happened in less than twenty or it's remarkable biologists around the world or win at this because humans were able to fix the problem but wait there's more there is more because it because there's other non native things out you know there's the eucalyptus trees and there's aunts specifically Argentinean ants which you find on Santa Cruz island\nThey went in and they said okay we're gonna desk for these ants were going to get rid of these ants but the problem is ... how do you know that you've gotten rid of all the ants\nOkay I'll throw it out for the I'm Sorry go ahead I'm a little cup about that\nThey're very very effective to the point that we cannot find any chance with us in our human abilities to over sixty thousand bars sweat a plant where we think we did a really good job on the treatment and bring out the stock to try to resolve to ensure that we can say okay we're done to their education\nNow that's Christina Bowser with the nature conservancy so what they did is\nA this group co working dogs for conservation in Montana train this dog specifically to find Argentine finance the only dog of its type in the world it went out it checked out the islands and it said that Santa Cruz island his aunt free in fact now twice I just checked up into buys he's now looking for quality muscles in place for national park\nAnd so he's moved on but that they were able to show that the island is now an free thanks to the dog\nSo we have a happy ending we do ... to the ... that's Roscoe as a news director here at K. C. L. U. in Thousand Oaks California\nWe're going to take a break and when we come back the countdown to the mid term the mid term elections is on and just a month out how secure our our ballot boxes we heard that there's been some new interference in the last election will see house more secure they might be stay with us be right back after this break\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nIn the jungles of El Salvador to voters launching drone [noise]\nThis is some foreign to lose if she could have gone\nShortage in their fins there we go\nAnd Mike who spend months sometimes\nUsed in the working under roof condition is\nSlavery as the mother next reveal Saturday at three PM on eighty nine nine W.

J. C. T.\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nIs less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference well it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems how does all of this affect voting behavior\nAnd our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to four to five five\nYou know you know and and in fact this pipe in here I mean I think that there's a there's a big general point on to what Larry is saying and and it's a point that's being made a lot\nThese days and the elections spaces that understand a lot of focus on how do we secure the various election systems whether it\nBe the machines of the er the voting registration systems there's off of the matter of building resilience into the system because we know that at\nSome time in some place things really to break down like you experienced or you know there'll be mistakes or there will in fact the attacks and so then the question is what what is the backup and was the backup plan and the case of if you have paper ballots\nUm although you might have electronic ballot marking devices that the backup if the voter registration system is down if you're prepared with I'm In a provisional ballots\nUm or even on a paper backup of on electronic voting system um then you can move ahead and um you know if if\nAnd those are the sorts of things where when I look at state and local officials\nNow that's what I Want to know about is what sort of resilience in an emergency planning is going into the operations just as much as I'm interested in well you know do you have the sensor on your servers do you have this sort of two factor authentication on your on your on your email et cetera\nLaurence ... is the Brennan Center more concerned about the voting system more of the possible suppression of the voting registration of candidates\n[noise] yeah I mean we're [laughter] we're about we're concerned about both for sure I I think and I think both of them um [noise] uh\nContribute to a to cynicism about the process too concerned about the process I I Do think you know we've seen 'em\nAn unusual number of a voter purges uh in the last couple of years since um\nSince the Shelby decision that struck down an important part of the voting rights act in states that were covered before and that had to get pre clearance for ... for for doing things like purging voters um we've seen a massive increase in states like Georgia\nAnd um and Texas and Florida and North Carolina and uh you know I I think when people see that that um people that legitimately should be entitled to vote and show up at the polls until they're not on the royals um for whatever reason and it could be because\nThere was there were mistakes programming errors or it could be because they were they were improperly purged hum that creates a lot of doubt in the integrity of the system one thing that I Would say that everybody\nOr in the run up to the election as they should be checking their voter registration that's an easy thing to do on line or if their opinion\nAnd they think they registered they may not\nYes absolutely and and in fact that's that's an early that can be an early warning sign for election officials that hey maybe I Need to figure out what's going on here maybe there's a problem so I think that's really important to do for the voter because it'll also remind them of where they should be going to vote and they can feel confident about when they show up on election day but I think it's also important for the system generally\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios uh Charles you looked at how the public sentiment towards election security when it feels if they think are voting systems are secure do day [noise]\nUm well actually um they they do for the most part I I did a um I did I did a survey I'm just over the weekend on last weekend which I'm I'm replicated something I did in may and I asked the representative\nSample of voters um potential voters um whether they're competent at least that there um that their own county or locality is prepared for um this November in\nTerms of computer hacking and about I'm sixty percent or so of the respondents said that they were\nAt least somewhat Tom confident in um what um what's likely to happen in November I'm with I'm not surprisingly\nMaybe Republicans of being a bit more confident the Democrats\nAnd um and that\nGot partisan divide by the way as one of the reasons why I always I'm kind of put an asterisk on any public opinion research being done on public attitudes about confidence and voting whether it be in cyber security or just\nThe vote count in general and that these days everything is partisan and um\nYou know voters expectations about what's going to happen in November and whether we're prepared on the cyber security side um\nIs as much um is is likely to be determined by their partisanship\nAs um attitudes about almost any other issue\nIs voting security politically partisan issue [noise]\nI'm a little bit um I mean it's surprisingly nonpartisan in the sense that I mean there are democratic and Republican differences on the cyber security front um but they are you know you know they're the sort that a political scientist would write home about but maybe\nOn everybody else would yawn at when you compare it to you know it attitudes about abortion or health care for instance um [noise] but um when you look at other survey research that I've done Democrats for instance are more likely to be concerned about flip on foreign attacks foreign influence on elections\nUm Republicans are more likely to be concerned about um internal um cyber security problems which is I I think consistent with Republican connections in general about um um fraud and\nOther things that happened domestically so there is you know they're all those kind of differences that are gonna reflective of the twenty sixteen election but nonetheless Republicans and Democrats alike are both concern about cyber security\nIn elections in both of them on a whole are confident that their local officials um are are are doing the right thing\nAnd been very interesting topic off taking up more and maybe even before the weeks before the elections and get an analysis when the elections are over I Want to thank both of my guests Lawrence Norden deputy director\nOf the Brennan Center is Democracy Program at

J. C. T.\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen hundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long on a clear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote will below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impact such as\nRising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages in and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point\nThe agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius\nBut how much does happen to Greece save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change vi PCC this week cash shed some light on that\nBut uh but you know we talked we talked about energy usage in the past uh it's it's it's cheaper to make things more efficient\nSo that it'll use up as much energy than it is mitigating the problem later is the same thing true of carbon it's it's better to keep it from being admitted it's much more efficient to do that than to try to suck it out of the year later\nThat's for sure absolutely certainly on reducing energy demand energy efficiency and these are all going to be critically important efficiency of industrial processes um and changing some of the behavioral changes that would lead to kind of more low carbon society would be very critical\n... to this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nI mentioned some of the uh the things we're watching now rising sea level and the levels we have more demonstrating floods and we had a hurricane that's now gone off the scale\nThis week I'm In for some measurements are we not seeing is it not fair to call these consequences of of climate change or evidence more or less of climate change\n[noise]\nAbsolutely I I I think what's important um and I think one of the reasons why I'm this report um is really hitting home to people is that everyone is seeing the um devastating impacts them just one degree of warming\nAnd now we're talking on with the current climate change commitments on even if they were fully implemented we're slated for two point seven to three point seven degrees Celsius of warming\nUm so that's a world that um we don't know what that looks like I'm certainly that that's better than without the climate change commitments but we are talking about a tremendous changes\nUm across systems on it certainly we have lots of evidence that um the impacts unfolding around us um have a human fingerprints are and we can see the impacts of human activity I'm In a number of different changes um including and storm activity um\nIn terms of the amount of time that storms are sticking around on in the Atlantic the the frequency on the intensity of storms on the sea level rise basically gives the higher on boarding for um coastal inundation um so we're definitely already seeing a lot of impacts on told\nHer I'm ounce of rainfall it's coming out of these [noise] that's right or is just an amazing buddies but you you scared me a little bit when you just said oh we don't even know what it would look like and it above two degrees Celsius and\nSo and so on what we do have is we have some models that um look at what the projected impacts would be and um for some of these impacts we have more certainty and\nFor others we have less certainty they are also these so called wild cards um\nThat probably are are low low probability on but what had very high impact and where those thresholds lie on for some of those we are not completely I sure so if you think about um shifting of ecosystems from a tropical forest to savannah like state or because you have such extreme drought\nUm that would be not only catastrophic for the ecosystem and by diversity and services but also for carbon for carbon storage\nYou know and but frequently struck by people who say you know if we take it's going to cost us money is going to cost taxpayers money to implement some of these things we're talking about but the other side of the argument never gets talked about it what you're going to cost\nTerms of lives in capital and movement of populations and farming if we don't do\nAny of these things it's just it's so totally unbalanced on the other side\nThat's absolutely right and interestingly the report found that economic losses are actually much greater as temperatures rise and with middle income countries in Africa Southeast Asia and India Brazil Mexico\nI'm projected to be affected the most and they looked at 'em global GDP losses for one point five versus two degrees and found that on it was significantly different on a lot of these losses sometimes aren't even in the calculations to begin with\nI and I'm certainly if you have short term is and where you don't value later on economic impacts as well as those that are harder to quantify um it doesn't get into the equation\n[noise] so um you know we'll just have to wait and see what happens I mean we because it's not a pretty picture the way we're not ... it's not a pretty\nPicture but there is there's a lot we can do and we must do I you know first time in terms of the international process governments and twenty twenty on are invited to up their commitments and to increase the ambition of their commitments and that's going to be really important\nOr what we know is the current commitments are not good enough to get us on track so I think on making sure that I there is an expectation and a pressure for governments to do that on\nBut I mean for for people not to throw up their hands on because there is an incredibly important role for everyone to play not on the government but the private sector and also individuals and I'm a lot of different things that on individuals can do for sure\nMost yeah that was why I think the biggest thinking individuals can do I I was\nGoing to say the single biggest thing is to get out and vote 'em because I think we need to um make sure that decision makers are taking climate change incredibly seriously and really turning their mission in factory around\nGet up there and vote thank you very much stuck to live and Dr

I have a couple of questions where one is the discovery of this all the salt making does it change your ideas about the economy of the Miami who are using this money using it for trade all the ... there were mass producing [noise]\nYes I think what it really does a\nIs under score the fact that the classic Maya had a marketplace economy and it was largely a lot of trade or in a regional economy so that various different\nKinds of exchanging fire things from short distance and long distance but if I think it was based on the household economy sort of a family business in this case making salt\nAnd making them in standardized shapes and sizes so the um\nFor example I looked at the ... three different sites of our Paint Creek salt works three different areas and they were making their their pots were different in their ... dimensions\nSlightly different and these were statistically significant differences suggesting to me that they they made their own hot\nAnd they they made the salt and they were doing it as part of a household economy um and then you know now we know that they were taking the Salt Lake standardize units of exchange\nAnd storage and also the salted fish taking them to inland sites and they were trading them the my of course didn't have a currency per se but they did have currency equivalent\nSeeds and I think salt cakes\nCan be discussed as a currency equivalency\nOr how much of this can be actually reconstructed\nYou say a lot of it was underwater and you know sea level\nRise I understand you you found a canoe panel\nWouldn't die in two thousand and four we found at five Fifteen we found\nA the first wouldn't post and then we started finding posts everywhere and we went back to cite fourteen and found a full size within canoe paddle four foot seven inches long\nWhich we've now are done it three D image of and you eat it's reconstructed and we've done uh we've printed\nBut full sized replica of it or we've found found it on a new as well and so that's sort of the infrastructure of distribution\nRough and well I Want to thank you very much Dr McComas protecting time to be with us today\nWill come down and swim with at some time and see for yourself\nI Am very I'm putting it on my list ... author of a study that was published in the proceedings of the national academies precedent apology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge\nOr we're going to take a break and come back and talk about the secret lives of squirrel monkey [noise]\nDidn't know they had a secret life we're in we're uncovering and here\nYou want to know the details stay with us we'll be right back after this spring\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nEspecially wait wait don't tell me gives you what you've always needed a break from the news astronaut Scott Kelly tells us why you need to double check your him an endless when floating in space ...\nReveals from most challenging role monsters and we hear often go be terrible ... of the exploding lasagna\nBitter said will join us for a mini vacation for your soul and the news with us from NPR's\nSaturday morning at ten on eighty nine nine W.

T.\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow in May of Nineteen fifty nine a small squirrel monkey from the jungles of Peru sat atop an American Jupiter rocket waiting her blast off into space\nMiss Baker was her name and after nine minutes of weightlessness she fell back to earth where she became enhanced\nAnd celebrity inundated with Leathers letters from school children and even the mob that press conference has one of the first two American animal successfully launched into and return from space miss bakers flight was a study and how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth analyzing their communications the structures of their societies\nAnd the brainy ways that they navigate their world\nDefinitely not like chimps they're like gyms only in the sense that they have really large brains but in terms of aggression um they don't defend territory so the groups are largely don't defend territory\nSo they can be overlap in a area is home ranges for a two or three groups they don't like to me very much but when they meet they pretty much just go their separate ways\nUh there's not a ton of aggression in the group except during the mating season between adult males than things can get pretty ugly\nWhere the speaking of that you bring up a good point because squirrel monkey virus was their societies female dominated correct for this species yes fishing yeah does that have anything to do with the fact that they're not that aggressive\nAh possibly um so for female dominated species we mostly see that in in lemurs really but for anthropology primates that's pretty rare really um one thing about square monkeys is that they have\nA very interest specific differences between a they're in their life histories and all species have very high degree of maternal investment but it's it's interesting to me that the two species where we see female dominance the females nurse the infants for a very long time\nSo possibly they getting priority of access to resources um that might be something that's going on\nFor what they ... females many species the men are the men pulled back then they know their place more\nThat's exactly how I Would describe it there's not that much aggression from females to males but the males kind of know their plate um the center of the groups is formed by adult females and\nUh they're juveniles and the males except for the mating season they pretty much stay on the periphery of the group minding their own business um and if they try to get too close to the infants and juveniles the females are not happy\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nTalking with Anita stone about the squirrel monkeys um [noise]\nSo any idea why society would involved one way or the other to have one gender dominate versus the other\nWell we know that uh for for most feces a female's invest a lot more in reproduction than than males do 'em in primates do have gestation lactation you have the difference between sperm and eggs\nSo I'm from studying primates where there is female dominance um we know that sometimes they live in very harsh environment and the female's having that this is true and lemurs where the females have priority of access to resource may have something to do about where they live\nUm and how the resources are distributed or in school lunches we're not exactly sure but others seven species there's only that there's only two that we know of that are female dominant\nYeah let me ask you about something I learned and\nThat the the the\nSquirrel monkeys have something called ... remain I consider it a strange behavior but for them it's called the urine washing\nYes I'm so this kind of became a side project in my research group because of a couple of students got really interested in it so\nThere's this odd behavior that's done it's not just were monkeys but ... do it to where an individual will your innate a few drops onto the palms of their hands and rub it on the soul of the foot and sometimes repeated on the other side\nI'm it it doesn't take very long it's pretty quick and we don't really have a good idea about why this happens if you look at the literature most studies were done with ... in captivity and different studies point at this point in all different directions\nUm some things that are being proposed are that it could be a form of sexual communication between adult males and females even thermal regulation as a way to cool down because for monkeys don't sweat\nBut what we found in our population is that juveniles do it much more than adults and um it also seems to be so that really ... almost rules out the the sexual communication idea because juveniles are doing it more\nBut it also seems to be linked to stressful situations so you know fights in the ... or some sort of turmoil and so one thing that had been suggested which I think our data support is that some form of anxiety displacements sort of like a stress reliever\nA much like you know bringing your hands when you're nervous or something like that um but we definitely need to dig deeper into that\nSo it's not like a territory marking know that your other animals to write\n... so that actually has been looked at a long time ago and a semi captive population that it's not territory marking it's not a way for 'em one individual to know where they're supposed to go to follow the group\nUm that doesn't seem to be the function of it yeah uh but it couldn't be that it has multiple functions that could mean something for adults and something else for juveniles\n... you know we've seen we've seen issues where a animal cultures we're learning more passing their culture down from one to another do see that in ... at all\nSo I've never actually seen a squirrel monkey use do what we would consider tool use it on in the wild um [noise] I I did hear about a ...\nSomething that sounded kind of like it in captivity so in terms of passing things down I Would think more that the constant proximity of the females with the juveniles and their constant communication I don't know what they're talking about\nUm but the the ... uh forging could very well be something that's you know the juveniles learn by observing the adults\nThat's terrific I Want to thank you both for taking time but for theft thank you for taking them to be with us today and need a stone assistant professor of biology California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks fascinating stuff well if you get back in the jungle ... thank you it's great to be here\nThe ... when we come back we're going to talk about the salmon swimming hundreds of miles was born\nAnd the magnetic sense of direction they stay with us we'll be
