Institute of Chicago because I learned so much from them and when teaching goes well it's a two way process and\nMy students has pushed me to think about it she's a social justice because they care about those questions so much and if you can find what you will students care about on tap into that then you can teach them so much better\nThrough things that are already motivating to them and so I gradually found more and more ways to think about mathematics\nBy asking questions about social justice and then there were those happened as well what I understood a lot more about these questions by using a mathematical framework I my students was so helpful and doing that I learned so much and so while I really should share this with the rest of the world and that's how this book ... about well\nWhat would be the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room at least for me is is because we too we argue all the time here what is the point of arguing logically if people are bringing emotions to the table and don't\nReally care about the facts and and now we can't even agree with the facts are don't don't you need to agree on something to be able to argue logically\nIt's a very good question and it can sometimes seem very few tile at the moment as if maybe we just doomed to take sides and the trouble is that if we think we're doomed to take sides then we will be ... very self fulfilling prophecy whereas\nI have found ways to understand what other people often king from that point of view\nAnd to find ways of bridging the gap to show that we're not actually on completely different planet it's not black and white it's usually\nThat that some kind of gray area in between and if I can find that we're both on the same gray area just in different places and it's much easier to think about sliding around it than to think about flipping an entire coin onto the other side\nThis is science friday from WNYC Studios\nI'm Ira Flatow talking with Dr Eugene Chang author of the ... of logic in an illogical world I'm so one of the first things you acknowledge is that the real world is actually a logical [laughter] but we had a lot of use but we get we can get a lot of useful work done in the abstract\nWorld yes we can find the logic inside situations even if the whole situation isn't completely no trickle on the discipline of mathematics begins with obstruction well you shave away some of the details that aren't completely relevant to the situation to find out what's really going on a route\nAnd when you've got to the root it that that you look at the logic and when you shave away those details you find that a lot of different situations become the same route and that gives you a way of connecting different situations on tapping into some understanding that you've achieved elsewhere and making connections between things but\nI I think that the shape that shaping away process [noise] excuse me is probably one of the most difficult parts\n[noise] it might be quite difficult and it's one of the things that is off putting about mathematics people often say to me I was finally\n... until the numbers became lapses\nAnd somehow that is scary step but actually numbers are already abstractions federal ready things where we shaved away the details\nThat two cookies and to apple well if you ignore the fact that the cookies and Apple's then you get the concept is too and we can do this with arguments in real life as well where we can shave away details and discover\nThat arguments about say voter suppression have something in common with argues about arguments about cancer screening and arguments about accusations of sexual harassment for example because they're all about what do we care about false positives mall or false negatives mall\nAnd then we can see that the dog and it's come up and questions about social services any questions about who should go to university and those questions are all over the place\nWhat are some of the most common ways that you see people being illogical when the orange\nOne of the basic ones is when they simply used the wrong definitions right to stop and this is one of the key ways in which we might think that people are using the wrong facts and so for example I've seen arguments on the Internet goodness me there are some bad arguments on the Internet ever\nI've seen arguments on the Internet where people say things like they they believe that all immigrants are illegal and that is correct or they they they support\nThe Affordable CARE Act but not Obamacare and they've got the wrong definition of Obamacare in that case or that was a study a survey of undergraduate male students that showed that many of them said that they would have known consensual sex if they thought they could get away with it but they would definitely not commit rape\nWhich means they've got their own definition of rape\nSo we have to agree on terms but we do and that's something that mathematicians have I castle about agreeing on terms right at the beginning so then another very common error that people make is when they make a false equivalence between one argument on another argument on this often happens in what's called a straw\nMan arguments apply prefer to call it ... because I didn't like Jen during things I'm necessarily but if you make an argument that seems quite reasonable to you sometimes somebody will replace it with a much more extreme arguments and believe that that's\nWhat you were trying to say and then they'll knock it down because the extreme argument is much easier to knock down and that can be very aggravating because that essentially painting you in a very bad light and then taking a moral\nHigh ground and I know that argument well talking with Dr Eugene Chang

conversations about the issues that get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately\nOur guest is Dr Eugene Chang or mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and we want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something\nBut I'm also an emotional person and those things can go together they on working against each other so you don't actually have to suppress or your emotions in order to be logical and\nIf anyone tells you that you're being too emotional and that that means you're not being logical that that just isn't true that doesn't have to be true anyway so what I say that yes it is very difficult to find the logic in a situation when you're feeling very strong emotions and that's\nWhere I feel that the mathematical discipline of obstruction really helps me because it means that I can look at a chain of legit\nAnd separate that out from the emotion so I'm not saying I shouldn't feel emotions but I put the emotions in a kind of different compartments and think about the chain of logical steps and this helps me to understand another person's point of view even if I disagree with them very very viscerally and I'm very upset about that position\nIf I ... from that I'm looking at that chain of logic step by step\nThen I don't have to feel what they are feeling but I can see the logic that they are using and those two things can be separate but then I can I can actually use the logic to be able to understand that point of view despite my emotional disagreements\nIs science friday from WNYC radio [noise] I'm Ira Flatow talking with your junior ... author of the art of logic in immunological world I think you know that is one of the hardest things to do these days is to just count to ten\nYou know that's a very important aspect of it because ... is a slow process and it doesn't happen in the format that is very popular in the current modern world which consists of a Mike drop or a one line or some kind of mean that don't have very many words in it or two hundred and eight to ... to tweet\nLogic takes longer than that and I wish that we could all take time to slow down our arguments so that we have time to explore the logic and build the logic\nMhm so you it's almost like mindfulness you know you have to find a way to catch yourself\nYeah in a moment is yes it is a lot like that and I think that that kind of mindfulness can help us understand the logic inside our own emotions because our emotions are all coming from somewhere there is something that is causing them and I honestly believe that when I see somebody who is feeling something emotional about something very differently from me\nIf I Do that mindfulness for them even if they are unable to do it for themselves then I can start to understand what that basic belief is from which all of this is stemming and maybe I can see how that basic belief\nIs different from my basic belief and that's why we're different things different things not because we are lodging is different but because of starting points to a different\nWay of about a minute or so left but I Want to I wanted to ask you about something you write a great deal about the logic of privilege relating virtually to race and gender is that area especially right for a logical treatment [noise]\nYes the arguments are um uh get very ... and some people get very upset about the whole question of privilege and identity politics and\nI think it's important for us to understand everyone's points of view and often it's a misunderstanding about what privilege means because for example white privilege does not mean the all white people are better off than all non white people\nIt means that any white person if they had all the same characteristics and the exact same life except that they were black as well we would expect them to be worse off in society and so some white people get upset because they say things like\nBut I I grew up poor and I have to work really hard so that means that I didn't have white privilege and we need to know that the fact that indeed that all white people who are really struggling and we shouldn't let our discussion of privilege\nIt raised that fact that they're all white people are struggling because if we raise that fact than they\nGet angry and feel that they have been disenfranchised and that they have no voice but we need to understand that if they were back then they would have an even last time and that's what the logic and the structure of privileges really about\nDr Chang thank you for joining us again as always it's a pleasure to have you back same out of luck with the book your junior Chang mathematicians scientists in residence at the school of the

A. at the Supreme Court\nFurthermore judge cabinet posts approach toward the doctrine\nOf separate belote is narrow wind up part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds he has argued for severing be invalid clause as surgically as\nPossible while allowing the overall law to remain intact\nFence was his approach and his to send in a case that involved a challenge\nTo the structure of the consumer financial Protection Bureau in his dissent judge Kavanaugh I argued for quote severing any problematic portion wells and\nLeaving the remainder intact\nAnd quote given the current challenge is to be a ca proponents including my self up protections for people with pre existing conditions should want to jazz says who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother assertion that I've heard often is that judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come before the court\nSaid basis for this argument seems to be twofold\nFirst judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes said Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution\nOr civil liability while in opposite\n... I Believe opponents miss the mark on the issue that fact to judge cabinet I offered Vince legislative proposal suggests said the print he believes that the president does not have\nSuch protection current play\nSecond there are some who argued that given the Kurds special counsel investigation President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate adjust to\nThat argument ignores our recent history\nPresident Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three nominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway and she was confirmed Ninety six to three\nThat next year just three months after independent counsel Robert fifth was named to lead the whitewater investigation President Clinton\nNominated justice brio he was confirmed eighty seven to nine\nSupreme Court justices have not hesitated to rule against some presidents who have nominated that perhaps\nMost notably in the United states versus Nixon three next send up point keys who heard the case joined the ... opinion against him\nJudge Kavanaugh had spin unequivocal in his belief that no president is above the law\nHe stated that ... versus Madison Youngstown steel versus ... and the United states versus Nixon arts three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases and the history why do they have in common is\nIs a case where Congress served as said check\nOn presidential power and I would note that the fourth case the judge cabinet has pointed to as some the greatest in history was brown versus the board of education\nOne cabinet dissension illustrates the point about a check on presidents empowered directly [noise] he wrote the opinion in harmed on\nTo the United states a case that challenges the Bush administration's military commission prosecution of an associate of a sign of bin Laden\nThis conviction what's very important to the Bush administration but judge Kavanaugh who had been appointed to the DC circuit\nBy President Bush and hadn't worked in President Bush's White House rule that the conviction was sons last fall as he explained during the hearing quote\nWe do make decisions based on who people are\nOr their policy preferences or at the moment we faced this decision on the law\nAnd quote\nOther sides met with have expressed concerns said Justice Kennedy's retirement threatens the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh\nDescribed the ... decision which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark\nHe also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece caged cake shop opinion for the court's majority stating that\nQuote the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans are gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens\nFor our in theory or in dignity and worth are over in the Supreme Court and quote\nOthers have suggested that the judge holds sing streams infused some birth control in one case judge cabinet encourage the does favor or both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women\nNow in the fall of value of waiting whether or not judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee some\nThat because since it's a lifetime appointment to our highest court court the public interest requires that ... resolve began the nominees\nOthers see the public interest as embodied in our longest established tradition of a forwarding to those accused of misconduct a presumption of innocence\nIn cases sandwich the facts are unclear they would argue that the question should be resolved in favor of the nominee\nMr President I understand both viewpoint this debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial but certain\nFundamental legal principles about due process the presumption of innocence and fairness do bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nIn the ... value waiting any given claim abyss contact we will be ill served in the long run if we a band and the ... son ... in the sense and fairness tempting though it may be\nWe must always remember that it is when passions are most in plain that fair that is most in jeopardy\nThe print some shouldn't have been since it's relevant to be advice and consent function when and if she accusations depart\nFrom it nominees otherwise exemplary record I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with the huge lead damaging\nTo the confirmation process\nMoving forward some of the allegations levied against judge cabinet illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor for\nBut if the allegations that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their we can stay ... gang re\nFist out last ditch alec cage was put forward without any credible supporting evidence and simply parachuted public statements some fathers fat such an allegation\nFind this way in to the Supreme Court confirmation process\nIt's a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness Mr President\nI listen carefully\nTo Christine Blasey Ford's testimony before the Judiciary Committee I found her testimony to be sincere\nPainful and compelling I Believe that she is such a survivor of sexual assault and that fits trauma has\nUp and did her\nNever the less\nThe for when and said she named could not corroborate any of the event some bad evening gathering where she says the is solved occurred\nNone\nOf the individual is professor poured says we're at the party has\nAny recollection at all of that night\nJudge Kavanaugh's forests fully denied the allegations under penalty of

lifelong friend\nLiaison Kaiser indicated that under penalty of felony she does not remembered that party and ms Kaiser went further\nShe indicated that not only does she not remember and I like that\nBut also that she does not even know Brett Kavanaugh\nIn addition to the lack of corroborating evidence we also learn some facts have raised more questions for instance since these allegations have become public professor poured testified\nThat not a single person\nHas contacted her to say I was that the party that not\nFurthermore the PR faster testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening she knew that because of that discussion she would've needed or bright yet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the ones\nWho drove her home or

not mean that President that professor for what's not sexually assaulted that night\nOr in some other time\nBut they do lead me to pay clues that the allegations fails to me the more likely than not
