the U.S gave about a hundred and eighty million dollars to that country what kind of programs to the U.S fund and are they effective\n[noise] yes that is that a hundred and eighty one million about thirty million went to borders and drug kind of hot\nBrings and sixty five point five million around there went to more domestic security\nTo that justice after a farm police reform violence

supposedly meaning\nI mean a lot of it as directed at improving institution you know in terms of working at the counter narcotics you know there's fourteen million going through the department of defense and hadn't million more going to drug interdiction\nBut I think I mean even within that and there's there's certain questions that are raised to the advocacy of it the current defense minister the current police chief and the president's own brother uh had all been\nImplicated in drug trafficking\nSo that you know that causes advocacy and some of some of the ... that we're spending on

... percent of the initiatives at that or you know directed at trying to address some of those problems\nAnd ... the United states has a big military presence in Honduras can you tell us a little bit about that\nYeah I mean currently yeah there's a major military base\nCalled the ... like on the air base that has five hundred six hundred troops and it's a habit all kinds of products operations in Central America but you know the hunters is one of the U. S. is closest allies in the region if not the closest militarily\nIt's always had a pretty close relationship and the Nineteen eighties it\nServed as a staging ground for the U.S says a covert war against communism in Latin America that's where they train right wing forces for operations in El Salvador Nicaragua you know and then you bring that up and said today where it's the closest ally in Central America where it receives the most said\nI Want to play a clip from a Mike Pence just a day before the caravan set out from Honduras the vice president spoke at a conference on security and here's what he had to say\nWe also need all the nations in the region to reinforce reversible message through your piece some issues from the heart that is don't put your family at risk\nBut taking a dangerous journey north to attempt to enter the United states illegally if they come to the United states legally they should not comfortable\nAnd you know what's your response to a pen says comments\nDesperate people do desperate things none of these people have undertaken these groaning ... almost three thousand miles\nFrom home because you know it's something they find to do in the fall and\nThey do it because they see no other choice I never left together because they see safety in numbers you know I'm I'm Mexico is one of the most dangerous ... migration passages in the wild ... multiple risks and I feel that if I come together they may stand by chance of making alive to the U.S would uh\nIf I went from like Penn face if if I think he was left together they're going to just try you know I've had so many people say to me like a da while you know eyedropper tried dying then stayed hunters and die of hunger or die because the guy and kills me I'm I'm just going to give it a shot\nAnd I'm Wondering how many of those folks are watching what's happening with the president's ah the President Trump's a family separation policy the potential for this to happen again I'm is out of concern at all ...

J. C. too\nYes okay so essentially what it means is that you're allowed to possess up to ... grams of cannabis anyone till out any any when living in Canada it's a lot to possess up to thirty grams of campus it also means that you can just purchased candidates freely\nOr in any kind of online retail retail store or\nSome brick and mortar stores that you know a licensed by the government they won the existence some provinces so far in Ontario for instance the on the way you can actually purchase legal cannabis it's two one story that are controlled by the government on line it's called the Ontario, Canada store\nBut over time you're going to see a lot more retail shops pop up which essentially means that you know if you're walking down the street in downtown Toronto eventually probably next praying you'll be able to just walk into a store and buy some tried flower\nNow we know obviously Canada is our northern neighbor will this have any impact on the border between Canada and the U.S\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's interesting there's been a lot of discussion about it if you're working in the cannabis industry in Canada are you going to be off questions and stop to the border when you've got across so\nThe way in which the messaging has gone out from the U.S side it's quite interesting so\nIn the beginning they said you know if you work in the industry if you have any kind of affiliation into legal industry even though you're crossing into a U.S state where medical marijuana Iraq uh it's legal you will not be able to get across the board it\nEven if you're not carrying candidates on you so now two weeks ago with the kind of the U. S. kind of backtracked on that and they said actually if you work in the marijuana industry in Canada you will be able to get across the border as long as you're not going to the U.S for work\nWhich is very interesting and also very problematic because that's a very strong business relationship that the U.S has with Canada when it comes to read a lot of American companies because you know we just not federally illegal there are listed on\nCanadian stock exchanges which means that the stress of very strong business relationship is a lot of capital a lot of us money flowing to the Canadian candidate sector and so that's bound to be travel uh between Canadians and Americans across the border for reasons of you know kind of business\nAnd we'll have more from von Miller super money in cannabis reporter for the financial posed in Toronto in just a minute they\nDrink and supported by time share hoping to do she releases I'm sure commitment [noise] learn more from Sharon in Dr\n...\nWe return now to our conversation about legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada with von Miller Subramanian cannabis reporter for the financial pose\n... we were just talking about this complicated business relationship that the United states and Canada have when it comes to marijuana and you said that there are marijuana businesses in the United states that actually are on the Canadian stock exchange that's fascinating to me\n[noise] yes so recreational read is legal in nine states in the U. S. N. D. C.\nSo in many of these states like California Colorado Oregon Washington state there in New ... businesses retail businesses\nYou know venture capitalists focused on investing in the marijuana industry\nBut the problem is how do these businesses raise money right the only way they can raise money because it's still quite a stigmatized drug is if they can list on another stock exchange and they can go public essentially\nYou know they can get an average investor to invest in them so what a lot of these businesses have done and and it's quite tickets in my last count was about you know twenty over American candidates businesses\nAre listed on the Canadian securities exchange the CSP which is now being up the pot index because of you know the number off campus company listed on it\nUh and so so as a Canadian or an American you can buy you can invest in these companies in Canada\nBut you can't do that in the U.S so that is the first I guess like you know most tangible strongest relationship between the U.S and Canada on campus\nLet's talk a little bit about the legality of this and the criminality of ... of marijuana and cannabis I mean we we have this issue in the United states where there are some states that have it legal as you mentioned some do not\nUm but we spoke to a quasi will soup empire and assistant professor at the University of Toronto in the director of research for the campaign for cannabis amnesty\nAnd he gave us some information about candidates history of criminalization of this drug and also discrimination let's take a listen\nKennedy was at the forefront of criminalizing buddy drugs for the opium actors nights in a way in the fall of the U.S to the criminalization of cannabis in Nineteen twenty three\nAnd not only where we early to do so but our drug laws were also quite racially motivated for an initial drug laws targeted are Asian as well as our black population and we've seen that play out in the way in which those laws were forced\nMy ... I'm curious are there similar disparities today a prior to this legalization in Canada\n[noise] yeah they are um actually vice did a really good investigation last year about this where they found out um cannabis charge us for pot possession what disproportionate be amongst black comedians and indigenous people in certain cities\nAnd you know the the the fact of the matter is that that's a big hypocrisy in the way in which the government has gone about legalization and the reason why I see this is because\nThere are examples of politicians from a D. A. officials actually former police officials investing in the legal cannabis space and that has been very little movement on the front took part in people for very simple pot possession charges like\nFor instance more than five hundred thousand Canadians have a criminal record for having pot on them so having pizza for possessing a small amount of read\nThem I Do want to ask you a question though there is some\nLegislation that's attempting to\nChange some of these convictions yes there is a movement building to expunged is Justin Trudeau has said that he did his plan however timeline hasn't been laid out side would jets and by saying it is that a conversation that\nMovement is building to explain to people but it hasn't actually come into reality it's a good thing that the ... and ... them\nBy molested reminding them as the candidates reporter for the financial posts and I spoke to her from Toronto things on mullah\n\n\nTake away is supported by progressive insurance within name your price too I'm providing information on a range of insurance coverage and price options\nProgressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that progress you\n\nI my replayed over one at a free babies born in the U.S is delivered via C section and the rain in some countries is even higher on the next science friday and look at what's behind the rise of C sections what this means for healthy babies and their mother\nPlus how farmers in Puerto Rico are rebuilding one year after Hurricane Maria on science friday from WNYC studio friday at two on eighty nine nine W.
