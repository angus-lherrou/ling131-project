I had to duck sometimes it was so bad\nYou go to a trial you're unprepared your family your embarrassing you get correct in multiple times you failed to prove your case in any way\nThat is bad when your critics for bears for you\nRight but here's the thing politically this did not hurt Kobach he went on to win the Republican primary for governor this summer by just if you vote here he is on the campaign trail\nFor camp for president from John for America [noise]\nI interviewed him this summer he told me that if he's elected he plans to keep on fighting this opposing voter fraud because the thing is is this is working for him\nEven though he was humiliated in court is federal commission was disbanded having achieved nothing the department of homeland security crackdown on cross check but he still may become governor of Kansas thanks in part because his crusade that he's lead against the problem that doesn't really exist\nThat is a record that speaks for itself face I think you Alice my pleasure\nWas Peggy Lowe of case you are in Kansas City\nPresident Trump was in Topeka campaigning for Kobach and I want to introduce\nGovernor of Kansas\nAt the same rally Kobach brought up\nYou guess voter fraud\nBragged about the voter id law he passed thing that Kansas has the most secure election laws in America he didn't mention that a federal judge turned that law\nThis week show was in partnership with Casey you are in Kansas City W.

Jacksonville\nAs law enforcement investigate the wave a pipe bomb mail to prominent Democrats\nWe take stock of the current partisan atmosphere\nThings were lined up for about two sixty years to have very low\nCross partisan animosity then begin the eighties one by one those decentralizing factors fell away and polarizing factors took their place\nWhy our country has more partisan even no political violence has dropped over the decades I'm tansy to Vegas and this is the takeaway\nAlso we end our series on the country's voting system with the call for big new ideas well sort of\nWe need to adopt the technology that has been well understood and technology is paper\nPlus an African American film festival pushes back against decades of Hollywood stereotype that same pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small\nThat doesn't fit anymore to take away we'll be right back after these headlines\nIt's called the hidden tribes report it was done by a group based in the u._k. but they're studying this kind of polarization and the rise of populism all over let's let's bear in mind that this American problem is not unique to America we are many European countries are are seeing some similar problems as well\nAnd I think the ... the way to think about this is that America used to have a we used to have many different cross cutting identities and even our two parties the Republicans and the Democrats each had a liberal and conservative wing to them\nAnd one of the big changes that's very risky for our democracy is that from the beginning of the Nineteen eighties through the Nineteen nineties especially the two main political parties purified so that all the people with progressive mindset where one party the Democrats and all the people the conservative mindset when the other\nEnd so our two parties didn't used to be the most important tribes in the country but by the Nineteen nineties by by Bill Clinton's first election the electoral map had reached its present format\nAnd the two parties have become among our most important tribes such that now people really really don't want their children to marry someone from the other tried they don't care as much about religion or racist they used to and in the sixties is just the opposite\n... what kind of impact is that having on us and how much is social media exacerbating that\nThat's really the place to go with this in terms of the impact on us a way to think about this is that human beings evolved for tribal is there is no doubt\nThat our minds were shaped by our long long evolutionary history living in tribes\nThat competed violently with neighboring tribes and so you can see this or you know we we love to do tribal isn't so much that if you just watch a college boys are doing fraternity initiation they mimic a lot of the a lot of the process is that after ... snow in traditional societies\nSo we're designed for tribalism but it doesn't mean we have to live in tribal ways and some societies can play up those tribal sentiments and something play them down or the mid to late twentieth century it was really unique\nIn that everything lined up to play down tribalism within the United states of course there were so many tribal loyalties but we had for the only time in our history as far as I Know we had a media environment that was truly centralized and\nIn the early days the republic the media was extremely heart is in full of lies and in the in the once we had radio and TV and we had regulation of that we had three centrist center left networks\nSo there were a lot of forces pulling us really to the center there was a common enemy originally and the Nazis in Japan and then on to the Soviets\nSo in so many ways things were lined up for about fifty or sixty years to have very low cross partisan animosity then beginning in the eighties one by one those centralized factors fell away and polarizing factors took their place\nMedia as you say is this the most important to look at from cable TV through the Internet and now social media\nHow much does race factor into this and the reason why I'm asking is because we're in a moment right now we're our president\nHas just called himself a nationalist um I think in this country we're seeing race sending you know yes we're talking about Democrat and Republican but race is something that we can't ignore and I'm Wondering the decades that you've described were also decades in which people of color American people of color or we're making gains\nUm social gains after many many many decades of of attempting to do that and so do you think that has played into more of the tribalism\nYes race is really complicated and important it's woven through all of this so first on the optimistic side the wonderful thing about a country like America is that it has long been based on an idea not on blood and soil not on having a race or religion\nAnd there is a general there's a large scale consensus in this country the great majority of people do believe that if you come here you can become an American you join our culture you work you know you share a reference for for the for the founding documents you're an American\nThat's what most Americans believe and the ... century it was a time of huge progress obviously from you know literally legal segregation with Jim Crow\nTo a an enormous gains for all groups including African Americans\nSo America is you know could do this really well it has been a peek into the world now when Trump calls himself a nationalist that is a potentially dangerous turn usually people use the word patriotism a patriot as one who loves one's country not because it's the best in the world but because it's your country\nAnd when he identifies as a national if he is linking I think to more European\nBlood and soil nationalist and ... and some of the things he said have clearly been not even dog whistles have been fairly explicit about race and racism so this is an alarming trend I don't think it reflects a fact about America at large but it does reflect something about a one of the tribes the furthest right of the\nOf the seven tribes described in this report\nAnd gender than you know even even yesterday I was looking at Twitter after the uh the bomb threat to come in and you know watching former colleagues at CNN leaving their\nOffices et cetera and there were folks um even on the right who were calling for the president to be uniting figure a saying you know probably having a rally tonight isn't the best idea\nA you know you should give a speech you know trying to unify people my question to you is we're in this downward spiral as you said\nIs it or or could we stop this with a leader a president who is much more unifying is that really what we need right now\nWell that is one that is it necessary but not sufficient and to his credit Trump or the the one comment I saw he did at least say something you did have a sound clip that was the right thing to say\nBut yes we will need a president who is a nighter\nBut these trends have been going on since the Nineteen eighties there's about six or eight of them that that I could list most of them are irreversible so I think we can't be thinking that once Trump is out of office maybe there'll be a more moderate uplifting president someone who can perform really the spiritual duties of the role\nBut that's not going to be enough to save us because these trends have been going on for a few decades um we need to think about how do we reform our political system that inspires more trust\nHow do we remove the increasing it paramount role of money and in particular we have to realize that we are all caught in a system that plays up our worst instincts now and we all as individuals\nHave to adapt to this that is when you hear a horrible story about somebody on the other side you have to remember yes that's one person on the other side that's not what they're all like\nWe're going to have to somehow find a way to adapt to a world in which outrages are forced down our throats every day and we still somehow remember that were citizens of one country and that's a great majority of our fellow citizens\nAlso love this country are concerned about both racism and political correctness that's one of the findings of the tribes record\nAnd we have to find a way to adapt and move forward together\nJonathan height as a social psychologist at the New York university stern school of business Jonathan thank you my pleasure\nHow do you feel

to go out and vote on election day well\nThis is the population that has historically voted in very low numbers in twenty fourteen as Hispanic voters in dodge city voted at a rate of Seventeen percent which is pretty abysmal and\nSince then and in Kansas where Kris Kobach is the secretary of state voter ID laws and and other lies that he's put in place has only made it tougher for a lot of people to vote so I think it's reasonable to expect that the Hispanic turnout\nOr would have been even lower this time potentially a even before this change in a polling site was made and and one of their problem to mention here is pulling site now serves Thirteen thousand voters which is a really large number of from polling site in a\nWestern Kansas the average at polling site serves twelve hundred voters the or potentially looking at\nReally long lines at the polls and us for folks who are working class who are trying to get to their jobs that's just one more deterrent to voting on election day\nNow we're hearing across the country that are companies like lift in over a ride out companies ride share companies are going to be trying to give rides to people to the polls during the election cycle this year are there is that going to happen\nIn a dodge city and if so is that sufficient to get people to the\nPolls that is happening now once just started to get some publicity and and people started to realize how problematic this was going to be left\nStepped up and said they would gladly take folks to the polls are the question that hasn't been answered is exactly how many lift drivers are there in dodge city Kansas and a lot of\nHave that side there certainly aren't a lot of lift drivers I'm not sure how many new drivers they can train between now and election day at the Democratic party has said that they would raise\nFunds and try to bring in folks um to help take people to the polls so there certainly are effort to make this a little bit easier for folks I guess the question is whether uh whether voters will become aware of these options and whether they will seek them out in\nIn general I I think that we should try to make voting easier not harder for for people and if we add extra steps\nOr make them do more research or seek out rides on it that's just one more reason they might say yeah I just don't have time to deal with this\nPolling Nelson at the editorial page

it is a complex one that oftentimes really looks at a very kind of flat one dimensional understanding of\nStorytelling of people and has historically been riddled with stereotypes and pejorative images\nThat's ... she's the curator of film and photography at the national museum of African American history and this week marks the start of the museums first ever African American film festival and combs says the films being shown push back against harmful Hollywood troops\nThere has been a very rich tradition of image makers black image makers in particular who have fought against that tide has\nPushed fervently to showcase very complex and complicated stories so we want to be able to celebrate and recognize the fact that there have been those under told stories\nThat have been produced and being made for decades\nMany of the films in the festivals lined up are from the Nineteen sixties and seventies an era when activists were starting to recognize the power of film\nYou have people speaking out against injustice\nAnd they were picking up a camera and so it's really exciting that we're able to show work like this one piece called Malcolm X struggle for freedom that hasn't been screened in the last thirty to forty years and we've restored this film that looks at Malcolm X. in Paris\nThree months before he was assassinated\nThe restoration process that combs mentions there is that the center of the museums overall mission when it comes to African American cinema Cain river a Nineteen eighty two film directed by horse Jenkins is among those that are being featured after being restored\nSo different from\nShort of\nJenkins was an Emmy Award winning documentary filmmaker and Kaine river what's his first feature late narrative film just months after the film premiered in New Orleans the forty two year old director died of a heart attack and Kaine river never received distribution after my father\nDied that was it flash forward to a couple of years ago and I found an article in New York Times about an organization called and you collect and they had found this film and they were looking to restore it so I reached out\nTo them and I said hey I'm sausage Jenkins horses my dad and I'm a filmmaker to what's up and met with the ... people and they've been really amazing and then you know some years later here we are\nThat's ... son who was only around ten when
