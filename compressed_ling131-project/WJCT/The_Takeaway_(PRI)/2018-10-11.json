that the police union sent along the bland one paragraph statement saying they look forward to working with ...\nA guy who works for a big clothing store here doing security really wanted to talk\nBut his stores corporate office wouldn't let him\nHe told me shoplifting is a constant problem he's still catches people stealing but now after the police come and arrest them the da says just to let them go with a ticket\nWhen somebody does end up in a city passers prosecutors sometimes withdraw their case anyway the guy said one habitual shoplift there came back to his store and stole against so fast that he still had the cheese sandwich from jail in his backpack\n\nThis summer I ask crossers office for some data I wanted to know eight months into his term what were they actually doing with the police still arresting people for prostitution in shoplifting and was his office turning all those cases away his press guy handed me some statistics about five minutes before I sat down with crafts and our for an interview\nSo I've just got this um and I have other questions for you but I'm curious you know what to do\nWith this the first time your office has kind of got a tally of the cases you're accepting and declining in this way\nThis is these are the first metrics I have seen\nA we have a general sense of what we were doing because we passed certain policies that could not help but push us in this direction but these metrics or the first that I've seen and so for example they reflect the fact that we're no longer charging\nSex workers with crimes because\nSimply book review them for the most part is\nVictims are we\nOn the piece of paper I could see that overall ... office had declined to prosecute about seven percent of the cases the police brought them that means that the police had arrested someone in each of those cases and each time the da's office had said no let them go we're not charging them\nThe previous da ... however it around two or three percent\nTwo and a half percent declaration rate is a rubber stamp that means what ever the police want is what I Will do\nCrafts there's office is on track to charge about two thousand fewer we'd possession prostitution and shoplifting cases this year that's compared to what the da's office did in twenty Seventeen two thousand fewer cases [noise]\nSo what about all those people\nThe people ... trying to help by not putting them in jail\nDiane I Love you come\nWe're talking about what it's like in jail\nHi this is Amanda I met her in Kensington a neighborhood in North Philly people are selling buying injecting drugs out in the open I'm just going to use first names for the women I talked to there since they all had outstanding fines and warrant\nAmanda says she's been arrested twelve times for prostitution and told me the cops have sometimes been rough with her arresting are so many times also just seemed like a waste of resources I'm a I think on the whole prostitution thing I think it's a great idea with them not charging anybody with anything this is\nWhat I had expected here then I ducked into the backyard of a recovery house a place for women trying to stop using drugs to sit down with another woman named ... tell I asked ...\nWhat does she think of ... decision to stop charging most prostitution cases um yeah I don't think that's a good idea [laughter] she didn't tell stopped using heroin and moved into this recovery house a few weeks ago\nBut she's been caught up in shoplifting and doing sex work to pay for drugs for years she kept saying that Phillies opioid problem is out of control especially in this neighborhood\nIf it's a big problem inauguration and people don't want to touch it and get involved but if we avoid it it's just going to go away it's not just going\nIs it does not charging shoplifting and prostitution seem like avoiding the problem too\nYes absolutely yes absolutely I feel like they're condoning my bad behavior\nShane tell is very clear she is not saying jail is the answer but the idea of getting ignored by law enforcement as flawed as the system is that feels to tell like people in power are saying we don't care what happens to you\nAnd saying well we just can't keep sending you to jail so here you go just\nTo living in like death you know it's cool just keep moving in how everything will be fine\nI told ... office what Chantal said press person sent me a statement saying\nThey do want people like her to have a way out they see sex workers as victims who need help and the da's office can help them\nIf somebody's been convicted a few times before for prostitution crashed our policy is to charge them and then instead of sending them to jail put them in a diversion program where they get connected to rehab and counseling\nBut Crowder is office also said charging is really not the best way to help people like ... because that can leave them stuck with a criminal record bottom line it should be easier to get help without ever getting arrested or charged at all\n[noise] [noise] [laughter]\nCrass are maintains that the other crimes have declining to charge specially marijuana possession just fall into the category of dumb\nBy declining the prosecution of dumb we can put more and better police resources and prosecution of resources into the prosecution of serious crimes of tear apart society hyper violent crimes sexual assault\nYou know gun play among people involved in gangs and Warren groups we focus on that and that's what we want to do\nPresidents that about three more years in this term three years to prove to the city that he can put fewer people in jail and at the same time find his own brand of toughness for the most serious crime [noise]\nThat's the way from ... in Philadelphia

Jacksonville your community your world [noise]\nPeople have been fired people have been hurt people if and jumped and killed\nJust for being out as transgender are being found out [noise]\nDrawing attention to violence against transgender people in the\nCommunity at least in the folks who knew the women who had been killed felt like there really wasn't any accountability\nAdvocates said this year could be the deadliest on record for transgender American I'm tending to Vegas and this is the takeaway also on the show and update on the destruction Florida from hurricane Michael and the persistent poverty of St Louis\nOverall according to census out of the poverty level have gone down but in places like St Louis [noise] people are still waiting to see that economic growth that Trump and his administration has been counting all that and more on the take away right after these headlines [noise]\nWhat that is a byproduct of the fact that when trans phobia is mixed with massage knee and racism it can have often deadly consequences\nThe more prejudiced as a person has to interact with on any given day compounds that discrimination compounds the barriers that are putting their way and that when you combine these prejudices it can embolden and inflame existing violence and that's one of the main reasons why we see transgender women of color\nSo disproportionately over represented in the number of victims but die each year\nSarah how much does income and demographics outside of race have to do with this we know that twenty nine percent of transgender responding to the twenty Fifteen US trans survey said they were living in poverty Fifteen Percent were unemployed and twelve percent had been homeless\nOne of the things we always want to make clear and we're talking about the violence case my trans community is that in many cases individuals who are experiencing are facing violence are facing circumstances where violence is more likely due to institutional or systemic barriers to staple employee\nThat just sheltered access to goods and services that people need to live and thrive and so when you add in all of these stomach barriers it can often times put people in circumstances where they're more likely to face kind of violence\nAnd we mentioned that tomorrow in March Twenty years since Matthew Shepard died um the Shepard Byrd act which was named after him gives the department of justice the power to investigate and prosecute bias motivated crimes against algae teach you victims is there more of a need for protection specifically for transgender Americans\nWell as you mentioned in your intro there are a number of states that still do not have inclusive protections light comes to hate crimes are we also need more states and the federal government to pass\nNondiscrimination protections for algae ... people particularly transgender people because as we've talked about there are so many factors contributing to this violence if not just\nA matter of passing inclusive hate crimes it's about making sure we have better data collection for a clear picture at it's about making sure that transgender people are safe from discrimination that can oftentimes put them in these circumstances\nFair McBride is the national press secretary for the human rights campaign Sara thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me\n\nHow to local police and the criminal justice system deal with murders of transgender people\nLucas wilderness a reporter at ProPublica who's been keeping track of homicides of trans people and investigations throughout the country what\nHappens often during a homicide investigation with the ... victim as folks will look at someone's ID or how perhaps they are listed on a birth certificate state issued id and go with kind of the gender marker that is listed on that id but normally it's an ... an ass\nAnd so to ... someone is to essentially call someone by agenda that they don't identify with so at someone who's ... as you know female and you are consistently referring to them as he and ham and you know with male pronouns\nThe term dead naming comes into play when you're using a name that someone does not use anymore to describe themselves so trends folks are often you know given a name at birth that might match you know the gender the sex that they were assigned at birth\nOn and then later in life uh you know kind of walk away from that name and start living in a different life with a different name\nAnd so when we think about dead naming it to turn that does not just apply to you know murder or homicide cases kind of a term used throughout the transgender community to describe calling someone by name that they just don't identify with anymore\nAnd I'm Wondering how that impacts the investigations into these crimes that we're looking up\nSo the way that we see this play out a lot across the country and what I found in in my reporting with my colleague ... who's my co reporter on this project\nWe've found that police departments are often uh using state issued id is that are often out data and to refer to homicide victims and you know by nature homicide victims can't advocate for themselves or say how they want to be identified and so the problems we see with that are a couple of different things first\nWhen you go to the community and you're describing someone by a name and agenda that they no longer identify with oftentimes their community their friends even our family sometimes won't know who you're talking about and that\nCan be a really big problem and investigations of all kinds but especially homicide investigations so when you go into the community and you say you know Michael has died or have you seen Michael recently\nAnd folks are saying I don't know might call you know this is this friend of mine is someone that I Know by a very different name and by uh you know a gender that might not line up with what Michael implies\nSo we see that as a barrier to investigations kind of all across the country and we looked at some specific states to get a better understanding of how police were consistently\nReleasing names to the public that just didn't match up with what people knew these these people by so you know there are some resources available to police but one of the things we found over and over again we looked into a five different homicides of transgender folks\nAnd in every case we you know called we contacted the police department or the sheriff's office and well we heard over and over again was not so much that they were you know like grappling with this issue or weren't sure what to do it was just they had absolutely no policy or NO PLAN for how to interact with the transgender community\nAbout homicides but also just more generally speaking and so that's kind of where we are seeing some police departments start as trying to kind of create a policy to say oh we're not going to you know consistently dead name someone or we're going to try to figure out how someone prefer to be called or identified\nBoth because it's a more respectful way to treat that person but also because it is actually going to make our investigation easier\n[noise] is there\nAnything that's leading to sort of a culture of impunity when it comes to cases like this I think there are a few things one thing that we heard from trans women especially trans women in Jacksonville, Florida where we've seen these three murders of transforming this year\nThat have been unsolved with the women there told us that it felt like there was a culture of impunity because you know it didn't felt like there are resources\nBeing put into looking into murders of you know poor black trans women on I think we see that you know outside of the trans community as well but folks not really placing a priority on the lives of\nThe you know people in our communities that are poor that don't have access to a you know the resources that other the other people have so\nI think there's a structural problem with police scene in that way in the cases that we looked at there was a a wide range of different different situations you know some women were killed in hotels and in many situations those cases are unsolved it's like\nThe police come and they kind of take stock of the scene and then we don't really hear anything about you know ever a recipe made investigation is just sort of ongoing forever in other cases you know domestic violence cases where the perpetrator might be much easier to find there is a little bit more accountability but you know by and large most of the cases we looked at\nUh the community at least in the folks who knew the women who had been killed\nFelt like there really wasn't any accountability you know related to their friends death\nAnd you're a reporter who's been covering this extensively but also as a trans men yourself do you feel like there any things that you see that could be done to improve this yeah you know it's interesting as a as a trans person myself this was a story that\nThat's really important to me I'd had my own experiences you know struggling to get a tender marker change in the name change on my ideas and\nYou know I I had issues accessing that even given the fact that I Know it didn't if I on the ... side of the spectrum and I'm white and I don't have a lot of the barriers that other folks have\nSo what I see is that we really do need local police to have more consistent policies about how they approach trans folks are folks that they don't know what their gender identity might be and I think one of those solutions to that problem is\nJust asking people asking the community how does your friend identify how can we treat them respectfully you know what can we do to make sure that we're not consistently calling them by name that they didn't go buy 'em and I think that's really the first step is folks just\nTalking to the community more\nLucas wilderness a reporter at ProPublica Lucas thanks so much for joining us they give\n[noise]\nOn them at first 'cause connect a conversation with
