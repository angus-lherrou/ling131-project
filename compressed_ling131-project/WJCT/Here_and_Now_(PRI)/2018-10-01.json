thing\nThe true nature of reality that and [noise]\nJust beyond those talks those ideas\nFrom NPR [noise]\nI'm Guy rise coming up most\nCities around the world or in the ... family for that earns under fourteen thousand dollars is now classified as low income that's ridiculous you only cities were building or those I think to all of us how we design major urban areas could well determine whether we are not as if\nAnd it's not how we can build one [noise]\nI think that we all have a sense of responsibility and accountability and how our cities develop particularly those of us who come in with any degree of power or privilege\nAnd if we do not leverage that to sort of asked how do we develop this in a way that makes sure that everyone has a chance at opportunity and that those who have been most impacted our centered in our understanding\nOf what we need to do than we're all just complicit in the ... of these people and their history from these communities\n[noise] for the past\nFew years ... has been working on a project in Bay view hunters point it's a low income neighborhood in San Francisco and she's been focused on thirty acre plot of land there a plot of land that used to be the site of a power plant\nIn the nineties a community group led by mothers who lived in a public housing on the helicopter paths fought for its closure\nThey walk utility company finally tore it down clean the soil\nAnd kept most of the fight with asphalt so that explains why wouldn't blow away [noise]\nThe utility company could develop on this site for a while for reasons that had to deal with land entitlements lease agreements et cetera et cetera So Liz was\nOf a design team that came up with creative ways to use the land\nAnd for the last four years we've been collaborating with those mothers and other residents as well as local organizations\nAnd the utility company [noise] we've been experimenting with all types of\nEverything from job training workshops\nTo an annual circus\nShe even a beautiful new shoreline trail\nA few months ago there was a community meeting in this neighborhood utility company was finally ready to talk long term redevelopment that meeting\nWhich kind of a disaster there is a lot of yelling and anger are people out things like if you're going to sell it to the developer once they just built luxury condos like everyone else\nAnd where's the city then\nAren't there more jobs and resources in this neighborhood [noise]\nYeah I mean I can understand why people were\nAngry you know they were probably thinking well wait a minute we've lived with his power plant for generations and now you're going\nTo sell the land to developers and make condos that we can't afford 'em and pushes out of our homes\nYeah and I think that they'd been seen that story play out again and again and again throughout the neighborhood any time there was a piece of land that that came up maybe there was a little\nSet aside for affordable housing but there wasn't nearly as much as people thought there should be so while they see people coming in and saying oh OK baby it's no longer the ghetto we can\nRead develop it that it wasn't necessarily read developed with them in mind and so their greatest fear here was that the story was about to play out again and it stunk even more because it was the site that they had fought for [noise]\nHolding space for ... was never part of my job description as an architect but I've seen what happens when there's space for pain [noise] it can be transformational [noise] when we first started working in the neighborhood [noise] one of the first things we did was go out and interview the activists who had led the fight to close the fats\nWe consistently heard and felt a sense of impending off\nWhen I was ... running around in the bay view it was a little different because it was more family\nBack then as a child who was perfection\nPeople were leaving or dying of old age and with those departures stories were being ...\nA lot of people had open door policy you could just go from one building to the next\nNo one was going to know the amazing things that had happened in this community because everyone on the outside it was the ghetto [noise]\nWhere's the place of violence at best a blank slate neither was true of course [noise] so my colleagues and I reached out the story corps and we built to listening to identify\nAt the end of the block was a sewer system and of course we have the smells every morning and all of that\nAnd we invited the residents to comment and have their stories recorded for posterity\nUh what was special about about that area is that there was this patch in green grass and we had no parts around so either we play it on the block in the street or we found this little patch\nAfter a few days of recording we how the lifting party my dad worked\nThere for a job she was a fisherman he raised chickens he had a garden every Saturday I could just remember people come to my house the bags and getting strawberries and I didn't I didn't feel like I was poor and living in private he just 'cause I grew up in Bay view\nIt was one of the most amazing community meetings I've ever been a part of ... because we didn't just talk about joy but also pain\nWhen the crack epidemic hit it went crazy\nPlaces I bet you\nBecame more crime rate and infested\nAnd right now we're just losing so many families\nWe can I create cities for every one unless her first willing to listen to everyone [noise]\n\nUm and we should say that you know the debate over how this site will be developed as I think it's still ongoing right yes [noise]\nWhat happens if if nothing changes if um you know cities like San Francisco and New York aren't just anomalies but that we start to see that in lots more places I mean we are right yeah and people who\nHave lived in neighborhoods in those cities that were relatively affordable can't do it any more um what what happens if nothing changes\nGosh it's a hard question I mean what we're seeing happening right now it's unsustainable and and when I say on sustainable I don't mean that it can continue to happen but I think\nThe things that we ascribe to being beneficial for living in a society or in community the aspirations we have what that looks like eventually all of this pushes it to the point where that breaks\n[noise] I mean any part of a system that's driving this as you know it developers who by the land in the building condos and then expect a certain return like from every\nEvery unit every condo sold right yeah but could you test out something that works in a different way yeah I mean like could American cities take you know big chunks of land and do something very different without land\nIt's a it's a huge better frisk and it would require you setting up um other metrics of success\nRight like happiness or wellbeing or or health outcomes or yes\nI think it's completely reframing how we think about this like we shouldn't be talking about how we should be talking about home yeah\nBecause we talked about housing we judge or a success number of units created\nShouldn't we be judging in terms of number\nBetter lives lip [noise]\nIt it it's harder to figure out how to measure that [noise]\nI don't know if this\nProject that we call the city [noise]\nUltimately can work if we don't start to measure our success in those terms\nLives oh boo you can check out her entire talk ... dot com [noise]\nBuildings humane cities guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour

I'm an architect and author I'm also a professor\nAt Columbia University but she was born in Calcutta, India but as a kid he moved to Massachusetts where you haven't felt like an outsider I grew up in a suburb outside of Boston kind of hated every minute of it um it was a very sort of racist violence upbringing\nAnd for immigrants especially I'm a first generation immigrant\nYou speak differently than other people you look different the people there and so there's this tendency to feel a little\nHomeless or lost Sean became an adult he ended up relocating to New York city and for the first time in his life he didn't really feel\nDifferent you know what I immediately encountered when I came to New York was this feeling like I kind of discovered a long lost twin brother [noise]\nNo one really question whether you belong here you belonged automatically by virtue of being here and I think\nOne of the great things that are truly great city does is provide the sense that\nYou belong by virtue of who you are not\nYou know what your background is\n... thinking about what happened was that made the city so welcoming and after becoming an architect and he noticed that a city's vibrancy and inclusive and he\nHas a lot to do with\nIf you think about architecture is an act of writing in the city you have to read the city first and all of the basic components are human components they need to invite diversity across race gender sexual orientation and especially class in socioeconomic structure\nAnd he says the key difference between a welcoming city to last welcoming one\nIs scale because so many of our modern cities were designed around big anonymous buildings with streets that aren't likeable and almost no places for people to just gather but ... says older cities around the world were built on a much more human scale\nIt's not a one size fits all thing but I think pre twentieth century cities all around the world tend to be much more dynamic lyrical\nPlaces savannah let's just take that as\n\nYou look at those arch but aspirin bridges you're going over now the clearances actually quite low so the first is offering gone to lift standing and they know they have to duck to get under the bridge so they don't call a lawyer when their forehead\nHits the bridge 'cause they made a mistake they know it's their responsibility to duck and so I think to get to a more humane city that entails maybe\nMore risk but more reward you know you can go to Israel to India to Rome and you'll find um there was a building block for building density in the nineteenth century which was one elevator this kind of a charming cable elevator ride that has like coming through it\nAnd then there's one staircase the cops around it and usually that apartment building had like twenty unit and you see that each building is maybe fifty feet long sixty feet long and so you get this tremendous variation one is brick one stone doorways are different\nAnd so you have this kind of rhythm along the street you run into your neighbor everyone knows each other it's very communal\nThat form of building is a legal today\nBecause of fire codes and wheelchair regulations and a whole bunch of things so now you need you know a few elevators and you need to set the fire stairs and that's all connected by a law anonymous hallway and suddenly a developers really incentivize to build a two hundred unit building instead of a twenty unit building\nIn order to sort of advertised all of that costs and as a consequence it's very hard to know your neighbors and a two hundred unit building and so the scale which we build is different\nAnd I'm more mass produced and so you see the same building landing in Shanghai Mumbai and Dubai and so I I don't want us to be an architect or an urban planning to understand these issues I think people are feeling this viscerally I hear this\nEverywhere I go from everyday people who aren't trained in this at all but field is kind of creeping homogenous nation of their\nGirls they shine ... body except his idea from the Ted stage\nNow maybe you think I'm just being ... why does it matter who cares if there is this creeping sameness setting our planet well it matters because\nMost people around the world are gravitating to urban area of globally and how we design those urban areas could well determine whether we thrive are not as a species\nAnd this is not just an aesthetic issue mind you this is an issue of international consequences because today\nDay literally hundreds of thousands of people are moving into a city somewhere\nAnd when you think about that ask yourself or they can down to live in the same bland cities we built on the twentieth century or can we offer them something better\nIt seems to me that one of the things that make them in many cities especially cities and wealthy countries like India humane is there in accessibility to so many people it's it's it's like\nYou know the city has become this inhumane place because it keeps people away because it is so expensive to live in a city like like New York city\nOr San Francisco or or Boston or London or\nParis [noise] yes and in fact one of the things I worry about with the U.S is you know\nThere's a lot to compliment about European cities but one of the things we need to be really careful up as most European cities have almost all of their poor people living on the outskirts on the periphery\nA and only really the well to do live in the heart of these beautiful cities that we talk about and the problem often is market rate housing doesn't feel like it's helping to address the problem because\nYou know it's out of reach now there are ways in which government subsidize affordable housing but as an architect one of the things we're looking at is how do you lower the cost of housing\nSo that construction costs can come down and that allows people to charge less rent a than they otherwise would and this is where mass transit infrastructure and infrastructure more generally is so important because\nWe don't have to think about the city is just the city limits there is a region around every major city and if we have better mass transportation to get people to work from twenty or thirty or forty miles outside of the city\nThen they can live a transit oriented lifestyle without living in the heart of the city in a lot of people will choose that if we give them good transit options\nAnd we're actually seeing those transformations happening all over the world in big ways in small ways\nIn just a moment to Sean imagine how technology could help us me design cities and allow us to bring the humanity of older cities into the twenty first century stay with us and guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from

just before the break we were hearing from architect ... ... says designed could be part of the solution but it's largely depends on how we use technology\nTechnology was a big part of the problem in the twentieth century when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention and we recreated our landscape around\nUm you're probably not paying attention and if we just look at this thing through a collective impact lands we can make a bigger difference in people's lives and we can do as a community and to be proud of that\nYeah I mean despite the fact that clearly this has had some impact in Albuquerque meet people shouldn't expect that all of that and this is going to eradicate that the homelessness problem or or start panhandling entirely right\nWell we shouldn't be afraid to try hard things either from a policy standpoint from a community standpoint just because it looks daunting [noise] if\nYou stick with it you can actually make a difference and we were able to do that but then as you find out as a mayor you get up the next day and there's another issue there is another challenge something changes the economy goes up the economy goes down and so it\n... you can't rely on one thing and you just you can't stand idly by you have to continually try to look for best practices yeah and so it goes\nWhen you were mayor of a of a major American city mayor of even smaller community you see people on their worst day\nYou see things happen that keep you up at night and ... most of the time you see people thriving you see people helping each other but you never lose the sense that there's just a long way to go everywhere that would be inhumane and being compassionate just about\nSo you just try to build a mix of opportunities for people so that they can lift each other up because\nThe government can just do it all it has to be neighbor lifting up neighbor [noise]\n\nRain Barry he's the former mayor in Albuquerque you can see his entire attacking at ... dot com [noise]\nOn the show today building humane cities and language and Barry just said part of making a city more humane comes down to neighbors helping neighbors and writer drew felt experienced is when he bought a house in ... if you felt on the stage\nIn two thousand nine I bought a house of neighborhood called whole town\nHad no windows no plumbing no electricity and it was filled the trash\nThis of course as the Detroit that you share about making a mistake Israel [noise] there's another Detroit to another Detroit that's more hopeful more innovative and made just provide some of the answer is just said he's struggling to reinvent themselves everywhere\nIs answers however [noise] to not necessarily adhere to conventional wisdom about their development\nI think the traits real strength boils down to two words radical neighborly ness and I wasn't able to see it myself until I live there\nDuring the year I worked on my house before moving in I Lived in a micro community inside poll town founded by a wild and virtuous farmer named Paul words\nPause a teacher has tried public school for pregnant parenting mothers and his idea was to teach the young women to raise their children first raising plants and animals\nPaul brought much of this innovation to his locking poll town which he started for more than Thirty Years' purchasing houses when they were abandoned convincing his friends to move in and they were to stay and helping those who wanted to buy their own fix them up\nIn a neighborhood where many blocks now only hold one or two houses all the homes on pause box than it's incredible testament to the power of community just staying in one place and to taking ownership of one's own surroundings simply doing it yourself\nRadical neighborly nest is every house behind pause block burning down and instead of letting it fill up the trash and despair Paul and the surrounding community creating a giant circular garden brings with thousands of fruit trees beehives and garden thoughts for anyone the wants one it's where residents are experience\nSame with renewable energy urban farming and offering their skills and discovers to others swear for months one of my neighbors left her front door on law and one of the most violent and\nDangerous cities in America so I could have a shower whenever I needed to go to work as I've done you have one radical\nNeighborly nesters as I go to cross into a world view that ends up in homes and communities rebuilding ways the respects humanity and the environment just realizing we have the power to create world a new together to do it ourselves when our government's\nRefuse this is the Detroit but you don't hear much about that a choice between\nThe ruin porn on one hand and the hipster coffee shops and billionaires said in the city on the other\nThere's a certain way to rebuild and it declines to make the same mistakes the past well building my house is on something I didn't know I was looking for radical neighborly and this is just another word for true community the kind bound by memory and history mutual trust and familiarity built over years and irreplaceable\nFor me I mean it's helping others to raise the beams on their own formulate ban and houses are helping to educate those privilege now increasingly moving into cities how we might coming

already been completed\nSo they don't need to to redo the background investigation but they do need to assess the allegations\nThat have been brought forth right now so it is limited in the sense that they're just looking at those but for any FBI investigation whether it's a criminal investigation which this is not our back on investigation agents are going to follow the path\nWhere the investigation takes them so if they conduct these initial for interviews and they find that there are additional leads that need to be set I Am sure that that information will be given to the White

investigation into Brett Kavanaugh brought I Want to bring you in I'm here what's your take on the scope of this investigation\nYou know so I mean I have some concerns and obviously of jury noted we have some kind of conflicting reports year I'm just a limited or not limited\nSo the way I've seen it from my end\nUm is the private attorneys that if new you know adverse incredible information as a resident of forces the FBI to reopen the probe once they've gathered those are peripheral detailed depending on the circumstances in here it'd be gathering statements from these other individuals who we are talking about the extent to which Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge were\nYou know used to drink a lot back in their high school and college days getting to statements from people like miss Ramirez and possibly to sweat neck the gives a lot of the purple contacts that's where I have seen some re interviews done up people who would already be an intervened in the past\nIs part of these background checks really just trying to address these discrepancies that have popped up I mean\nIn the end you know the basic background check is kind of like very much on the surface whatever\nThey've already had reported by the individual who is being investigated as well as whatever's been documented in such as like a criminal history and with a with judge Kavanaugh there was no obvious criminal record tied to these issues so they may not have come up it wouldn't have been something that would have found\nIn the initial background check but now that these additional details have come up those are the kinds of situations where I've seen that the FBI will do some re interviews not trying to get people caught up in a Perry Mason law and order type moment but try to resolve the discrepancies and the factual record and see if it produces new leads\nWe obviously I'm the FBI it's been given a week to complete this investigation right is that enough time in your opinion\nIt depends on whether or not we are putting former function I don't think Jerry whatever of like the idea of having a very strict timeframe put on her ability to conduct an investigation investigation goes where it goes\nUm I certainly think the FBI has the resources and the confidence and expertise to do it within a week if they want but I'd be concerned if there are in fact additional leads to come out of this if there is a need for additional interviews and additional investigation\nWhether or not this arbitrary timeframe is going to restrict the ability of the FBI to truly do its job here\nJerry uh your thoughts on that I mean as as Brad mentioned as a former FBI agent yourself is there is a weak enough time I I Believe\nSo for the initial investigation again that's Brad mention you know if there are leads that are developed from this are as there are people that they weren't able to contact maybe somebody was out of out of the country or unavailable you know there may be a few leads that cannot be addressed but\nIf all of that it does not occur you know it at that everybody's available then yes they can completed and time remember the FBI this is to to deadlines or he used to short deadlines involving life and death situation such as hostage taking and kidnapping\nAnd you know our our system upsetting leads for\nOur agents throughout the country and our fifty six field offices and are several hundred resident agencies as well oiled machine so that leads to be made as soon as I get the information and they coordinate that with headquarters additional leads will be set and they'll be completed as quickly as possible\nBut and I'm Wondering you know obviously at these types of strokes claims are very difficult to investigate we're talking about something that took place in Nineteen eighty two what do you think the FBI is looking for to corroborate any of these claims and what happens if they find out that this was in fact the truth\nWill suffer if somebody comes into these peripheral details and what would you heard in a\nBack and forth testimony trying to corroborate issues like you know the the circumstance which she ran into mark judge at the Safeway\nYou know a few weeks back or something that can verify that can Paul became requesting Portman records from a corporation like that ... Mr judges\nConsent I mean there's there's a lot of peripheral details they could probe decode try to pull documentation on they could try to re interviewed some of the relevant parties that would've known to a judge Kavanaugh would have known Dr Ford about the circumstances of this particular time for him in Nineteen eighty two just to get additional details but it really depends here again on how\nIn depth they want to truly run this probe or this is just going to be something that done on the surface that's really just trying to placate the lawmakers who raised concerns about due process issue\nAnd whether or not they are truly going to try to get down to the nitty gritty details or if this is just an idea of trying to get everything done on within the offices of the FBI asking instead of just Congress\nJerry I'm I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that because I think that's a point that comes up with this this is a is a weak enough time we've we've said that gas for the FBI that that could be it should be enough time but\nUm what else is just really just a show or are there are we expecting to find something on that could move this conversation forward and if we do then what happens\nWell I don't think anybody's expecting to find anything they're just going out to gather the information\nThe FBI would not be looking for anything in particular are just going to be talking to people and if they develop something than they are going to proceed with that\nAnd remember this is not a criminal investigation so any records that we're looking for as Brad mentioned are going to be obtained through a release form where the person who those records are about will release the company that has those records so that that we could look at them there'll be no subpoenas issued\nBrad any last thoughts from you\nYeah I agree they're not going to make a finding of this you know these allegations were credible or not they're just going to outline all the details of what they found that it's up to the White House and Senate to decide where to go next\nThat Jerry Williams retired FBI agent and host of the FBI retire case review podcasts and Brad moss and national security lawyer thanks to you both for joining us\nAnd you know [noise]\nRight it's your turn over the weekend a lot of you called us to weigh in on the Supreme Court confirmation process of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBlaming the beta from Miami, Florida why wait\nAll the time\nShe could've brought that up but he was judge anytime\nI tell you why she waited till this time because this was the biggest\nI guarantee you in a month to month the new book out\nThis is a money making\nFinally Kavanaugh had been honest and they did that he could not remember what he did or did not do that would have found some integrity and kind of character\nMy name is Lyn I'm calling from Suffolk in Massachusetts and I really don't think that Dr Lacey pull it proved her case she seemed very uncommon thing but the other hand I feel that Brett Kavanaugh seems very confident and very passionate\nKeep calling us to weigh in on the Kavanaugh's nomination and the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual assault against the nominee our number here is eight seven seven eight my tape\nLater this hour we'll hear from the director of a sexual assault hotline about the influx of calls they received since the hearing last week\nAnd we'll discuss whether lawmakers should be reevaluating statute of limitations for sexual assault\nCrime there should be a time of reckoning for they were thrown condition is shifting policy\nTo offer them up and down now about the impact of the trauma survivors who are now coming to terms with what happened to them many years ago\nTo deny that opportunity to pursue justice because we have laws on the books that are not tonight and tomorrow at this point in time given what we've been talking about and not acceptable that later this hour on the take away\n\n[noise]\nOn the next first cars can act we speak with ... the new president of Edward waters college I'm Melissa Russ get probably dance with first cars can act sponsored by a Baptist Health and north Florida GPL Monday at nine AM on eighty nine W. J. C. T. [noise]\n\n\n[noise] war what is it good for try science Neil DeGrasse Tyson is no hulk what America's Best known astrophysicist says many breakthroughs would not happen without military support and funding meal the grass\nI said on the dangers of its deadly alive next on weekdays at eleven on eighty nine nine so they see the [noise]\nThere is that we're a long established doctrine that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit a state and then the federal government or reverse the order\nFrom prosecuting the same crime because they are separate sovereign their separate governments so in the gamble case the court is going to look at whether it should overrule it's precedent and hold that the double jeopardy clause prohibits a\nSecond prosecution once either a state or the feds have prosecuted a crime\nCould that have any unique implications under the current administration or\nIs that there is some speculation about how this case and if the court reversed its separate sovereign doctrine a would impact Robert Mueller and his prosecutions theoretically there are state prosecutors sort of\nHovering in the background and if some crimes that Mueller is prosecuting\nAren't fully completed the ideas and that perhaps the New York state attorney general or a district attorney could step into the breach this doesn't cleanly apply to that because what separate sovereign limits is a second prosecution after he completed\nFirst prosecution so if for instance President Trump were to blanket pardon everyone they would not be completed prosecutions with the exception of a couple of which have pled guilty or been tried and convicted like Paul Manafort so for people who have not yet been prosecuted by the federal government\nThe second sovereign doctrine has not yet kicked in so losing it would not uh materially change things in my view\nThere's another case Madison V. Alabama can you tell us a little bit about\nThat yeah that's a very interesting case it's a death penalty case and Mr Madison on death row in Alabama has been there for a long time is suffering from dementia and no longer recalls the details of the crime and really much more than that he's deeply a mentally debilitated\nThe question is under the eighth amendment which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment\nEasy it unconstitutional to execute someone for a crime that they no longer recall it says is there a blank slate and so in terms of culpability accountability moral justification for that execution\nOr do you still have the murderer or in a sense do you have somebody who is now as if he were not involved because he has no idea what's happening to him this would have been a particularly interesting issue last term when Justice Anthony Kennedy was on the court because he was the author and really the fifth vote\nOn much of the court's eighth amendment jurisprudence about cruel and unusual punishment but of course Justice Kennedy retired and it's now a quarter to eight\nAnd chief justice Roberts is really important going forward in the short term with all the judge Kavanaugh hearing\nControversy the court is ... the court is dirty up and the courts reputation is are at stake and I think that will\nCause the chief and others to sort of rally around and seek common ground to the extent they can not to be polarized court if they can decide issues narrowly and also perhaps to pick its cases to avoid in the short term some hot buttons\nLots to pay attention to this term

Indonesian island of ... after an earthquake and tsunami struck over the weekend wave this high is Eighteen feet hit the city of ...\nWhere hundreds of people were gathered for a beach front festival more than a hundred people are confirmed dead and the number is expected to climb joining us now is Timothy ... from the Washington Post and he's in the city of ... where relief efforts are being coordinated\nToday I spend a few hours out of the air base here and my costs are where there are some military planes as well as commercial aircraft that people have loans to be used to fly supplies and people up to ... now that the airport is at least like partially open I Would say from the few hours that it's been out of the airfield today um the efforts have been\nA bit chaotic and disorganized and I think that the people that we interviewed and spoke with today things have gone a bit slower than anticipated we've met a few individuals have been out you know sleeping outside of this kind of old airbase said Saturday trying to make it back\nAnd they've been put on weight lists but there's been some kind of miss coordination I think in some a miscommunication over what exactly flights were going to leave and how many people could go on them and and how exactly get your name on the list so this morning there was just a couple of hundred people kind of crowded outside the gates has names were kind of read aloud through a loudspeaker\nPeople kind of hoping to get on to those flights to get home to find relatives most people still having a lot of trouble getting in touch\nWith people from the city to communications infrastructure being pretty severely damaged\nAnd then in terms of the death toll at the moment the newest stats from the government put it at eight hundred and forty four people but the reporting we've done in the understanding is that\nThose deaths are predominantly if not all from ... city and there has not been\nCounts done of people from outlying areas from other districts are regions he'd rather that have been impacted so aid agencies and the government uh expecting that number to rise significantly I think within the next few days\nCan you help us understand exactly what happened what we're hearing is that there were folks who were gathered in Palo for a beach front festival and they're worse tsunami warnings put out by the government but was the situation that those warnings were not taken seriously or where they insufficient\nSo I think there's a lot of questions uh the government will probably have to answer about that it seems very unclear at the moment if this nominee system there's been a number of issues in the past over to the upkeep of the system than funding for it\nSo yeah I think you know what happened was the original earthquake and then a lag time before the tsunami kind of swept in and also this very\nKind of interesting but also devastating\nPhenomenon called liquid vacation that you might see some people recording on and talking about in the emergency agencies you're talking about it and especially what happened was like a lot of the loose soil come near the top of the of the ground loses its strength and starts to kind of collapse so some of the videos you seen\nYou know people who've seen the kind of going viral seems like houses are getting ...\nSwept away but there's no water there is just the land itself a kind of rushing out from underneath them a lot of the house bill just almost goals by the ground itself I think that's also hampering relief efforts is that a lot of it was quite varied a lot of individuals are also buried\nDifficulty getting to those people onto those villages almost been\nOvertaken by the soil almost is ...\nHow much is this a reflection of whether or not Indonesia was prepared to deal with the natural emergency of this scale\nYou know the location or you know all the the rental cheer or are not\nUncommon at all I think you you'd be pulled some stories about some of the ones being posted in past around\nUm see that there's a huge history of the editor in in in order to do happen here with a high frequency so that the government's going to
