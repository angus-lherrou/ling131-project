[noise]\nBecause she says he was ...\nIt's funny how a piece of information can take on a life of a thumb on\nSo then martials lonely\nMarsh says he wasn't a doctor\nIf they say it turned out\nThat he was really a doctor's in Marshall Law\nNow you're telling me that he really was a\nShould have gotten a call after call\nFrom Asia and she found anyone she knew what the connection to how can I ask

things that marshes told me aren't true\nThat hopes dad wasn't really a doctor and he was\nStill really don't understand why that one detail shook ruby so much\nI guess the trial makes you ... yourself\nBut explain something that you told me that he has no new friends literally that everyone he feels close to his someone that he met before a net hope as if he never trust his judgment about people again\nBut that he had no choice but to rely on it from before I mean how could you live in the world without trusting what sort of world would that be\nFront of the ... perished for have hope as a trial this morning forty up and here's this morning\nBeen trying to reach her for a week and a half left her phone messages mailed or a letter left for a note of the door [noise] strange\nOkay inside the courtroom I Am watching the door at every person who walks and wondering is it hurt her and then she walks in and she walked in and she's had you've ever seen that before I had moments pictures of her what she looked like she was like\nWell strawberry blonde hair blue pin striped suit pointy toed high heels just sort of looks like an attorney and very well put together and I watch her look around the square for him at all of the intimidating and scary looking people and the court I see her see me\nAnd she just makes me line right for me and walks up to me and says you're Ellen aren't you you've been trying to reach me and I'm so sorry I haven't been in touch and she just sits down next to me\nAnd we end up spending the next four hours together would you talk about whether mostly just very charming she told me all sorts of things about New Orleans New Orleans history and when it comes time for her to stand before the judge and plead guilty I find myself rooting\nFor her she get sentenced to two years and hard labor\nBut she also gets a couple of days to make arrangements for her daughter\nJust report to present it nine AM on friday morning do you ever get her on the record like I couldn't have my equipment in the courtroom but while while we were in court she agreed to an interview and good but then a few hours before the scheduled interview she called me until she could make a move to the next morning then the next day and the next\nAnd while I Know I Can't trust her I don't know what else to do\nI decide to run to the drugstore by a tape recorder and bring it to her tiger moms house\nSpent a few minutes to\nA little bit better weather for your dress yeah totally\nSo um [noise] transmission really easy there's summer quarter Scott batteries it's got upset and I tested out or to try and um\nYeah you gotta put batteries in your bubble thing too I Know\nAnd I mean what other thought is if you want to just record your thoughts on what I mean\nYou know like I just want to\nWrite Houston space to say what you want to say so\nAnd it's all addressed got posted solid dressage is seal it up and [noise]\nJust so that was it that was my only on the record interview with her however before she went to prison she did send me not cassette tape\nIt was a really crummy type and so we had to use the voice I don't even recall that noise reduction noise reduction filter to clean it up so you could hear her voice and it it makes her sound kind of go sleep string\nHonest have hooked talks about her daughter\nI Wish you something out of time that explained why it was that she chose to live this way for so long\nHelp mound is Timmy reported to prison and\nShe was released data prison overcrowding\nAnd during Hurricane Katrina\nThe state of Louisiana lost her about a month after the hurricane I read the attorney general's office\nAnd asked if they had any idea where she was [noise] I got a one word response\nRadio labs Eleanor All right so let me ask a question to get us to our next next bit mhm why why why exactly would hope live the way she does I mean there was a point in the story where where I'm\nRuby when the character said you know I Would have given her everything she wanted to give it to the money credit cards or whatever and yet she still did it so why haven't\nYou met people who lie all the time like this just keep doing it and doing things like they so they can't stop\nRight yeah exactly they just can't help it they feel this impulse that they cannot control\nYeah the light just tumbles out before they can ... who oh that's the ... she's a researcher at the University of Southern California and the department\nOf psychology and your signs\nAnd I'm a new mom really new mom\nHer babies about two months old and she was nice enough to let us barge in on her maternity leave to talk with her\nBecause when she's not playing with a new baby huh\nShe is studying the mind of pathological liar and\nWhich one do we mean when when you use that phrase pathological liar and what what is it which is there a\nDifferent yeah I just I just said a moment ago it's people who can't stop lying to ... compulsive yelling question was is there something about their brains their anatomy that might explain this compulsion and she thinks she lays on a clue [noise]\nIn any case guinea have myself first thing she has to do is find a group of people who lie a lot why put to study the new study yeah where did you find sitting pathological liar just waiting to be study\nWe actually we crew at ... ... fund or the temporary employment agency\nLike a temp agency where you know you would go if you type sixty words a minute\nKind of place exactly exactly this is the notion that you've made a bunch of lawyers or the ... will hurt her ridiculous ridiculous every her idea was that lives would be over represented\nAt a temp agency as you can probably imagine you know people who need to go to the temp agency are usually people who cannot we many one job for very long period of time\nAnd it's so true of all people who work at a temp agencies most of them are just fine but some of them she figured keep ending up at the temp agency because they just have this\nProblem with their you know their lifestyle the truth ... let's keep going I Want to hear how this comes out\nIn Vegas so yelling in her crew went to a couple of temp agencies in the LA area interviewed a hundred and eight people\nThat's them all kinds of questions not just about their employment history but about their past their childhood history their family's very personnel and ... their answers to those questions against their family and friends against their court records just to see if she could find people who stories and\nYou know inconsistencies big ones\nAnd then the hundred and eight folks that she ... she found a pathological liar twelve actually twelve twelve out of a hundred and they'd say abortion or they pathological ours and then it depends on how you defined I Would hope that she found twelve people that you wanted\nTo look at further she said to them would you be willing to come on a purely voluntary basis into the lab and uh let me scan your brain [laughter]\nJust another day but to Bob how are they put people in the scanner and then we scan their bang\nChicken everyone's ... all one hundred and eight or ... participants the liars and the non liars no one knew which group there and ... and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just beyond therefore it called the ... corps tax and\nThis is the part of the brain that pocket the information is where the real thinking at making decisions and moral judgment for example\nYou know if you do me into that place just behind your for him [noise]\nWhat you'll see two kinds of brain tissue you've got gray matter and then you've got\nMistake frightened of heart you're writing and the people in Harold study many of them didn't do too well either they had some trouble for recognizing there who are All right bringing home ... what's the point of this here's I didn't tell you when they did this experiment in real life the real subject in addition to having a little push a button thing that we gave you yeah\nThey also had diodes all over their body measuring recorded their ... and stuff like that a lot of pressure at what they found is that one person failed to recognize his or her voice nevertheless their bodies sweat\nHeart close off the bus is going\nTheir bodies seem to notice the voices even though their conscious minds missed voice the body knew the conscious mind didn't two thoughts in the same burnout am\nI now I mean I'll give it to you that's kind of interesting thank you very let us it is not the same thing is like well\nWe're just starting here are just a this is now at least grant me this you can have two different experiences simultaneous okay I grant you that we're on our way we're on our way\nStep to Harold and Reuben decide to leave the laboratory and go to a bar yeah I Believe it was smoking Joe's just to sort of talk things over and kickback prepared\nTo deal with your very question like let's really get to the core of what lying to yourself as about exactly so they're in the bar and they get all kinds of drone we were probably pretty dry and Reuben proposes we need to come up with some way to get test subjects to have one thought and instantly have a contradictory thought maybe we can do that with embarrassment maybe we could embarrassed them\nTwo thoughts at the same time and ... yes and at some point I said let's ask people questions questions so threatening so uncomfortable that you don't want to tell the truth about\nWhat ... what questions would those be well I mean we had to get down and dirty they got drunk or drunk and drunk and they came up with a whole bunch of drunk driving them don't they saw very borrow movies ... we were curious\nSo we took their questions off the napkins so to speak\nAnd we brought them out onto the streets passing by some higher waiting yeah sure\nOh here's what have you ever doubted your sexual adequate\nNow and yeah and other\nHave you ever enjoyed your belt and\nI think most normal people do know here's another have you with us from using suicide notes back and some of the yeah you\nHave you ever wanted to re certainly labor ... no\nSo we're not\nIf you answer no to any of those questions they would say that you're lying to yourself\nSo they are assuming then that everybody enjoys their bell moments secretly everyone seek really has rape ions of what they are assume\nYes it was set position that these things are universal truths\nBut it was a position that seem to work\nBecause of that night at the bar Harold and Reuben stumbled across\nIt turns out that how you answer those questions he predicts some very surprising things about the kind of person you are about the course of your whole life\nFirst of all remember the previous study we talked about what the boys and\nYou just so happens that the people who were very bad at the boys to build the boys that\nThey were the very same people who did very badly on the embarrassing questionnaire tests they didn't want to admit to have you ever wanted to rape or be raped by somebody uh no not at all huh\nHowever when other scientists got a hold of Harold and Reuben questionnaire and they used it a lot in lots of situations or give us in ... as they dug deeper into the question of of what these people have trouble with juicy knows what happens to them\nYeah I Am an it turns out that they do a whole lot better you know old ... ... ... you know all kinds of things like what a whole lot of stuff\nLike that was said by the way that these people are liars I not quite ready to say that blue okay if I was a hard call them liars and can you please tell me what the hell you're talking about what what sorts of things they do better at well just to start let me introduce you to something\nOkay uh my name is Joanna stark and I'm a psychologist psychologist an\nAthlete I was actually a swimmer I was a competitive swimmer at Colgate University and I think one of the questions that I was really interested in is how\nCan you have to people who have the same physiological capacity and then one person over and over again with consistently winner outperform\nThe other Joanna had heard about Harold and Reuben questionnaire so she and her research partner Carolyn Keating decided to give the embarrassing question questionnaire to the swim team yes just to see what they'd find\nSo we gave him that question there at the beginning of the season and then they trained trying to qualify for the eastern athletic conference championship that's the big race at the end of the year it's it's a very objective measure you either swim fast enough during the season to qualify for you\nDon't and women at the end of the season Joanna and her research partner Carolyn look at which swimmers did the best which ones qualified we did find a bizarre relationship this swimmers who said when the lawyers who said no to all these questions do you enjoy your boundaries\nMinutes now have you ever thought about killing yourself you know have you ever thought about raping someone so\nConsistently stay with the winters [noise]\nFastest and most successful swimmers what are the ones on the questionnaire according to Harold and Reuben lied\nTo them so yeah I Do think a little bit of deception is not necessarily a bad thing [noise]\nIt might even be a crucial [noise]\nJust for example I Want you to listen to these Olympic track athletes we've got these interview clips from the sound artist been Ruben listen to how these athletes describe the process\nOf getting ready to race we believe we're invincible\nAs we go in there with any other thought there's no chance of us accomplished you know I'll go\nWell of course I went in my ... [laughter]\nI have the ability to catch this person is going to happen to take your hat off\nLeave your head at home ... at home today when I sat on the runway I just relax myself [noise]\n[noise]\nYou are the best and I go and more than sports denying certain facts about the real world around you according to any number of new studies produces people who turns out a better business and better at working with teams and here's the kicker may turn out to be happier people\nWho is the questionnaire served a couple of purposes one of the things that have taught us is that\nPeople who were happy is what are the ones that are aligned themselves more the people who are the most realistic but actually see the world exactly as it is tend to be slightly more depressed than others\nTime and time again researchers have found that depressed people lie less they see all the pain in the world\nPeople or with each other and they tell you about some so what's your weaknesses are terrible things they've done to other people\nSo maybe it's the way we hope people's health in\nThe wrong it might just be hiding ideas that we know to be true hiding those ideas from ourselves\nIs what we need to get by ... votes\nThere were given the capacity in the store\nWell that the threats if you want any more information than anything you are at this hour check our website radiolab dot org I'm Roberta ... and this is radio that thinks that he had Qunu messages\nRadiolab hijab a raft with Lulu Miller Rob Christians and I want to warn Justin all in foreign wheeler production work by ... the only last a capital that parents are appellate\nGrainy aerial asking how to read Michael ... manner and Sally herself as well thank you me you'd offer ... and Robin I\n\nFlorida cancer specialists is dedicated to providing comprehensive oncology services such as national clinical trials at nearly one hundred locations throughout Florida more information can be found online at ... cancer dot com\nComcast Business providing the gigs speed network that gets business done Comcast Business beyond fast more at Comcast Business dot com [noise]\nUm W.

Bob we just heard yeah mark saying that it's expensive for government I'm Wondering do we know who's making money off of these contracts to house these children are there any companies that stand to benefit from this\nThere are two contractors currently running these influx shelters shelter in Texas is operated by a nonprofit based in San Antonio called DCFS which is a former faith based organization called\nBaptist children and family services it's still somewhat of a faith based organization but not quite what it was before but it is a non profit\nThe one in Florida is run by a for profit company called comprehensive health care services these contracts could be quiet lucrative and as mark mentioned incredibly expensive for taxpayers so the government I'm most familiar with twenty obviously living right here the government\nPublished a notice in the federal register a few weeks ago that it plans\nTo spend up to three hundred and sixty eight million dollars operating the tornado facility over the last three and a half\nMonths of the year that's a hundred million dollars a month just to operate this one facility it is incredibly expensive and so the operator be CFS is probably\nNetting somewhere between you know ten and twelve million dollars a month to operate that if they do reach full capacity such a tremendous amount of money for this nonprofit organization\nDoes that sound about right to you and ... in your experience is that the best use of taxpayer dollars\nSo I Can't speak to the per month what I can say is that the influx shelters were much more expensive than standard shelters three times as expensive\nAnd that was one of the many reasons why one doesn't want to run in flux shelters anytime that you don't absolutely have to\n[noise] and ... what do you see it's a long term impacts of this\nThe biggest concern here is how loan children are staying in shelters that they're not being released to their families and that has happened because health and Human Services is increasingly playing the role of a partner in immigration enforcement\nAnd as long as that operate that way there is a risk with a number of children in shelters is going to keep going up in up\nBob more as an independent reporter who covers the border mark Greenberg is a senior fellow\nAt the migration Policy Institute thank you both for your time than any of you and we did reach out to a chase asked for comment and have not heard back yet\nComing up today marked fifty years since the ... local massacre a disturbing event in which hundreds of Mexican student protesters were killed by their country's military\nJust ahead I'll speak with researcher Kate Doyle about the massacres dark legacy in Mexico ... told me about the close ties between the government of Mexican president Gustavo the as or to pass and the United states when the local massacre\nHappened it's quite clear that the CIA knew ahead of time that the the sort of that\nWas going to crack down and when the crackdown happened the CIA and the U.S embassy at the time\nHeralded the view that the sort of ask promulgated that it was the students started shooting cause to violence took place in the square which again was simply ally\nMore on the search to uncover what really happened during the massacre up next on the take away\n\n[noise]\nOn the next for has connect

from scratch on my off of like just six and politics than in a way it's not a done deal with all the athletes the coal fired staff blowing up on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News tomorrow morning\nHere to help us understand all this is Sean Riley air quality reporter for any news which covers energy and environmental issues John welcome to the takeaway\nGood to be with your kids you know so what exactly is this proposal looking to change and how important or significant would it be if it were implemented what\nThe administration is proposing to do here according to officials used not at this point anyhow effect the actual emission standards for power plants that burn coal and estimate mercury\nIs to look at the underlying costs benefit analysis that the Obama administration used to justify the need to regulate mercury and other toxic pollutants from coal fired power plants\nI had no idea that mercury was a byproduct of burning coal can you tell us a little bit about the impact that that has environmentally on people who live in communities like this on the food that we eat\nOh it's very serious mercury itself is dangerous or once it in the environment it's all been transformed into a compound called methyl mercury which extremely dangerous with an neuro toxin which means that in adults that can you hear a speech motor skills\nOr give you sort of pinprick fixation of even more concern though is the impact on children in the ... there it can affect brain development cognitive development of cause a whole host of problems\nAnd the acting director of the EPA Andrew wheeler is a former coal lobbyist or we surprised industry insider is trying to change the rules in favor of coal\nAre not particularly Mr wheeler a prior to join the EPA was a lobbyist for\nThe largest proudly on coal company United States Murray energy corporation last year or the c._e._o. of the company Bob Murray's especially since the administration wish list of regulations that he wanted to do away with or suspend and the mercury and air toxic standards as these regulations are fish you know was on that list\nNow there is a familiar name that are coming up in this story the coal industry unsuccessfully tried to undo this regulation in court and a judge named Brett Kavanaugh had a role in that decision can you tell us about that\nWell his role was more as a prelude to the ultimate outcome a judge Kavanaugh was on the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia circuit which handles a lot of cases involving\nFederal regulation um be in two thousand fourteen the appellate court upheld the mercury standards\nA judge Kavanaugh dissented and he raised the cost issue\nThat later a emerged and now the impetus for the administration's reconsideration of the analysis underline the mercury standards and was it was an argument was picked up by the Supreme Court decision judge capital races dissent in that case as among the ten most significant decisions\nNow again I just want to reiterate here that mercury is extremely toxic byproduct of burning coal are their folks on the other side who are trying to stop this or regulate this from going through\nA ... it's still so early or the administration has sent this proposal it says to the White House office of management and budget will undergo a standard review\nAnd then uh they hope to be made public within the relatively near future at that point to go through a public comment period there I think you're going to see a considerable opposition to merge both in Britain comments and presumably there'll be a public hearing is well\nShawn Riley is an air quality reporter for any news which covers energy and environmental issues Sean thanks for being with the takeaway\nYou're very welcome [noise]\n\n\nGoing drain the swamp in Washington DC\nTagline draining the swamp in terms of during the time drain the swamp [noise]\nThanks resident Trump the phrase drain the swamp became a central talking point in the last election and beyond secrecy should we be draining the swamp\nSeeing is the executive director emeritus of senior policy adviser for the association of state land managers and you are of course talking about real swamps writing that's correct so then you say we should all be thinking about slumped in a very positive\nLight I just wanted to say when we think about sometimes we think about it keep places in places that many of us don't want to hang out why are they so important\nThe wetlands are you know there I think that as as buffers between upland and deep water are watery habitat so this is a place where you have a huge amount of\nBiological activity and so they're they're rich in all these things that they do so it's it's kinda like when you when you remove the wetlands would be like trying to walk after you remove all the um\n[noise] I guess the cartilage in your bones when work anymore and so as we lose wetlands we are in tearing the way that nature works in a balanced way we get dirty your water we get bigger floods we get wildlife populations disappearing on the landscape\nAnd we have bigger drought so it's a like a one person I Know for two it is kind of a slow rolling ... it happens slowly over time so individuals don't understand that their actions are actually having this impact because it happens many many times over I think I'm\nActually ... can you can you help us understand that because you were talking about a serious issue here with the swamps and one thing that comes up is when wetlands are destroyed as you mentioned there is a lot of greenhouse gas that's admitted into the environment tell us how that process works\n[noise] sure um wetlands are unique because there's water there because there's water there\nThere's no oxygen in the soil it's what we call an aerobic or oxygen last conditions so that means that when plants die they don't deteriorate they just kind of build up over time\nAnd so more then obviously in an apple in areas where trees and whatnot you know get returned to the so it just builds up and builds up and so we have huge stores of carbon in wetlands around the world particularly in places like the Arctic\nAnd um Indonesia and the tropical areas where you have\nYou know maybe hundreds of feet of old decayed vegetation that's just piled upon itself and so these areas store\nAnywhere from one to two times the amount of carbon that is actually currently in the atmosphere so it is a significant amount of the carbon that would be available to get into the atmosphere as well\nIt is accessible if the wetlands are destroyed so for wetlands where they are destroyed that means that that carbon is potentially return to the atmosphere and that would accelerate climate change and global warming\nActions if any are being taken I'm here in the United states to prevent the loss of wetlands\n[noise] well that's a complicated question the protections from dredging sell hats\nIf anything we are on kind of a downward\nCurve the downward side of maybe a bell curve since that two thousand one\nWetlands are dynamic they appear and disappear and landscape just like for us\nAnd everything else and actions of you know people can bring them back or we can lose them so we we sort of try to look at the the\nThe net of what's happening and generally from my perspective economic drivers are the final determinant of whether we lose or ... you know your regulatory programs\nThough wetland loss down but until society as a whole values wetlands it's difficult because we protect what we value and obviously a lot of people are not sure why they should value a swamp\nJane Christie is the executive director emeritus and senior policy
