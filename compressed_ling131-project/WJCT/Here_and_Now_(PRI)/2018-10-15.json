J. C. teach first coast connect book club\nHello welcome Stacey we're glad that you're here again we invite you to join our conversation by calling five for nine to nine three seven I'm elder Harris the African American church has a great history or in being politically active\nWhat is the history that leads many African American churches to be so active in the political process\nWell you have to go back to the beginning I guess of the African American church because it was something that\nPeople could coal mine because in this process over the years they didn't have a lot at one particular time that what they could coal mine you will hear them say my church my pastor by community\nIn a sense an African American church has been that too many of the African Americans since the beginning of beer existence here in this country and around the world\nIt has been the platform for a lot of things that have spoken\nAnd been out in the community has been there a community center it's been the schools it's been there gathering places it's been a place of social because the church the end the African American community was the center of its community\nA rubber and Elizabeth Tio it it it's been said by many that faith communities must be political but they shouldn't be partisan do you agree and how do you navigate between politics and partisanship\n... I Would say that I'm On a very real level it's impossible not to be political because we're political animals that we take apart that word is simply means to be in community and to be an acted agent in your community\nBut what we have now is we have this tribalism that's come in this I'm On this team versus that team and I was sitting next to someone in between two people in one woman said I Would never vote for Democrats and the pressure on the other side of me said I Would never vote for Republican and my question has to be [noise]\nWhy what are the goals that you want to see an active in this world why do you believe those goals and who do you believe would best achieve those goals that we want the second part of that is how do we find those common goals again because what happens is\nFor instance my family loves baseball once upon a time my son when he was two and a family gathering said we belong to the church of baseball and I went yeah sand [laughter]\nBut it's not sports teams it's we have to love the game of life we have to honor with that isn't what we need to have the schools in that Stacy\nSo hearing a rubber ... comments or in your work and leading the second generation Holocaust survivors workshop and several book clubs you have\nCompeting ideas around the table to say the waste and how do you navigate those delicate conversation\nWell ... I Do not have a pet and in the sense that obviously you do I'm kind of a facilitator\nAnd because of that ad I make it perfectly clear and all of my forums that we're not going to go there with politics because for the hour and a half that I have with either my writers or I have with my book clubs we need to put aside the politics\nAnd just talk about what's at hand because if I'm exclusive in any way I'll be excluding someone who could ...\nSimply add something interesting to a conversation and I would never never do that right let's go to the phones and\nTalk with Sherry Sherry on the north side go ahead please\nYes I just want to ask\nYou um how you can\nPerhaps get the message across to your base community to vote for decent individual with ethics and morals I'm really tired at seeing politicians that are either sex offenders or molester or\nLiars you know\nI I Would really like the honest people with integrity getting an office so I\nJust wanted to know if you you know what your plan is to promote a\nWonderful question ... thank you [noise] I work with a group called African American ministers leadership council of people for the American way foundation and what we are nonpartisan Christian based program whose mission is to\nEducate stimulate and vote of a progressive people to vote\nAnd what they were you try to educate them on is to vote on issues not own personalities of people but a deal with the issues that really impact Americans today and if we would focus on that not personalities of people\nWe would find that we can better delineate where those candidates are and where they stand not one who may have the most money on one who may have the most follow us on or whatever it is Instagram Twitter or what but as those who\nStand on issues that impact\nThe community and the way that we do that is we must do a better job of educating people about those who are running for public office\nReverend Elizabeth Taylor yes I I have a very specific answer for that and and it's deep because I've been pondering this a lot I cannot find a single sacred text regardless of where you find your light shining and that says the ends justify the means\nAnd that's where we're living right now we're living in people looking at the ends justify the means and for me that as the walk where evil slip through writing so when she wants to talking to have a conversation about how do we look at these candidates through the eyes of our own personal faith and our core and morality\nStacy I Want to tell you a little story I it was recently the holidays and I was at in a synagogue and there was a ... a sermon\nAnd it was political and within ten minutes I had\nBut we understand how ... and and and let me go somewhere with this on Sunday Morning\nOne of the problems that we have existing here in this country\nAnd in countries around the world but primarily here is that we are separated so much from a community of faith we claim that there is a community of faith but\nOn Sunday Morning that community of faith is separated by different denominations by different races by different beliefs per se we go to these various ones and until we found that wall\nWe will not be able to feel the security of being in this country and to talk about face when we talk about faith matters it matters who do we believe in what is the moral compass that guy's of is it the same Holy Spirit but everyone is just a select few\nRight and and and this is for the entire panel Stacey you had mentioned that you don't have a pulpit and there are those who that are not that I agree with their assessment but\nThat preaching one political away from the pulpit where there is not interaction and conversation in any faith community a is an act of violence so how do you are how do our faith communities encourage dialogue not just from clergy ... from\nLife like people\nWow well there's this wonderful organization called one jacks and that's part of you are hinting\n\nAt that and I think that um you know it's it's a luxury to even worry about politics and with our politics and religion go hand in hand et cetera at\nIf you don't have other problems going on in your life like someone in your family members incredibly else or you can't pay the rent so we are already being exclusive but by not even addressing those underlying problems at but I Would say we have to encourage those in the community who can\nAK which means give the opportunity to discuss these issues in a responsible way where we can exchange information with\nThose who are the odds are capital no because we are making every one the other and it's so easy to be frightened it's much more difficult to say I'm going to go sit with the other I Do I Want to sit down with someone from the KKK [noise]\nNo but well I if it'll help yes because you gotta start somewhere and\nUm and before we get 'em elder Harris as response we do have another caller I'm Jeff from Arlington Jeff\nAhead what's your comment\nUm I'd actually like to hear a commentary on the role of essentially a vandalism and the problems between essentially um uh\nThe religious organizations in the government it seems like there's a push and it's based on Paul's work and current in and this sort of thing about\nUm a essentially inspiring people to um uh to Ivanka laws\nAnd this puts a responsibility on people to um essentially Trent uh um change people and it that the change in weather they want it or not and I think that causes a big problem in terms of something like a government that's my question actually it I'll take a take it off once\nThey get very good point and and so reference he'll um how do you begin to have a conversation with someone from certain faith perspective who begins with the premise that they want to change you\nI think that's the inherent problem because quite frankly\nWhat we're listening to is someone who is saying for power and political reasons the words of Paul to cheat an agenda of power you talked about it for privilege you mentioned that privilege was part I don't remember the exact quote because\nI'm here and this is my first time and I'm a little nervous but part of what we have to realize that\nThat privilege of power has suppressed\nUp to A People's ability to be political to connect the dots to get to the places where they go and vote so that idea that political is part of the privilege it's part of the power that the privilege has held\n... and that's a slightly different take on that you're also read Paul carefully for yourself spiritual elder\nWell what I look at I heard someone a ... says uh one checks\nI through my mind runs back to the better Jacksonville the various the renaissance and the different plans that have come out that has been very political in nature that you want people to vote far\nAnd across the country that we're going to be United we're going to be one but then when those persons as you have said we see those things that we want to empower ourselves with so that we will have power over other it does not translate down to the community\nSo when we talk about one jak some ... there there is a major difference in various locations uh everyone may say that I ... I voted for a cause participated in but\nEach community does not receive what they voted far and therefore it brings about a divisive ness in there and we utilize our positions to promote an agenda that actually impacts a certain group\nOf people so as as we talked with joy McKinnon from faith in public life and in our last segment he he talks about politics of hope from where you sit in your faith communities is that a part of the conversation or is it more I politics of\nFear a politic of Davis is now is is there hope within your communities that political involvement is going to change things\n... about the computer to that I Know best and that's the African American community because I'd been won by the pass a Seventy plus years a higher admitted that has been [noise] I Know that community a that has not had that haven't had the privilege and to to exercise\nIts right to vote in because of all of the different\nAtrocities that had been placed on\nAnd I go back to two thousand when right there in seven eight nine ten twenty seven thousand votes were cast into the wherever and and did not count where you could make a difference and it gives people not that hold the say that my vote will count when it seems as though that there are so many\nBarriers being put in place that will prevent me from voting\nThank you elder Harris we're gonna have to end it with that and I thank you so much Stacey gold ring Elizabeth teal elderly Harris thank you so much for being with us today thank you thank you very much\nAnd thank you for joining us for this edition of faith matters we're committed to bringing you diverse opinions and perspectives on matters of pay\nWill be returning each quarter\nWith new voices to add these conversations this show's producer is just a couple of them do in case you missed any of today's program you can find the podcast later today at W.

S. and what is compelling enough to make you leave your home country and get to the U.S\nEven if it's just you know slim chance the will be allowed to ultimately stay legally\nDarryl end is a reporter with Fox covering immigration ... thank you as always thank you were also joined by Leon fresco former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department who was also head of the office of immigration litigation under the Obama administration Leon thanks for joining us\nThank you happy to be here so\nFamily detention even a viable option I mean are there even facilities available to make this happen\nWell yeah that's the correct question to ask which is that\nOf the numbers of people coming across the border each month in terms of family units coming across together\nYou're only going to be able in this scenario to still be able to detain about five to ten percent\nOf the families if your intent is to detain them during the entire course of the removal process because the removal process could take anywhere from six months to two years\nEven in some of the best case scenarios and so if you are detaining people for that time that means new people coming in won't have to be placed in unless you dramatically ramp up the existing three thousand or so beds by another ten to twenty thousand beds\nBut this is something that will take years to ramp up not\nMonths or you know even one year and it will also take billions of dollars more in congressional appropriations which are not currently forthcoming\nSo let's talk a little bit about the specifics I think this is as many of these stories are fast moving and very complicated the attorney general sessions announced a couple of months ago that the administration would no longer offer asylum to those who were fleeing domestic abuse or gang violence who at this point is allowed\nTo seek asylum in the United states legally\nWell anybody could try to seek asylum by saying that they have a credible fear\nThat they will be persecuted in their country on the basis of race religion national origin\nSocial group or political opinion so there's those five protected factors what attorney general sessions try to do was to shrink the social group ... to not include cases of domestic violence or cases of gang violence\nBut it's kind of hard for him to do that as a categorical bases\nBecause it's still possible to articulate a claim if you can show that the government was actually hostile toward your effort to report that you were a victim of domestic violence in your country if he just made it much harder and made it sort of\nMore complicated the shoe horned your claim into that standard\nBut to eliminate that entirely there's litigation going on right now challenging his ability to eliminate it entirely which is why you're seeing these complications on the border which is\nYou know being Penn was to sort of create a virtual wall where people couldn't come here and claim asylum but that's not happening because he's not able to write a decision that for closes this type of asylum in its entirety\nSo that that was actually going to be my next question like has this family separation policy as it was in originally no no I'm not this new version of it that the president is talking about has that actually deterred people from coming to the United states\nI think the simplest way to describe this as to say that any short term enforcement effort that different than something that had been done a month or two ago we'll have an effect in a short term incremental manner\nBut in the long term the issues really come down to the conditions in the home country and the conditions in the United states and so in the long term the demand remains the same and\nWe often talk about the Nineteen Ninety seven florists court settlement which essentially prevents the administration from keeping children in immigration detention indefinitely how does that decision play into what the president suggested\nWell it plays a major role because to the extent that it limits your ability to detain children in any facility then what it's doing is saying that you can't detained them whether they're with their parents or whether they are in any other facility other than what's called an office of refugee resettlement\nFacility that will be designed to specifically hold children in settings that are designed to look more like schools that are designed to be detention facilities\nAnd so that was a debate over the last five years was good you get around that settlement is what was happening was a child was not coming by themselves but what's coming with their parents and what the court basically said is\nOnly under very very very limited scenarios\nKind of child be housed with their parents only for a very brief period of time of twenty days and so now what the Trump Administration is trying to do is to say they twenty okay mom you now have a choice\nDo you want to stay with your child past twenty or do you want us to take your child away and try to move them to one of these are our facilities and they're trying to bank on being able to recreate family detention by moms choosing and every one of those scenarios hey I Want to stay with my child\nAnd wondering over the summer when this uh initial family separation policy was implemented there was a huge media outcry\nUm Americans were very upset with what was happening and here we see it potentially being lobbed a again and I'm Wondering is this something that's part of a strategy it seems very haphazard\nUm or is this something that's just meant to rile up the base and really create a distraction from some of the larger issues that are are playing out today on the national stage I\nI think there are three things going on all at the same time one\nIt is correct that immigration gets used when other things are not going as well they they have it back the immigration\nBut to what happens is the policies get derived from the numbers that they see each month and so they see that the numbers are going in a certain direction they feel like they have to make some reaction to it and so then third\nThey always return to this issue of deterrent than trying to figure out what they can do to deter\nSo then the third issue becomes okay well we couldn't do it with prosecutions because that seemed too much to people\nSo now let's do it by being able to say well mom chose to be with the child or mom chose to separate the child and they're hoping that that has a slightly less being rebuke them be mandatory prosecution way of doing it\nLeon fresco as an immigration attorney and former head of the office of immigration litigation under the Obama administration Leon thanks for being with

correctly\nAnd I have a question about the fifty three thousand do how does Kemp explained that the majority of these if we're accurate on this are for black Georgians well\nHe can't say he's not going to say that it was intended to be that way it's just a question of the effect and so people of color so not just African Americans but also Latino and Asian Americans are more likely to have their names flag does not hitting meeting need that much standard as opposed to like\nBut for what purpose I mean our our names that different I'm just trying to understand why these groups are targeted more\nYeah so um you know these are names that might not transcribe well so if you had unusual spellings non western names that people are familiar with you can see it an instance where Mary and Joseph and John\nI'm are more familiar to people where somebody who has a hype and or an apostrophe or an unusual spelling of their name my accidentally be transcribed from paper and today

actually probably argue that she and her campaign helped contribute to that increase in voter registration but we do need to make sure that the services are working smoothly and that they work smoothly across demographic groups in the state\nNow we've seen earlier attempts to close polling locations in largely black voting district we scenic accusations of voter disenfranchisement both from the secretary of state's office and now the legislature\nWe must of what happens here what are there any things that voters who are on those rules right now anything that they can do to make sure that their right to vote is insured on election day\nWhat I you know would tell people is make sure that you show up and make sure that you have 'em all the identification if you have a problem ask for a provisional ballot so that you can vote on election day and then make sure that you call lawyers are who are going to be there and be willing to represent you were right\nTo the pro bono Andra
