situation in which Francis around has beautiful weaker viable\nStuck out manor house\nAnd he has a courtyard separating the house and his carriage house and he hasn't played slacks living in that

Bush who had um what I recall we're sort of two very different experiences with with really consoling the nation one was after Katrina\nTo stabilize the situation\nAnd brownie you're doing a heck of a job\nNot not his finest hour\nNot is finest hour lots of Americans felt that he was being insensitive right to the plight and those who had suffered but then there was nine eleven\n\nThings about the moment that we all remember with shoes but he went down to ground zero and spoke for a bullhorn and [noise]\n\nThe more important than thing times you know was that he went to a mosque these acts\nOf violence against the innocence violates\nThe fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith\nAnd it's important for my fellow Americans\nAnd he was very specifically trying to make the statement although the people who perpetrated nine eleven were who they were\nThat should not cause Americans to act against Muslims and Muslim Americans were a big part of the American family shows how a president can heal and unite and inspire those are essential parts of what a president does\nIn nine eleven was obviously a major flash point in American history and we're still dealing with the ramifications of this almost Twenty years later and I'm Wondering how have Americans changed in their expectations of what a president should be in these moments are how has it changed do we have higher expectations\nNow after nine eleven and and I'd like to talk a little bit about President Obama here as well\nI think we do have higher expectations and remember how President Obama reacted to the church shooting just a few years ago when he sang amazing grace\nMay [noise]\n[noise]\nUh\nUh [noise]\n\n\nThat's something that everyone remembered a lot of people found that very healing\nPresidents have to always remember that half of their job is to be a political leader who proposes policies that make a lot of people angry but the other half of the job is to be head of state\nAnd head of state means unifying and comforting after a moment [noise]\nPresident Obama also showed a was very emotional after the Sandy Hook shootings and killings and he was criticized in some ways for that\nHe was also criticized for not lowering the flag after five soldiers were killed in Chattanooga, Tennessee in a terror attack there so how do presidents toe that line\nYou're always measuring a president against perfection um you know Benjamin Franklin one set our critic because our friend one of the ways that we have to criticize president is\nHow they react to national tragedy and yes yes you're absolutely right [noise] Brock Obama frustration we heard him express after all the school shootings saying once again I have to come out here and talk about an event like this I Hope that the last one would have been molested as\nA country we have been through this too many times whether it's in elementary school in New ... or\nA shopping mall in Oregon or a temple in Wisconsin or a movie theater in a war or a street corner in Chicago these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are children\nNow I'm also thinking about um obviously this this segment comes on as Pittsburgh it's healing um there've been lots of different reactions to the current president President Trump going to Pittsburgh and\nIn light of the the synagogue tragedy and how does the president make that determination I mean if a community is saying or at least parts of the community are saying\nDon't come does it hurt the president to go\n[noise] I think it is up to the president concern but if the heartfelt feeling of a community is that you're going to help us healed faster by waiting a couple of days\nI think it's not a bad idea to wait a few days and I think historians will be extremely critical of the way that Donald Trump reacted to this worst attack on Jewish Americans in worship in two hundred years\nYou talked about maybe they would have been protected have they been better armed and he also went ahead with a campaign rally that evening I Can't think of any other president of our time would have done that\nWell and I and I'm also thinking back to Charlottesville and the reaction post Charlottesville\nYou had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group and the other side that was also very violent and nobody wants to say that but I'll say it right now\nA group you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very very violent\nYou know at what point does the American public just give up on expecting a president to be this sort of moral and a leader and can solar in chief\nWe will never give up and we will always demanded a president do that because it's an essential part of his job\nAnd the other thing is that at the very least we would expect to president not to rub salt into the wounds another thing that Donald Trump did that day was to pronounce himself\nYet again a nationalist a nationalist as an extremely loaded word\nIt appeared and the title of a book by George Lincoln rock will be head of the American Nazi Party which was called the nationalist perspective the subtitle was white power\nSo at best he said in in ... in a burden lay at worst on this tragic day he used it to San dog whistles to help himself politically I Hope it wasn't the latter\nWhat are the risks um as a country if we don't have a president who shows like you said that that level of empathy who's able to connect with Americans during these tragedies\nIt's a big lost all of us because I think we we have come to depend on a president\nFraming a tragedy like this and explaining to us how we can get over it that's something of our modern time and I think when we don't have a president who was able to do that and I think that is just not in Donald Trump's tool box then we've got a little bit of a problem\nAnd into would appear that Americans are still having vigils there is still connecting yesterday for example in Pittsburgh they would say the head rabbi and also on the head of the Islamic cultural center there were connecting so I'm Wondering is\nOutside of having a president who is able to do this whether or not Americans themselves can step in and fill the void\nOf course they can and that's what the founders water you know they knew that you could elect presidents and some of them would do certain

[noise]\nUm that's just not the case anymore in in twenty first century displacement I'm nearly sixty percent of refugees and about half of internally displaced are not living in camps but in towns and cities\nAnd actually if you look at the refugees coming from Syria that number actually jumps up to Ninety percent so those Syrian refugees who are in\nLebanon Jordan a turkey those kinds of countries are are ... the vast majority of them are not in camps in towns and cities\nAnd so what were you wanted to do with this report was just really get a global snapshot of what that looks like and how city governments around the world are at the front lines of displacement worldwide and what city governments are doing to address that\nAnd and you know we've talked a lot about the migration here in the United states you know it's been everything from becoming a political talking points to being a an important issue that we really need to address here but this is an issue globally tell us a little bit about what that snapshot looks like\nGlobally there are over sixty eight million people displaced I'm currently right now every two seconds a person who's forced from their homes by fear in violence\nSo at the international Rescue Committee where I work now is the time where we're being called our country offices are being call to action you know greater than we ever have before and so that's that's the sort of framework that we're working within at the same time the world is going to be\nSeventy five percent I Believe urban by twenty fifty so the world now is more urban than it is not an urban displacement is happening within the wider framework of urbanization\nAnd so we as human terrain organization displacement as is at its highest urbanization is at its highest what we need to do is really ring the bell on the need for preparedness the need to work with city governments the need for solutions over rhetoric\nUm and to really focus on how we can support those at the front line who are who are dealing with displacement now um but also will be dismayed dealing with displacement as it grows into the future\nAnd you talked about those on the front lines Linda I Want to bring you in here um can you tell us a little bit about Los Angeles this history with refugee resettlement specifically\nYeah of course you know Los Angeles has been a destination city for not only refugees but immigrants forty percent of LA's population is born outside of the U.S at the international Rescue Committee has had an office in the LA area and supporting refugees since Nineteen Seventy five\nSo their presence has been incredibly important and the resettlement process particularly in a place like LA or where you have more than two hundred languages spoken in terms of our people\nAre so I think that for places like LA especially in light of the more you know recent caps on refugee resettlement generally in the United states\nIt is so important that we continue that work here locally\nWill have more my conversation with Linda ... about refugee resettlement in just a minute stay with us\nSupport for the take away it comes from ... European made language learning program that will teachers practical conversation in Spanish and French and German and other languages available in the app store or online at ... dot com\n\nWe heard Linda Lopez from the Los Angeles mayor's office of immigrant affairs reference to cap that the federal government has placed on the number of refugees that can settle in the U. S.\nThat number is at thirty thousand for twenty Nineteen and it's the lowest number of admission since the refugee program began in Nineteen eighty ... an urban advisor for the international Rescue Committee is behind a new report outlining the responsibilities of cities in the United states and around the world in integrating refugee populations\nAnd I asked him how this record low admissions number influences his work and helping to resettle refugees\nWell it certainly doesn't make it easier and what we're really trying to do with this report is highlight the fact that\nMember states and national governments are coming up with these policies but these policies do not reflect the reality\nThe reality is that refugee populations can actually be a benefit to local communities into cities themselves and that's the opportunity that all cities have is just a matter of providing with the resources that a city like Los Angeles or a city like New York has\nTwo cities like Kampala Uganda or to Mogadishu Somalia and so just the needs looking forward or or or dramatic and the current policies and and discourse at an international level is not recognizing that reality\nLinda give us a sense of what are the essential components that help refugees adjust in LA\nOne of the areas that we've been very focused on is\nHow do we for example in rural children who are immigrants or you know are refugees or asylum seekers here in our city and we have some great partnerships that we've developed with ah our local school district\nWe have a specific center that's a designated\nFor unaccompanied minors for example who have come to the city and to also help their parents not only for enrollment but also with mental health services\nAnd other wraparound services that I think had been very important in their integration\nInland it we also know that the office of refugee resettlement except that it expects that half of all the families separated by the U.S administration zero tolerance immigration policy will actually be detained in greater LA is the city prepared for that influx of folks\nWere very prepared we in fact coordinated a strategy with the county one of the things that we've done immediately because cities are first responders in many cases when we have you know populations that arrived\nIs to also provide legal representation and working with a local legal organizations that are representing some of the families that had been reunified and we've also created\nUnder mayor or city and the county the LA justice fund which has a fund that provides legal assistance to immigrants asylum seekers a refugee populations domestic violence survivors\nWho are eligible for you know TVs are ... says so it's a public private partnership and that allows for people to get that legal representation especially those who are facing deportation\nYou know we we establish that this is not just a domestic issue this is an international issue and we've seen\nWaves of migration continually not just coming here to the United states\nThroughout Central America throughout the ... you you know I mean this is not something that's going to stop in fact it might even increased given climate change and everything else that we've laid out I'd like to ask you both what do you think are the biggest challenges that cities will face and the next ten years hammer\nIs preparedness I think number one ... you know I mentioned the example of Kampala when I speak with city officials and tell them that your city will be the biggest city in the world\nI'm about Thirty years they simply do not have the resources to deal with that the point is it takes all hands on deck to think\nNot just reactive Lee which is very much how I think the international system has worked but not being surprised when you see this amount of people show up on your doorstep because this is the trend as you mentioned and has been for for decades\nAnd Linda what about you what do you think that the biggest challenges cities will face over the next ten years\nHousing it's also access to education you know we're not going to St declines in the number of people that are arriving to the destination cities like LA or New York or Chicago I think it's imperative that\nLeader take that challenge and really create not only the infrastructure but also think through how other partners can come along in this process of agenda setting for their integration\nLyndon Lopez is the director of the Los Angeles mayor's office of immigrant affairs and ... is the urban advisor
