Shane y'all want we all want to want to get better boy when we got we're\nCalled the Proud Boys so this was a comedian founding a political group is it a political group\n[noise] they have chapters throughout the country you know San Francisco LA this is where all the Proud Boys are Seattle Tennessee Wisconsin Vermont there's also the Proud Boys girls not the Proud Boys girls\nIt's hard to family members there are they have closed Facebook groups for vetting potential members their public Facebook group has around twenty two thousand followers\nWhen they've been covered in the press recently which they have been a tiny bit usually people talk about them as possibly of white nationalist groups maybe white power group that's not exactly what you found\nIn any of the coverage that we did see about the Proud Boys the journalists were you know trying to suss out whether or not the Proud Boys were racist or whether they believe they were racist or not and none of them really brought up their views towards women\nAnd once I started interacting with them on line and watching Gavin McKenna says videos on YouTube I realize that there's this whole online culture of you to personalities conservatives appealing to millennials they watch their Youtube videos all the time and that's where they get a lot of their ideas and\nThey had been having this on line conversation for some time now it's now just set\nNow that Donald Trump is president it entered the public sphere so described for me with the Proud Boys believe and what they stand for [noise]\n[noise] well it's all a club\nA lot of it does come from Gavin McGinnis so I figured I might as well go straight to the source\nIt's just a men's club what is the knights of Columbus about what are the ... lodge about water all mans groups about I Love meeting these guys once a month and going through our rituals and drinking beer and hanging out with them and I love to west fast where we all went to Vegas and shot guns and got drunk\nIt was like being with a bunch of Vikings and it was a blast that's why we do it because there's a real war on masculinity in this country that starts in kindergarten and goes all the way up to adulthood and it's not natural there's no big massive agenda there is no\nSecret tone secret ritual where there's a big plan to start World War three there's no like our views on abortion or race or anything that they're there isn't a list of that there's no criteria there's no political criteria to get in all of that as being injected by the liberal media by fake news\nHe's really defensive right off the bat why is that\nThis American Life story where they reported that one of the organizers of the unite the Right rally in Charlottesville was a proud boy Gavin making his claims that person was never a member of the Proud Boys and that the group disavowed all white nationalism or Nazis\nThe leftist wish\nNazis and everything might be racist everything might be white supremacy\nYou know I'm just asking what the group believes and then you went into what you're not right because\nYou know you're from NPR and I know you're you have a liberal bent here and I'm a journalist what's your background I tend to spend a disproportionate amount of time\nOf hurting the white power allegation [noise] okay well can you tell me what you are about\nYes it's nothing\nIt's just a men's club [noise]\nSo you went to meet some of the local health wise\nI met them at a\nMe at a shopping mall on the outskirts of Milwaukee said yeah I Am at first I met Patrick I'm chatted a little bit [laughter] years friendly than Eric and Brad showed up\nOn one ...\nWe'll see how she behaves went straight to the bar\nWith a here's the fries on my job I had already taught to Eric over face but he's a Wisconsin chapter president Brad and I had had a brief phone conversation before in which he warned me not to even bring up the topic of white nationalism where the interview was over\nHe and organic McGinnis might sue Wisconsin Public radio\nSo when you ask them how they got into the Proud Boys to begin with they all keep referencing Ghassan\nYeah I heard of them are Gavin on YouTube\nA couple of years ago they're very big fans of his I like smart funny people I mean he's got to the\nPart of why I joined Proud Boys besides having somewhere a political views is I Love political banter drinking and uh I haven't run into any proper yet who can't hold their ground in an intellectual debate I found the Proud Boys\nJust by being a fan of shock jock radio growing up you know something I listen to vote\nGrowing up and you know in my time in the navy and the kind of got turned on the gum McInnis\nGavin show was something I was in the daily kind of getting ready for work and stuff\nYou know the emergence of the Proud Boys was kind of at first the ... for that show\nWere they wearing don't they probably have kind of a you\nKnow or yeah they do what they wear a Fred Perry polo shirt it's black with yellow trimming\nThat's their uniform that's what they wear\nTheir big on rituals right I mean we should pause to mentioned this whole thing about the degrees\nYeah so I'm becoming a proud boy is a multi step process the first one is declaring Europe proud boy insane I Am a proud western chauvinists who refuses to apologize for reading the modern world you have to say that out loud\nThe second degree is getting punched by other guys no less than five guys will you try to name five breakfast cereals [laughter]\nSo I mean adrenaline control it that if we're able to get punched with five guys and still managed to squeak of five cereals\nYeah you're you're probably okay\nYou can find there's a bunch of videos as a group of guys in a park they're punching him and you know he's saying ... yeah ... you know and trying to get it out and then afterwards they all hug name you know I'm proud of your boy friday of my\nFamily yeah yeah yeah we have\nAnother part of the second degree is this thing called ... where you give up masturbation\nI'm not a wink or ... why uh I take advantage of right once a month with Devin words of this this is my way of getting guys on the couch right\nAnd they should get out there and use that energy to meet women and start businesses\nThe third degree is getting a proud boy cat too or is it is that the only way to sort of agree I Can't remember any way out of getting a test [laughter] oh no no and the fourth degree is getting in a fight\nOn behalf of the cars\nProud boy will get beat up for wearing a mask I had\nTo make America great again hat or there'll be at a rally and they'll get in a fight with someone and get beat up and you are an honorary degree because you know we feel sorry for you to be that bad 'cause you're idling\nYou know they seem really pissed off and irritated about woke culture and the PC culture that they feel like they have to apologize for being guys all the time and so what the Proud Boys are about is not happy and apologize for being a man's man [noise]\nAnd they want to return to that\n[noise]\nWe politically if you had to nail us on the spectrum I Would say Ninety five percent of his land on the new right they're socially liberal fiscally conservative they don't really care if you're gay or anything like that\nBut they think the tradition as some value in this been you know we've drawn up the baby with the bathwater quite literally and uh you know there's a winner letting their ovaries dry up for some stupid career and blogging [noise] how old are you\nTwenty nine\n... so you you're right there you go to stop dating comedians and musicians and start thinking seriously about your mate\nThat seems like he makes a giant right turn right there he's talking about libertarian politics and suddenly he's asking you whether you're planning on having babies I think that's kind of his and\nYeah it was ever Facebook yeah because this happened before I interviewed cabin about the story might not happen\nBecause most of the members of the Facebook group just [noise]\nYou know nobody wanted to talk nobody wanted\nAnd Eric sent me a little blurb about what they're about\nThat he likes hanging out with other men in western values and [noise]\nYou know asked him if he would be interested in an interview and he said he would think about it [noise]\nI think it was a Sunday Morning I looked at my Facebook messages and he had sent me a message late that friday night saying\nShould I bring the condoms because I Know when you hear the truth you're going to be ready [noise]\nAnd then it showed that it eight am the next morning\nHe said\nOh sorry about that I got a little rowdy last night [noise]\nI was irritated I felt like this guy's wasting my time he thinks this is a joke he's not\nTaking it seriously and I'm\nReading a lot of work for me that is\nActually this is exactly who they claimed to be\nSo why don't I just\nWhat are your members sent me a message on Facebook saying should I bring that condoms to our interview 'cause I Know when you hear the true you're going to be ready that family value\n[laughter] that's funny value [noise] if you're gonna play with the big boys as a journalist you should have a sense of humor you can't be a church lady and simultaneously a feminist\nOh someone made a joke now and the lady who don't offend me [noise] it's like women don't want to be equal to men they want to be treated special\nI just don't see that just seems like it conflicts a lot with what you're saying and your theories about like ... women\nAre you bringing condoms was demeaning sexist thing to say\nYou don't think it is that was a joke\nAnd why do you mentioned earlier with Charlie giants for it\nYeah well he clearly figured out how you're going to frame it the way you're framing it right now do you think you literally wanted to know if you should bring prophylactic\nTo the meeting\nNo so that's a joke\nSo it's all of this a joke\nOr the Proud Boys have joked what is a joke and what's not is there anything that's serious about it\nI think that the left is willfully ignorant of jokes when it suits them there's some meaning behind all this and there's a lot of humor and all of this like most guys stuff and I think for you to pretend that you can't isolate what's a joke and what isn't is disingenuous\nI guess I'm just trying to understand what you're saying\nIn relation to all there's not that you said about this\nI completely you're not trying to understand anything and you're trying to make this story fit your narrative and to do that you have to pretend that you don't get jokes and pretend that I'm inconsistent and pretend that I've been knowing the looming Nazi threat and I think it's evidence that you're doing the wrong job\nSo we're back to your job and get [laughter] what do you make is that um why can't you take a joke defense\nI'd interviewed an analyst for this story from the Southern Poverty Law Center his assessment of the Proud Boys and to be All right and the all light in general\nIs that they use plausible deniability everything's like kind of a joke all the time so like just in case you have any critique of what they believe they can come back and say look at our\nRituals look at the serial beatings and they can say basically that it's all a joke\nBut also this you know this is a pretty common defense you say something offensive and when somebody says wait a minute that's offensive then you say to show clips the matter with you it's kind of a way to cut people's feet out from under them if you know what I mean\nExactly and it's so ironic because they're constantly talking about it's free speech free speech is a free market of ideas why are you trying to restrict it and yet you're threatening me with a lawsuit if I even ask you about white nationalism in an interview\nAnd even asking Kevin Bacon is what the Proud Boys represent elicit says defenses I see what you're doing left wing liberal fake news media and this anger\nCoupled with I don't think you should have this job I think you should stay home and be a mom right\nI Know that some of it is serious you know he seemed to had kids and became a dad and it sounds like once he became a father he really had this come to Jesus moment\nAnd now that's why I think a lot of his discussion around men and women in their late twenties early thirties is about you know you really need to settle down because like this is what life is really about\n\n\n[noise] the other thing that comes across pretty loud and clear is how embattled they feel it's like they really feel sort of under siege that they're\nOut of step with mainstream community ... and they sounded like they feel like they take risks saying what they really believe in public\nYeah and I think that there's some legitimacy to that you know Patrick tells the story is\nGoing to his neighbor's house I was wearing a make America great again hats are all hanging out drinking beers in the backyard neighbor wouldn't let him use the bathroom in our house\nAnd I laugh thinking they were joking and they were dead serious they now look at it as like a personal front if you have a different political view I'm kind of appalled by 'cause I'm I'm so free speech more than anything they say that\nThey're targeted for their political\nBeliefs Eric has been docks where they post your address phone number your employer on line\nThey never would tell you their last names right\nI Know their last names um but yeah they didn't want to go on the record with their last names\nThe first name basis that's exactly why because\nTo you know allow somebody to be\nA job that they work very hard to\nSomething that I don't want our side of things I don't want their side to face I don't ever want any of our people going after people jobs that's all never lose my job because of this but\nCome across to me just listening to this conversation as thoughtful caring really rational\nYeah like they felt OK about the whole evening\nThey were pretty drunk so we're going to drink and\nI'm I'm happy I I think that we represented our side candidly and honestly so runway every time I make sure like you\nVery good looking intelligent\nOr [noise]\n\n[laughter]\nAnd actually I didn't know that the condoms common and I didn't\nBring it up during our interview 'cause I didn't know how Eric would react so Brad said you know\nWow what an awful oh really\nYeah he did and I was like wow I'm really surprised to hear you say that free speech right and he was like yeah that tact am I right\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] ... ... ...\n...

of eighty one\nA teenager from what they might last six asylum in the United states but under the Trump Administration his chances are extraordinarily slim and he goes to court by himself he's given a list of lawyers that he could call free lawyers they are too busy to take him he's connected with a private lawyer who is willing to help them\nBut he has to pay forty five hundred dollars that time ... and this is the takeaway\nAlso on the show the problems with using artificial intelligence in hiring\nAlgorithms and often\nExacerbate perpetuated by as they can exacerbate the discrimination problem\nAnd the fight to give more representation to the group that is often considered the backbone of the Democratic party the last thing the Democratic party can afford is for black women to stay home on any election day any place in this country\nAll that and your takes as well on the take away after the headlines [noise]\nCommitting violence on these teens who are trying to be recruited into gangs so he said those are private criminal actors\nAnd it makes it much tougher his orders to the immigration judges where it's very tough right now to grant asylum in the past however the judges would have some discretion they could say well you know I think in this particular case I'm going to side with the kids lawyer and what's happening now is\nThere is no guaranteed right to a lawyer in immigration court for anybody but\nIt's especially difficult for children because their children they don't know the law they don't have an adult coming with them and so there's been an effort over the years to provide lawyers for the children but in the past year it's the number of kids who are represented goes down if you don't have a lawyer you're virtually never going to get your case heard\nLast year fiscal year twenty Seventeen only about forty percent of the kids got lawyers and what's happened is the lawyers are saying that they are so busy now with Trump's immigration policies their cases are taking longer it's harder to get new clients\nAnd ... you know there's also a weird quirk in the New York city immigration court where they used to have a room for the lawyers to meet with the kids on certain days when the kids would come to court and there'd be three judges aside\nTo hear their cases and now that room was taken away because they needed to turn it into another courtroom so the kids come to court and this is how I met Melvin\nTo come to court by themselves there's nobody to meet them and say here here's how to get a lawyer there's just some lawyers passing out flyers in the hallway and melting as by himself completely afraid thinking he's going to get deported that day when that's not actually what's going to happen who's just appearing and the judge was asking do you have a lawyer\nHe didn't have a lawyer he was told okay you have three more months comeback\nHopefully you'll have a lawyer then and he leaves terrified thinking what am I going to do I have to find a lawyer\nSo if a minor does not have say a sponsor or a family that's waiting to take them and they can't find a lawyer what happens\nIt's very difficult Melvin was lucky because he came in the beginning of the year he was released to an uncle who lives in Bush wick but\nIf he had come later this year the Trump Administration made it harder\nFor the sponsor the relative to take the child by adding of stricter background check with fingerprinting that would also inform immigration of that sponsors status so Melvin uncle is undocumented\nA lot of the kids who are coming now are staying longer and longer and the shelters where their place when they first cross the border like males and he only stayed for about a month in Arizona than he was placed with its uncle but these days the kids are saying several months the shelters are\nBack logged now with kids and that's why they're moving some of the kids to a tent city in in Texas where they don't have the same rights to an education every day that they would in a normal sheltered that's contracted with the federal government has to meet certain standards\nThey can stay in this tent city and kind of harsh conditions\nThere trying to pick I've heard the kids who are ready to be placed with sponsors very soon so they're not little ones who are going to be hanging out for a long time but it's still a difficult situation and it's because of the bottleneck right now that the background checks have made it harder to place the children\nGiven that bottleneck and given these delays um are there concerns about what could happen to these kids when they're in this limbo are they more susceptible to running away are they more susceptible to a mental health issues because there is a sort of a hot in this limbo like what happens when this is now\nExtended this time period where they're staying in this limbo was extended to these kids\nWill first these kids are in trauma if they are fleeing violence and even if they're not it it's pretty dramatic journey to come to the U. S. and Melvin case he wrote the beast\nWhich is it's a series of cargo trains that kids and other migrants jump on top of and ride for days it's very very dangerous and he was actually robbed at the end of it before he got to the border um some bandits took money from him but\nIt's a tough experience getting to the u._s. then you're staying in this kind of limbo for a while without somebody who loves you it's an agonizing weight\nAnd the longer you drag it out\nChild experts and trauma and in child psychology say it it just makes it much much more difficult for these kids to become more resilient when they come out they don't feel the love and support if somebody they've been living in limbo they don't know their future these are young minds that are still developing some of the kids or many of these kids remember are younger than teenagers\nSo it's not a situation that you want to prolong on the other hand the government says we are doing these background checks because sometimes the kids get placed with traffickers that has happened there have been cases where the government doesn't really do a good job of checking who the kids went to in the past\nAnd they wound up going to people who could take advantage of them and exploit them so you do want to make sure that they're going to someplace safe\nBut to delay it this long as what immigration advocates the thing is very dangerous for the children and can you give us an update on where he is now [noise] yeah um first of all he's very typical so he's in in some ways and I don't want to be clear about this he is\nHe's just like thousands of other kids okay but but he's not he's his own person with his own story of being threatened of being cut on the arm by people who tried to recruit him to joined a gang to sell drugs and to kill people\nAnd that was very very scary for him and his family said do you have to leave because they pray on teenage boys\nAnd if he had known more about the process for example he could've photographed his wounds when he was in Guatemala he could have gone to a doctor although he said there was no hospital in his town he could have\nMaybe gotten some affidavits or something for people to say what had happened but he just came he didn't know what to do\nAnd so now his story I suspect it's just a story\nHe's still has the scars he's going to have to now that he has a lawyer he's going to meet with a trauma expert clinical social worker to kind of piece together who story because it's a little bit fragmented you know it's it's hard he's very reserved and it's tough it's going to be a few years probably before his case goes to court and ironically\nBecause the courts are so back logged\nIt could hurt Melvin case that it's taking so long but it could also help them if there's another president at the end of this with different immigration policies so we don't know what's going to happen but in the meantime\nHe's working at a pizzeria to pay for his lawyer is not supposed to work until he gets working papers which you do after you fall for asylum\nBut he has to pay for his friend he has to pay for his lawyer and this could work six days a week and he's a very industrious kid he'd like to learn English she doesn't have the time to take classes he could conceivably enroll in high school but he doesn't have the time because he wants to pay and he wants to do the right thing and and go to court\nBeth Fertig is a senior reporter at WNYC best thanks so much for helping us with this story thank you for having me\n[noise]\nYesterday on the show we talked about

can do to be better global citizens lots of you called us with your advice and reactions\nOn law and I'm calling from Orlando we keep talking about it it would doing something and we're not doing one quarter of what we should be doing even\nThink they make fake mandatory it make it mandatory everywhere it's greed\nAnd want and overuse of finite resources that have created an incredibly big part of the problem\nIs this is er in Philadelphia and I voted green the last two big questions regarding my insurance I Can't believe it isn't a bigger issue\nOn world stage this is calling from San Diego California the easiest thing that we could all do today is simply to eat less meat and dairy\nShot from Washington state and as much as I can change the channel [laughter] small carbon footprint as I can I also got it's totally\nI sure hope it's not too late and I appreciate you and everyone else who weighed in you can share your thoughts plus tell us what steps and you take in your own life to

become a leading voice and the lightning rod in the black lives matter movement you know he's selling his own story next on on one\nWeek after first coast to the fund eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. your community your world\nData doesn't really have much regulation on that's where we have to start\nAnd so what that means is that recruiters can really try to pull data from whatever sources are publicly available and privately available now there are certain laws they have to respect\nCivil rights laws for example but for the most part they can try to get data from anywhere in this could be some social media could be from the broader Internet it\nCould be from data brokers it could be from former employers they are all sorts of sources and when they're able to get more and more information about a particular candidate and drives the development of inferences about that candidates behaviors and interests through analysis of bad data using AI\nThey can really save some costs in the in the recruitment process\nDevelop recommendations for candidates that can really do the specialized job in the most effective manner\nAnd let's talk about\nThe bias that could show up initially and we've seen the research on this um for decades now that people who have quote unquote black sounding names or ethnic sounding names for example depending on what they are may not get hired and people who don't are more likely to get the interview\nHow does that play out in hiring what's the positive here for using an algorithm if I'm a hiring manager and what's the drawback\n[noise] yeah well times you know I think there is a lot of economic value in this kind of technology because it can cut\nTime costs the problem is that algorithms and especially artificial intelligence algorithms can often exacerbates and perpetuate biases because when you are basing your inferences about uh about a set of resumes\nBased on historical data you can absolutely be furthering the idea that certain candidates are just not good for this company\nSo for example if we are looking at a big bulge bracket bank perhaps historically their highest performing candidates have looked a particular way beyond a certain race spin a certain gender had a certain level of educational attainment from a certain small set of universities and\nIf they train their algorithm based on that historical information than the algorithm is going to think that hey it's those candidates that I have to look for and must cut out the rest\nAnd so what that means is that we can have huge discriminatory effect against everybody else that deserves for their resume to be looked at but who don't fit this historical profile and who are essentially being discriminated against and that is actually illegal\nAnd the problem is that these algorithms are proprietary private and it's hard for us to have that transparent [noise]\nWe'll have more with the pie and goes on how artificial intelligence in hiring and how it intersects of privacy concerns in just a moment it without\nHow we think about things and how would you like\nAnd I I guess we should talk\n\n\nAnd we're back with the pie and goes from the Harvard Kennedy School he was also a technology and economic advisor in the Obama White house had more recently worked on privacy policy issues that Facebook\nWe're talking about privacy in the age of artificial intelligence ay ay is something that touches more parts of our lives and never before including how we get hired for jobs I asked him how private proprietary hiring algorithms reconcile with a person's privacy\nUp until now and it just doesn't records and that's that's the problem that we have\nA lot of people don't necessarily want their information to be grabbed by recruiters whether it's a vendor or big company trying to look into you and and determine whether or not you're a good candidate\nFor a job at a bank or a job at Google or a job at any sort of multinational company a lot of people just don't want their information to be pulled by these organizations and for their behavior and characteristics and personalities and routines and likes and dislikes and interests and\nPreferences many of us don't want that to be on the show for recruiters how do we matched that there's not really a good solution for that in the United states we do not have a baseline privacy law\nEurope does have a fundamental right to privacy Europeans do and many other countries and jurisdictions around the world they're not trying to develop something similar in the United states we don't and it it's actually\nA bit of a non starter here to give the individual whether it's a voter or consumer or any potential candidates for a job it's a tough political battle to sell policymakers and politicians on the idea that privacy is something that deserves respect\nI I Know it because I covered that many years ago particularly um when there were many efforts in Washington DC to try to pass some sort of policy legislation and that was under the Obama administration actually has your work at the Obama White house right Facebook influenced how you look at this today\n[laughter] absolutely while I was in the Obama White house the Snowden disclosures and just happened there was a lot of attention on the administration there was a lot of pressure on America to do something about privacy\nOr in other words do something about the breach of trust against Silicon Valley really and the American government in light of\nThe tremendously challenging and extensive surveillance programs that America and the national Security Agency were were engaging\nAnd part of our job was to craft a baseline privacy law which we ultimately called the consumer privacy bill of rights and ultimately the president announced that as a legislative draft as a discussion draft for the consideration of the U.S Congress\nAnd released it publicly in early twenties Fifteen we released it on late on a friday night because we knew that it was going to be dead on arrival and fall on deaf ears and was it was a nonstarter for about a political level\nSo let's talk about where we go from here I feel like this technology has because of a lack of privacy\nIt just shouldn't um because I'm of how fast this technology has a moved it almost seems like it's unstoppable\nYeah absolutely and and we do need policy change in this country let's just talk very briefly about where things are going to go if nothing is done which is\nWhat many people anticipate if nothing is done the industry is going to continue to develop artificial intelligence applied to recruiting and will not have any public interest auditing that that happened\nAnd so the discrimination problem is not necessarily going to be perpetuated but very likely will be perpetuated because the public will have no leverage to understand how companies are using these algorithms and making their hiring decisions\nThat's what's gonna happen how do we move away from a world where we have is OK city in recruiting well the public needs to understand that\nOur data is an extension of ourselves and it is extraordinarily valuable to corporate interests it's extraordinarily valuable to foreign actors it's extraordinarily valuable to almost any entity that might want to know anything about him\nAnd until and unless the American public understands that and I understand the value of data and the value of privacy\nAnd pushes our politicians for change policy change in this area that can really be meaningful and move Congress nothing's gonna happen\nDefy and go to the fellow at the shore and steam center at the Harvard Kennedy School the pie and thanks for joining us [noise] thank you so much
