{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Some of these columns have just been collected in a book called if you ask me and our book critic Marine Corps again has a review\nAn advice columnist Eleanor Roosevelt was not especially witty nor psychologically acute unlike many of today's inspirational life coaches Eleanor didn't invite her readers to accompany her on extended journeys of introspection\nIndeed when a questionnaire wrote to her in Nineteen forty four asking what does the president said to you when he proposed Eleanor firmly drew the curtains over that intimate subject by replying there are some things in life which one should be allowed to keep to one's self\nBut one of the things Eleanor did have going for her as a counselor and dispenser of practical wisdom was the fact that she was so real\nShe clearly was not performing nor winking at her readers and she certainly wasn't checking in with the PR team before weighing in on questions ranging from the death penalty anti\nBirth control pro and how soon a widow might begin dating again after the loss of a beloved husband\nHeavens above Eleanor explained in a column in Nineteen forty six you can decently be seen with other men whenever you feel like going out again this is your life\nOnce upon a time in America ordinary people turn to Eleanor Roosevelt for advice\nAnd does these columns that test she read paid their trust with responses that are downright startling to read today because of how seriously she took even their most mundane problems\nEleanor is advice column was called if you ask me and it ran first in the ladies' home journal and then ... calls magazine from Nineteen forty one when of course she was still first lady to her death in Nineteen sixty two\nA selection of those columns has just been published in a book also called if you ask me edited by Eleanor Roosevelt scholar Mary Jo banker\nAs with anything Eleanor\nYou have to wonder where she found the time to be a regular magazine columnist in addition to among other things raiding her syndicated newspaper column called my day\nHolding weekly White House press conferences traveling around the country on behalf of new deal programs and answering some estimated one hundred and thirty thousand letters a year as first lady\nThe America that emerges through this Twenty years sampling of Eleanor is advice column is it once familiar and very long gone\nWe're still wrestling of course with arguments over civil liberties national health care the electoral college and institutionalized racism and sexism\nEleanor gamely weighed in on those hot button topics but then there are a whole slew of other letters here that come out of an America so earnest it almost seems like the product of a work of speculative fiction\nImagine being a young woman in Nineteen forty nine and feeling that it was okay to write to Eleanor Roosevelt to asked two girls who refused to neck ever get married\nOr the Nineteen year old boy in Nineteen forty six who's already a veteran of World War two who asks Eleanor if he's too young to marry his sweetheart\nEleanor uncharacteristically waffle on that one\nAlthough she was by nature and upbringing emotionally reticent Eleanor some times responded to the genuine need of her questioners within openness that was rare than and almost unimaginable now\nIn Nineteen fifty four Eleanor received this letter that reads my sister eats her heart out about mistake she made bringing up her oldest boy\nShe thinks she weren't great woman Mrs Roosevelt and I\nShe could tell her a few mistakes you think you made when your children were growing up\nEleanor wrote along response that in part contain these raw admissions I gave in and allowed one of my sons to be sent to boarding school I did not have the courage to fight the family tradition it was a serious mistake on my part\nI did too little for my three older children personally when they were babies\nAs trivial a cultural artifact as an advice column may seem to be Eleanor is if you ask me columns reveal multitudes about the extraordinary relationship she forged with her fellow Americans of all races young and old\nThere's something very democratic about this twenty plus year monthly conversation of sorts that Eleanor conducted on the pages of popular women's magazines people felt they had a right to contact Eleanor and she felt she had a responsibility to respond\nAnd although seriousness was her hallmark as an advice columnist I also get the feeling that writing these columns and consequently being more connected to the lives of everyday Americans gave Eleanor great joy\nMarine Corps again teaches literature at Georgetown University she reviewed if you ask me essential advice from Eleanor Roosevelt edited by Mary Jo Baker\nTomorrow in fresh air will examine facts that dispel the myth of Donald Trump as a self made man my guess will be New York times reporter since then ... and\nDavid Barstow who's investigative reporting based on a trove of documents reveals how Trump received the equivalent today a four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's real

R.\nShannon Henry fiber has been doing some digging [noise] I read that you have a poisonous plant gardening [noise] you can't just walk into a garden and I say I would like twelve man drinks first pick your poison\nLike that you want to get away with\nSomeone you don't want anyone and then clean ... case somewhat that don't have an extradition training\nAshtray and Shapes Our lives our a crash course in vicious vegetation and\nIt sounds like people sitting down to a dinner party\nIt's like butter roll a little more at your\nThis experiment that was the nickname the poison squad by the local newspapers in which he got young male government employees\nClerks who had very little money and we're happy to get free meals and that was the sort of deal with the devil will give you three free meals a day beautifully cooked by our master chef and only using great ingredients but\nHalf of you for giving periods of time are gonna have to also take capsules of the suspect compound of that particular test so you'll be having bar acts with every meal or you'll be having formaldehyde with every meal\nWith poison dinner party [laughter] group of young men to see how they're going to get it is really\nLike that you know it's interesting 'cause one of the things the Washington Post and the Washington Post just law the story and they saw endless opportunities for entertaining their readers whether\nThey actually created like a fake holiday menu it's like turkey a little ...\nButter roll a little more acts but basically what happened was they created a kitchen and a dining room in the basement of the agriculture department but white table cloth and let her back shares of the deal was that they had to eat\nBreakfast lunch and dinner in this dining room and they were not allowed to eat anything anywhere else no\nGo out for a beer with friends know sneak a snack\nI'm not sure you would be able to persuade anyone today to do\nRight [laughter] [noise] so how did they get\nSome of them got really sick and it really depended on the compound with formaldehyde people were really throwing up so sex so fast that they just cancelled the tests\nWith bore acts it was more gradual they took very low doses and then they would ... the dos and what they found was\nAt very low doses you know some of them were a little whiny but no one was really set\nBy the time he started hitting a medium does people at stomach upset said gee I a sense they had headaches sad bloating eating this cleanser on a daily basis was not working\nFor them so he came up with all these results I mean this really kind of remarkable science experiment to testing all these different foods how did the food industry respond\nThe food industry it was really unhappy really unhappy the Pacific bore acts company you this'll be a a term we use today fake news\nThey had their publicist assume a fake name and plant fake stories in newspapers across the country criticizing Wiley a and pretending that people were dying of food poisoning because ... was not around I mean you know it was really crazy\nWow there's some other sort of fascinating characters in the story that you tell one\nIs the writer Upton Sinclair who's Nineteen oh six novel the jungle was all about the appalling conditions in the stockyards of Chicago and and he wanted to expose sort of how horrible the working conditions were in the slaughterhouses but\nIt sort of had other unintended effect and the\nPeople were sort of already starting to summer and then you get these really crazy descriptions of food processing in the jungle in which\nThey're poisoning rats and then they just chop up the rap bodies of throw it into the meat and meat is rotting and molding and they scrape that often throw a little formaldehyde or a bar accent and blood is dripping everywhere there was just a firestorm of response\n[laughter] if you haven't made our listeners queasy up to tell you I can do better [laughter] when this book came out of course the Packers like this is fiction this is fiction\nAnd a Doubleday page had sent to a copy of it to Roosevelt Teddy Roosevelt who is the president and of course he was this can't be right so he said the vets to get her team everyone is like this can't be right\nAnd they found that it was worse also and there's these horrible descriptions and their report of cows falling into the workers latrines and then just being dragged across the floor and you know chopped up after that and going off into whatever\nRoosevelt when he got this report used it to blackmail Congress the first made inspection act passed in June of Nineteen oh six\nAnd with that ... long fought for food and drug law\nWas passed right after that so the one who led to the momentum that finally pushed the other rover\nSo this sort of seems like ancient history now all of this to happen to a hundred years ago or so we have a whole regulatory system in place to monitor food safety most of our foods are labeled how safe is our food now\nIt's a lot safer than it was in the nineteenth century\nThere are labels and the government does consider this part of its business we've laid down a foundation which consumer protection\nIs part of the job of government which was not true in the nineteenth century so that's a huge deal so our food is safe or not as safe as it should be for all the reasons and this to me was what made this story so applicable today\nIt's not as safe as it should be for all the reasons that it was not as safe as it should be in Nineteen oh six when we started ... out these regulations we compromise a lot with business and so there are tests everything there are actually materials\nThat have been used in cosmetics that have moved over to food but they've never been safety tested for food because they didn't kill anyone when they were used as\nIn cosmetic formulas right even though we are now eating them\nThat's exactly right one of the messages that if it's on your label it's been safety tested it hasn't necessarily been\nKind of like in some ways we are still living in party while he's world\nI think we are I think we're smarter and better at it\nBut we have not grown up as much as I think he would have hoped we have done\nWas the dissatisfied food regulator that you're probably twenty century it would be dissatisfied today\nDeborah Blum directs the Knight Science journalism program at MIT and she's the author of the new book the poison sliding\nFee pulse and talked with her\nAnd if you haven't asked we are talking about poison this hour\nWhich can turn up in a lot of unexpected places\nSo I was visiting a scientist who works on developing new varieties of lilies\nHe's a lily expert [noise]\n\nAs we were getting ready to leave he said hang on a minute I Want to show you something else I have growing in the corner over here men don't tell anyone about this I don't want my boss to know that I have one in the [noise]\nThat he had was circulating among students on campus [noise]\nAnd so students were telling him\nWe're growing areas rock slum coca which is the plastic cocaine comes from the south American shrug it would be very hard to grow\nThe traditional Bolivian way to consume coca leaves is to chew on it [noise]\nBut it's not as immediate suspicious and said I don't think that's what you have I don't see that growing in a dorm room\nAnd I'm worried about what you kids are doing that\nBut it took them a long time to get anyone to trust him enough\nTo bring him a specimen at the plant\nAnd sure enough it was not air ... coca\nAnd I don't remember the name of the plant but it was quite deadly it was quite toxic\nAnd if you cheat on enough of those leaves your throat with close up and\nYou wouldn't be able to breathe and you'd have to go to the hospital\nSo that's what he had and that's what got me thinking about\nEasily it is for people to be misled or food [noise]\nI go on a walk through a gardener on a hike with someone and they'll be like a very often Bush and go here try this and I'm always like\nTo pick your poison [noise]\nWe'll be right back to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio [noise] and ... are back [noise]\n[noise]\nMy ... milk street radio this week I chat with running one day about Appalachia including pickle baloney in Chile bonds from sixty poor also in this

T. dot\nIt's a pretty gruesome way to die isn't\nIt terrific I the TV on film they don't want to do it because she wants TV poisoning\nPeople take a whole ... and that that almost role in second and I know how it happened in the fall majority K poisoning takes depending on the points in most cases poisoning takes hours\nAnd it is an agonizing she out to be very upsetting can sun\nWhich brings me to actually one of the things that always makes me a little uneasy reading especially Christie's novels she usually uses poisons that\nPeople can get hold of sometimes that they can just grew up themselves say from plants growing in the garden mhm I always used to read them if they can you think you should be letting people know this has anybody ever actually copied her murders and the real world\nThere are huge example when I have happened that was a case in wrong wet and then three by now he took a strong dislikes that a woman who is a great friend of his uncle\nAnd so he had to she came to his point to get rid of [laughter] he added a pain to a bottle of wine and gave the wind to his uncle is a gift known that his uncle very rarely if ever drank wine so his uncle at least I thought\nThat should occasion when the train comes around all over the line and ...\nUnfortunately the uncle said the ... whole Christmas Day oh no he and his wife drank kit and ... they hate on\nNo vehicle was quite old people put it down to natural causes but when they went around to the uncles how to kind of Clara compare things for the hearing all\nGo to the wire on the table\nAnd you know for all I like blood wine so they toasted the uncle and these people got sick because while this was the best of luck but it was something sinister going long because I went round guy last night that it's ... and they found an Agatha Christie book\nAnd the book just happened to pool I turn the page without tripping poisoning in it [noise] and he was convicted\nOh my gosh slippers murder through literary influence\nAnd I were quaint town to anyone who's thinking if you think they asked that question the metro weighs ... pounds out so you know she is very good guys\nThe ones that scared me most were the ones that anybody could concoct with ordinary household ingredients wasn't there one poisoning with nicotine and the murder and made it by smoking cigarettes and water I had no idea you could do that\n... ... people used to use nicotine they should make that kind of cigarette ... grew and use it and thought on that raises [noise] and ah the bomb them in that case the man who kept his nicotine grew in an old friend also\nYou can see what I was going so he goes to ... to have a cross the ... a brand have dinner and of course he picks up the mobile home\nAnd he knew instantly he drunk so bustle and he ran back to his house he opened up the fridge and he tried to drink milk to counteract the effects\nDid it work no he was dead before he could raise the health trends that\nWow in some of those classic murder mysteries I remember detectives referring to poison as a woman's weapon\nAnd with some contempt like if you're a man you're going to stand up straight and bludgeon somebody's death but a woman will sneak are heading into your dessert while smiling in your face\nIt completely rubbish and um the what something along the line all they're all ten times as many nail nudge artists that are all female\nMeasures [noise] yes winning use poison more for the men but intends to show the numbers that all mole nail question is a female ...\nAnd women still use other methods more often than they use poison ... to ... it it doesn't me the question is a woman as a weapon Kristy um which you mentioned she was Robert ... about the whole thing I had a fifty fifty\n[laughter] equal opportunity poison [laughter] see I think that\nThere's more in that stereotype the fact that we associate poisoning with the kind of sneaking this and that we also feel contempt for it in some way yes if you think on a a larger societal scale at least in the west it seems like\nPoisoning your political opponents is a no go that's considered unethical but why\nThat does seem to be an extra special category of poisonous above the formal letter\nFrom a very basic pointed to poison someone you have to think about it you have to ... you have to administer\nAnd I thought that it takes a long time for people to die not is a lot of ... shanty time he ... click on what you're doing\nTo change your mind so I think this is an issue in that goal\nIs an extra special kind of\n... that we associate with coins name as one of the kind of making no fat play when you make something and someone's ... pay\nShe brandish a knife in front of them they haven't changed he said the ... so I think maybe it comes down to ... play as well ...\n... history poison it had been singled out but especially cool punishment above the on average much era huh so you know the reason\nIs tight for the coins now it's been around for a long time\nI remember reading that Alexander Litvinenko the dissident Russian spy who was killed was radioactive T pulling him to ten he told the New York times like two years before he was assassinated\nBut in the Russian foreign service poison was seen as just another weapon like a gun what's the difference between bullets and poison\nYou're right there is that to her and ask them what a guy regardless so maybe a I Choose the poisoning is somehow equal mole hole than taking another person's life maybe we're the ones that are in the wrong and we should say poisoning [noise] uh\nJust I don't know what does it seemed like\nPoisons are evolving are being developed I've noticed that the news string of political assassinations it's all with nerve agents or radioactive elements whatever happened to old fashioned cyanide\nI don't like that so much changed\nAny quite that they can and can't be chock a\nPlant you can't touch it and said Hi tiny amount ... that can kill someone if they\nLikewise man the points I Can't I mean he liked his jaw skin ... till so intent on taint next ... and\nI was assuming that the Russians are using poison to kill and these dramatic poisons to deliver a message you can't escape us no matter where you go you will find you and not only find you will get physically really close to you will be watching you will know the patterns of your behavior\nMhm you don't know what the question what she went on and I thought do handle or painting or whatever and they create kind of thing that they can they do very\nWell\nKathryn ... is a chemist and writer and author of a is for arsenic\nTractor down in Valencia, Spain where she is currently investigating another classic literary

is a little ways out of town on top of the hill there is a guy on a riding mower keeping things need\nAnd some simple unremarkable gravestone [noise]\nYes but a lot of time here\nAs a child we what time we would bring and flowers and um remember coming here with my mother and my aunts my sister and I would run around\nAnd what was it you were telling me about underneath system she's married and all that\nLine cough yes yes when they ... they took her to Argonne National lab and when they brought her back she was is in a ... and although one of my aunts she always thought that they never return the body\nSo there may be a lot of radioactive bodies here in the summers are there\nAre there was a gentleman his name was ... he had to have a Geiger counter and he would walk around the cemetery and he could tell where each of the dial painters were buried because the Geiger counter would go off [noise]\nAnd it's a piece of hair and it's so pretty in\n\nOttawa, Illinois is a pretty town of\nEighteen thousand [noise] it's got to leave the main square\nSide of the first Lincoln Douglas debates [noise]\nMost of the radio dial painters lived their whole lives within these few square blocks [noise] they went to school in church here\nIranian dial factory shut down in Nineteen thirty six\nBut the building itself contaminated and radio active [noise] stood here for decades [noise]\nWell see I Lived\nDown the alley from the radium dials up\nAnd down in the basement where they had stored the radium they actually put a meat locker down there\nMany people bought me from the meat locker\nI can go around the neighborhood to families that lived in each and every house and at least one of my friends' parents have not both of them died of cancer they did tear down the original radium dial in Nineteen sixty nine I was in high school and I would come home from school\nAnd the dust from the building would have seeped into my parents' home\nIt would be on the window sills we would have to vacuum we would have to wipe everything down\nThen after that one both of my parents die of cancer and I see other people in the neighborhood and they are dying of cancer it really makes me wonder\nHow could it net and guess what\nThey did with the radioactive rubble they used it as bill they dumped it all over town\nWhere they just took\nAll the remains of the building which would have had a lot of radio yeah\nProbably elements of that building\nNot only buried over town but people might still have souvenirs\nHere's another thing I find unbelievable\nWhile the radium girls were dying\nThe factory owner host of ...\nMoved three blocks away and opened up again\nBut under a different name luminous processes\nThese the slightly different painting technique but the radium was everywhere\nOn workers clothes shoes fingers\nThey got cancer at twice the national rate\nStayed open until Nineteen Seventy eight\nWhen the EPA moved and there were radioactive hot spots all over town in Ottawa, Illinois became a Superfund\n[noise]\nYou know when I was a kid we lived up on the north side and where some of the areas that they\nJumped the waste when your neighborhood friends' houses are getting dug around with guys in spacesuits basically is what you thought when you were a kid um you know they're digging up the whole neighborhood but they're saying oh it's fine you could just build up there in the house while your whole yard and everything is going away\nAnd it's a lot of kids through the years because of playing and all that they all had ill effects from it to\nHow many people in town do you think you know this whole history\nA lot of people don't ... yeah there are a lot of local people a lot of people that I've talked to in Iowa and I got a lot of comments from people they did not know the story they have lived here their entire lives you know people don't talk about\nA few signs that may be changing though\nA new brewery opened up

state but of course when they went to war that was very little evidence of Iranian involvement in Yemen\nWant to turn back to what's happening in within Saudi Arabia and there have been reports as we mentioned in the opening of an increase in women and other activists who've been arrested and detain can you tell us a little bit about some of those examples [noise] sure\nSo if you understand what crown prince has done from the perspective of an absolute and total concentration of power and that any changes that are coming in the kingdom are coming by his decision and his decision only by absolute field\nIt was important for him to jail women activists who had for years campaign for example for the right to drive\nIn order to send a very clear message to Saudi society\nThat they not get any ideas on that his decision to allow women to drive was his decision only a and not a result of civil society activism and campaigning so it was really a very clear message\nTo all of Saudi society not to get ideas that because he was making this reform he was open to being swayed by civil society\nI'm speaking with fairly within the executive director\nSure of the middle east and North Africa division with human rights watch\nSarah I Wonder also let our listeners know that it's not just we talked about Yemen we talked about inside Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia also has had some pretty high profile conflicts if you will with other western countries that have taken issue with its human rights abuses and I'm thinking about Canada for example can you give us a little bit more on that\nIn response to the Canadian foreign ministers I think merely tweeting about the uh continued detention of a blogger in Saudi Arabia named brave but do we owe who was sentenced to ten years in prison and a thousands of washes um which they've since ceased\nAre implementing because it was just too embarrassing and when you never will camera would capture him being lash by Saudi officials because he is married to a Canadian resident someone who sought citizenship now in Canada the Canadian government has spoken on race ... half\nThe response to that or from the Saudi Government from the crown\nPrince really reflects his rather impetuous impulsive angry impulses um was to try to punish a Canada or by withdrawing thousands of Saudi students studying there\nA Saudi citizens seeking medical care there uh and threatening to cut off a business ties with Canada a as well as recalling at some ... or you\nKnow I think of course part of it is to send a message to other states of the punishments that Saudi Arabia will exercise should they criticize the country's record should they criticize the country's violations\nAnd so what we've consistently seen a from the crown prince is impulsive impetuous acting out a like a five year old toddler who doesn't get his way\n... you know one of the things that we talked about yesterday on the show was our economic relationship with the Saudis and I'm Wondering given all the history and there are many more examples that we haven't gotten to yet but why is it that the United states remains so closely allied with Saudi Arabia I mean is there anything\nOr even when we're seeing the response to cause she'll gives disappearance right it's sort of hedging to see what ends up happening what it cannot anything actually be done to push back on these human rights abuses given this very close economic relationship\nWell absolutely and I think it's very important across the board to separate American a business relationships transactional relationships\nFrom our diplomatic a social relationships with abusive\nA government's first of all the u._s. should not itself or be implicated in abuses which it currently is with respect to the war in Yemen not only because of its a supply of weapons\nTo Saudi Arabia or American bombs are have been documented by human rights watch and other organizations to be used\nAnd the president has suggested that he probably will not implement any arms sanctions are arms deals so the arms sales could look like they'll continue\nWell I don't know that they will necessarily continue because Congress has a say and has a voice in this uh and they do have the capacity to condition arms sales\nAre and they have the capacity to raise the cost for what we've seen from the secretary of states waivers of those conditions I'm there does reach a point when it becomes unsustainable to continue with arms sales in the face of atrocities that are receiving widespread international attention um are we close to that point\nWell we've come close to that point repeatedly in Europe Germany suspended arms sales or Spain promise to the Netherlands has suspended arms sales you know they are digging in jogging back and forth but clearly the pressure is there\nUm you know these these are all you know this is not just to sanction Saudi Arabia it's to avoid implicated Americans in war crimes it's to avoid creating the conditions that will naturally create blowback\nFrom Americans and we've seen that over many decades that when the U.S is implicated in terrible abuses in the middle east Americans doesn't become targets of retaliation so it's a national security interest as well\nYou know there's also the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has also been trying to recreate the image of Saudi Arabia given all of these human rights abuses\nA and make it more of seem like it's more of a progressive and modern country what has that looked like so far I'm thinking women being given the right to vote the right to vote the right to drive right is that one example of that\nThat is one example of that um women in Saudi Arabia have now joined the twenty first century um with the abolition of the restriction on their right to drive as well as ah the promise to open movie theaters um which is considered a revolutionary move in twenty Eighteen and Saudi Arabia\nIs a lot of this optics stores that real change no I think it's\nCertainly real you know when when women take the wheel a meat means they have some freedom of movement a and the ban on their driving was one hundred percent about controlling women's freedom of movement\nSo women in Saudi Arabia still can't travel or without the permission of male guardian and Saudi women who have managed to escape Saudi Arabia\nHave found themselves facing a threat to the abduction attempted abductions an actual abduction by Saudi Government officials who literally drag them back\nTo the country and so it is a loosening of that restriction\nAnd I think it's a smart move by MPs to tap into a the majority of its population who are under the age of thirty and who don't understand why their country is so behind the times in these basic things that is extremely embarrassing when people talk about Saudi Arabia the number one example they would always give\nAs well women can't drive there so it's taken that talking point away at what has turned out to be very minimal cost\nFor decades or the Saudi government's defense for continuing to create this ban on women driving was that the public would revolt against the government if they changed it he\nHas called the bluff of all of those threats as to why Saudi can't make changes and so certainly now we want to see other changes like lifting the bans on a women's right to marry women can't get married and Saudi Arabia without their male Guardian's permission\nBarely Woodson is executive director of the middle east and North Africa division with human
