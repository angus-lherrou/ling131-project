{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Which was that small manipulations to the country's voting laws to state voting laws could make a very big difference in close elections and could benefit the Republican Party so we saw the same kind of efforts and the two dozen for election in Ohio and there were massive lines to vote in democratic areas\nAnd then after two thousand eight when there was a record turnout for President Obama and five million new voters cast a ballot think Republicans realized that if they were able to restrict access to the ballot particularly\nFor democratic constituencies like African Americans Latinos Asian Americans the first time voters younger voters\nThey could gain an advantage and they could gain advantage\nBy changing the voting laws and all of these states they control so I think if you look at what we're seeing now\nYou can date it back to what happened during the two thousand election Florida and then fast forward to twenty ten and Republicans took over so many key swing states in order to control the state voting laws all across the country particularly in states that would decide the next president and decide control of Congress\n[noise] another issue I Want to ask you about and I don't know how carefully you've been covering it there's a lot of concern\nAbout um Russia or other foreign countries hacking into our electoral system or interfering with it through a fake a Twitter account spots false information you know um so\nI think twice Republicans this past summer have blocked efforts to increase funding to uh protect our election security against hackers like the rations um what can you tell us about that\nThe Trump Administration and Congress have done almost nothing to make states voting systems more secure and this is clearly ongoing we just saw an indictment last week\nBy the Justice Department that showed that Russians were trying to influence the election through fake Twitter accounts and other things that by the way promoted things like voter ID laws\nAnd raised the specter of widespread voter fraud so they're rushing box where basically echoing what Donald Trump and Kris Kobach and others in the Republican Party were saying about voting issues\nWe know in the twenty sixteen election that Russians accessed voter registration list or try to access voter registration less than Twenty one states\nThey got hold of voter data in Illinois and half a million voters which is very alarming and people focus on the potential of voting machines being half then that is possible particularly in Thirteen states that have no paper backups on their electronic voting machines which include some very important swing states like Pennsylvania in Georgia\nBut they don't even have to have the voting machines themselves\nIf the Russians are others where to get a hold of registration less like they did an Illinois and if they were able to do it undetected and they were able to delete people's names from the voter registration rolls or change\nOne hyphen in the case of someone in Georgia or were able to change someone's last name in states like voter ID laws that in of itself\nWould create huge chaos when those people showed up at the polls and if we could potentially disenfranchised\nThousands of people so it's not just the voting machines are at risk gets the election systems and south particularly the voter registration less\nAnd I haven't seen any aggressive action by the federal government to try to do anything really substantive about this problem so a lot of people are worried about what might happen and twenty Eighteen because the Trump Administration has done so little to try to counteract the threat of Russian hacking\nWhat are you going to be focusing on on election day [noise]\nI think I'm going to have my hands full there are a bunch of new restrictions in place in very close races so places like Georgia and North Dakota and Kansas I'm going to be looking first off on if we have\nAny hard evidence or what the stories are of people potentially being disenfranchised and then looking at did that in impact the outcome of the elections even if it didn't impact the outcome of the elections the fact that ...\nBeing prevented from exercising such a fundamental right is alarming in of itself\nAnd then I'm also going to be looking at all of these ballot initiatives in seven different states that would potentially expand voting rights for millions of people I'm going to be looking at what's happening\nIn local races to have a huge impact on voting rights local secretaries of state races for example were Democrats actually have inability to take back the seats from Republicans and really critical swing states like Ohio and Michigan and Iowa and Georgia and so I'm going to be focused\nOn one hand on the potential threat of voter suppression but on the other hand I'm going to also be focused on the opportunity to expand voting rights for a lot of people so the ... election could go into different ways\nIt could be tainted by voter suppression or it could be remembered as an election in which voting rights were expanded for millions of people [noise]\nLaurie Berman I Want to thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you so much for having me back Terry\nAri Berman is the author of give us the ballot the

I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must what we've done is is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with a you may want to mention went on it yeah\n... we got to the only way you could objectively say that the baby in the mother were engaged in breastfeeding is if the baby's lips were touching the woman's nipple so they included what you could call like an attachment claws but as soon as they got that rule in place [noise]\nLike you would see you know a twenty five year old woman and a teenager looking boy right and like what the hell is going on there\nOh yeah it gets really weird if you like start entering into like child age and it wasn't even going to bring that up because it's kinda gross [laughter]\nIt's like breastfeeding porn is that thing by their sites like ... and so this\nTeam they realize they needed to have a nudity ruled that are allowed for breastfeeding but also had some kind of an age cap so\nSo uh so then we were saying okay once you've progressed past infancy then we believe that it's inappropriate but then [noise]\nPictures would start popping up on the screen and they'd\nBe like wait is that an infant like where's the line between infant and toddler\nAnd so the thing that we landed on was if it looked like the child could walk on his or her own then too old big enough to walk too big breasts\nThat can be among yeah that's like a year old in some cases yeah\nAnd like the world Health Organization recommends breastfeeding until you know like Eighteen months or two years which meant there were a lot of photos still being taken down\nWithin you know days we are continuing to hear reports from people that their photographs were still being targeted but\nThey still do offer a statement you know that's where we're going to draw the line ... policy [noise]\nTo keep in mind through this whole episode is is perhaps the next big thing and the Facebook dot com company was growing really really fast and it\nSeems like almost everyone in on it and in and they're just got to be a lot more content\nWhen we first launch we're hoping for you know maybe four hundred and five hundred people and now we're at a hundred thousand so who knows\nHow isn't more people are joining Facebook every day the million users so far the projection of two hundred\nMillion by the end of the year and now ... Facebook than the entire us popular not\nJust within the United states but also is growing rapidly more international\nYou know you were getting folks in India and turkey\nGetting big throughout the new so they have more and more content coming in from all these different places in all these different languages [noise] how are we going to keep everybody on the same page and so this small team at Facebook got a little bigger and bigger jumped\nUp to sixty people and then a hundred and they set out to create rules and definitions for every huh can we go through some sort of the ridiculous exam leaflets over here today\nSo Gore Gore you mean violence kind of Gore yes so the Gore standard\nWas headlined we don't allow graphic violence and Gore and then the shorthand definition they used was no insides on the outside\nNo good snow blood pouring out of something\nLed was a separate issue there was a an excessive blood rule\nTo come up with rules about bodily fluids seeming for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like what does the clinical setting mean and you know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat\n... at one of my favorite examples is like how do you define art\nBecause as these people are moderating they would see images of naked people\nThat were paintings or sculptures come up and so what they decided to do is say art with naked in this can stay up\nLike it stays up if it is made out of what made out of metal made out of stone really yeah because how else do you define art you have to just be like is this what you can see with your eyeballs\nAnd so from then on as they run into problems those rules just constantly updated constant amendment yeah constant amendments\nNew problem new rule and other new problem updated rule\nIn fact at this point they they're amending these rules up to twenty times a month wow really take for example those rules about breastfeeding in twenty Thirteen they removed\nThe attachment cloth so the baby no longer needed to have its mouth physically touching the nibble at the woman oh and in fact\nA one nipple and or aerial it could be visible in the photo but not to only one then twenty four team they make it so that both nipples or both aerial last may be present in the photo\nWho's is what happens in American War all the time it's very thing yes yeah\nYeah you know it sounds a lot like common law so\nCommon law is the system dating back to early England where individual judges would make ruling which would sort of\nBe a law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judges so the body of law was sort of constantly fleshed out and face that any fact [noise] literally\nEvery time this team that Facebook would would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight ... plop something but I think we're just show up that they that they weren't prepared for that sets a rule had an account\nOr as soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about\nThis for example sometime around twenty eleven this content moderator is is is going through a cue of things\nThat are jak [noise]\n... [noise] it sapped\nAnd she comes upon this image\nThe photo itself was a teenage girl African by dressed in skin breastfeeding goats of baby goats and the moderator throws your hands up and says what gives this and we Googled breastfeeding goats and found that this was this thing it turns out it's a survival practice\nAccording to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that in a drought unknown way to help your herd gets through the drought is to uh if you if you have a woman whose life dating to have her nurse the kid\nThe baby goat along with her human kit and so there's nothing sexual about it's just good for business shouldn't and theoretically if we go point by point through this list it's an infant\nIf it's sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue there but there is there's physical contact between the mouth and the nipple but but obviously\nBreastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants and so in that moment what they decide to do is uh remove the photo and there was an amendment and asked strict under the rules stating animals are not babies we add to that so in any future cases people would know what to do\nWith it but they removed they they they did was it was culturally appropriate and the thing that people do and they decided to remove the photo yet that outraged individuals or editor certain wheeler\nWhy why did we make an exception because because when a problem grows large enough you have to change the rules if not we don't this was not one of those cases the juice wasn't worth the squeeze and like\nIf they were to allow this picture then they'd have to make some rule about when it was okay to breastfeed an animal and when it wasn't okay\nThis is a utilitarian document it's not about being right a hundred percent of the time it's about being able to execute effectively [noise]\nIn other words we're not trying to be perfect here and we're not even necessarily trying to be one hundred percent just or fair we're just trying to make something that works [noise]\nOne two three four five six seven eight and when you step back and look at what Facebook has become like from two thousand eight to now in just ten years\nSinger tower came in LA and\nOf the idea of a single set of rules that work that can be applied fairly that's just a crazy crazy concepts\nBecause they've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to be able to\nCount ballots said about eighty floors and\nThey've gone for twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nThere is a floor in the building where states such as sources content moderators itself\nAround twenty tend they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home and drawl as well as\nI mean I Would guess of their\nDublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack scene where they get there still is just so used to treat everybody fever English and we sent them\nThere to try to talk to some of these people who for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like [noise]\nWell I'm\nOf it we found out pretty quickly the none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nSo there's a lot of reading I mean happening\nAnd I'm Sorry sorry about the good work advice [laughter]\nSo now I don't I start you\nMost people wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's the is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk\nDo you want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather that that is totally fine you know I just landed history I don't want them\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nWhy and then we're not protected and black children or not that's not a good look\nIt's racist something's going on here there is absolutely some sort of an interest bias or systematic issue at Facebook hey\nI'm doing well thank you so much for being here\nNot long after sitting down with Marsha Facebook invited me to come out to their offices in California and sit down with that kind of just get your your name and your title and\nI'm Monica Becker it and I leave the policies for Facebook's\nMonika bigger is in charge of all of Facebook's rules including their policies on hate speech and so after like why would there be a rule that protects white men but not black children\nWe have we have made our hate speech policies\nLet me let me rephrase that are hate speech policies have become more detailed overtime but our main policy is you can't attack a person or group of people based on a protected characteristic characteristic like race religion or gender said\nThis takes a couple of decades to explain but the gist of it is that uh the Facebook borrowed this idea of protected classes a straight from us anti discrimination law these are the laws that make it so that you can't not hire someone say based on like their religion their ethnicity there a race\nAnd so on on Facebook you can't attack someone based on one of these characteristics\nMeaning you can't say men are trash nor could you say women are trash a because essentially you're attacking all men for being men or is it they all can I say Bob is ... you you can say Bob is trash because as my sources explained to me the\nDistinction is that in the first instance you're attacking a category in the second instance you're attacking a person but it's not clear that you were attacking that person because they are a member of a protected category\nOh so Bob might be trash for reasons that have nothing to do with him being man yeah he just might be annoying right okay so that explains why you take down ... but why would you leave up black children are scum well why would that not get taken up\nSo traditionally we allowed speech once there was some other word in it that made it about something other than to protect a characteristic\nIn Facebook jargon these are referred to as a a a non protected motto fire\nJust means literally nothing [laughter]\nGive us an example of this so traditionally if you said I don't like this religion cab drivers cab\nDriver would be the non protected modify or because employment is not protected category\nAnd so what the rules state it was a when you add this non protected modify or to a protected category in this case the cab drivers religion\nWe would allow it because we can't assume that you're hating this person because of his religion you actually just may not like a cab drivers\nSo in the case of black children children is modifying the protected\nCategory of black mhm and so children Trump's black their child ... Trump's their blackness you can say whatever I Want about black children\nWhereas in the case of white men uh you've got a you've got gender and race both\nProtected you can attack them\nThat's just a bizarre rule I Would think you'd go the other direction to the protected class would outweigh the\nModified well they they made this decision as they explain to me because of their default was to allow speech they were really trying to incorporate or not to the American free speech tradition\nAnd so there's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend as a valuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we say this is so\nBad we're going to take it down and in this case their concern was were all members of like you know at least half a dozen protected categories like we all have gender we all have sexual orientation and if you if the rule is that any time a protected class is mentioned it could be hate speech\nWhat you were doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone on Facebook to potentially be hate speech then you're left with anything right\nNo matter where we draw the line there are going to be some outcomes that we don't like they're always going to be casualties that's why we continue to change the policies\nAnd in fact since marshes debacle ... they've actually updated this rule so now black children are protected from what they consider the worst forms of hate speech\nNow our reviewers take how severe the attack is into consideration but despite this there are still plenty of people that is flawed because you are a social network including Marsha who who think they still just isn't good enough\nThere are not systematic efforts to\nEliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups\nShe thinks white men in heterosexual should not be protected\nProtect the groups who are actually victims of hate speech\nMakes sense well yeah because in sort of hate speech or or thinking about hate speech there's this idea of of privilege or of historically disadvantaged groups and that those historically disadvantaged groups should have more protection or because of\nBeing historically disadvantaged ... and the challenge with that uh that was presented to me was okay\nI have a thousand Japanese reinforced in the Nineteen forties cut off the Chinese and trying to\nYou had Japanese soldiers and those Chinese killing millions of Chinese during World War two [noise]\nAt the same time you had Japanese American citizens than a hundred\nThousand persons of Japanese ancestry all for that\nBeing put into internment camps and so we had to ask ourselves a question like\nAre the Japanese and historically advantage or disadvantage group huh Japanese Americans pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged but in China it's a totally different story and this happened at the exact same moment so you've got to different places to different cultural stories\nIn ... when you have a website like Facebook this trans National Community they realized what they decided that ideas of privilege are so geographically bond\nThat there is no way to live way way and consider who is privileged above who and decided therefore that we're not going to allow historical\nAdvantage or historical privilege or into the equation at all [noise] [noise]\nI think it's very important to keep in mind here and American these moderators only have like four or five seconds for Republicans come ... ... to make a decision or even the news in the force\nFrom time to to figure out where in the world someone is particularly given IP address is can easily be math\nGoing back where you came from is it enough time to figure out a person ethnicity white children are better on black children [noise] and on top of that we often don't know an individual's race strange people on the other categories or even less clear like sexual orientation\nAnd they they just ... it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively\nWhen we were building that framework we did a lot of cats and we saw some times that it was just too hard for viewers to implement a more detailed policy consistently they just couldn't do it accurately\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept\nAnd converted into a an engineering manual that can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe and when you've got to move that fast\nSometimes justice loses\nThat that um that's the tension here\nAnd I just want to make sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy peanut face but if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently\nBut it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white rule but when we come back\nThose rules they get toppled so\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P flown foundation in Hampton public understanding of

unilaterally cut off or substantially reduce foreign aid\nAre in short no the president cannot do that Congress has the power of the ...\nCongress appropriate the money\nAnd the executive branch is required to spend that Congress can make a decision to cut assistance limit assistance but I think it's important to point out\nThat the assistance that we've been provided to Central America for decades\nAnd particularly the increases in the last few years and you mentioned the increase in twenty sixteen that increase had bipartisan support both Democrats or Republicans recognize that the way to reduce migration\nA is to improve the lives of the people in Central America and Guatemala El Salvador to strengthen the capacity of these governments to reduce crime but the roost poverty and if we obviously be counterproductive if we were to cut this assistance because they'll just lead to more migration\nSo then the question is we we have cut that assistance and twenty sixteen it was seven hundred and fifty million uh and then twenty Eighteen the budget request is now down to four hundred and sixty million what gives their what's that about well\nThis isn't a minister ration that doesn't really believe in foreign assistance and the president who doesn't appreciate understand the value of foreign assistance you tend to see it as a gift\nAnd when he doesn't understand is that whether we're spending it in all Salvador Guatemala Honduras or other places around the world\nIt's really in the U.S national interest to be supporting these countries I think there were four reasons in particular are with regard to Central America obviously we're trying to reduce migration would do that by helping these countries to as I noted to reduce crime reduce poverty there are commercial reasons to support for an assistance as these countries\nAs people in these countries become will fears and move in the middle class they become consumers\nAnd they become for consumers of us products and that creates jobs the United states are there is also national security reasons there are drug trafficking organizations gangs operate in these countries and we have an interest in strength and capacity of these countries to to combat those organizations\nAnd again there are a humanitarian reasons I mean people are living in poverty in desperate conditions in these places and we have an obligation as a as a\nProsperous country to try to provide assistance to them\nIn four years after the migration crisis that caused President Obama will respond we seem to be in a similar situation and I'm Wondering is there any way to evaluate how much of the aid ah went and where it was supposed to go uh was the aid has he been effective\nThat's an important question and I think the id and other organizations do do their best to try to assess the impact will be no job offer one example uh USC idea a few years ago basically beginning a pilot study a pilot program and they looked at the areas of the country where there was some highest levels and crime\nAnd then they invested a a great amount in certain areas and then in certain areas they did not\nAnd they saw that the areas where they were investing where they were training police where they were\nProviding assistance to use and building youth centers and giving them up or providing them with a job opportunities and and and job training they found that in those areas where the investments investments were being made try prime went down in the areas where they've asked for not being made crime went up\nNow the key is obviously to scale up those programs are overtime and then to empower these countries to carry out the programs on their own but I think there is no good evidence that in many cases that the programs have been working but we have to continue to evaluate and we're programs are not working then you'd be revised are limited\nAnd there's also critics of the policy of U.S policy in Central America who would say that the U.S is partly responsible for a lot of the political climate that we see in these countries like Honduras what how do you respond to that\nWell look the United states has a has a checkered history in Latin America but I think in recent years the United states has been largely very supportive of democratic movements there have been supportive of human rights and I think there has been some setbacks and is a minister ration but I think certainly during the Bush administration during the\nClinton a bomb in his relations with a strong support for democratic movements are in the hemisphere and strong support for them to improve their governance\nUnfortunately I think we're seeing a diminishing of that now that that is this president and the smoothest ration does not put the emphasis on democracy and rights of the way the way in previous negotiations did look foreign policy is always a balance of\nValues and interests and this and this ration or puts puts the scale very heavily on nutrition and limits the importance of values\nWell but it also seems to be having a direct impact I mean the president is now threatening to cut aid as this caravan makes its way north\nWell look I again I think I'd be surprised to be honest if it if the system is in fact cut things and get some pushback within his own this ration people in the state department usa id department of justice da ... recognize the importance of supporting their partners and in these countries so I'd be very surprised\nOr if we do in fact see see see a kind of systems I think this is just simply lost her on the part of the president and his one of many simple\nBox here scene served as assistant administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean at usa id and he's currently the

J. C. T.\nLove about your show Planet Money what many on the surface of the show they can't really it's a show about how the world works\nAnd guy Ross well about how I built this is that it's about entrepreneur but it's really about people who have to read\nThis is more emphasis will now you can use your money and how I built this together in one hour and I'm pretty sure this is going to blow your mind\nHe didn't lay out the case and confirm some of the evidence as he did today knowing a little bit about him he's a pretty emotional guy so I don't think it's just you know pure politics but that is also an issue\nYou know turkey and Saudi Arabia have been at odds for five years since the coup in Egypt in two thousand Thirteen\nAnd that tension has gotten even worse with the rise of the young crown prince Mohammed bin ... on\nA who has you know close ties to some people are aired on ... and ... enemies including neo conservatives in Washington and so on\nAnd he sees NBS as the sort of weak link that he can hammer away at and so I think any a consideration of what Iran is doing what his timing is and so on has to take that factor into account\nNow we also know that the Turkish government um is as much as they are out outspoken about ... murder they have their own record on press oppression and do you think that that's part of the calculation here and ... response\nI think that's a really good question I'm not sure I'm not sure if he sees himself as a enemy of the free press you know he sees the journalists that he puts into jail and the newspapers that he shuts down not as ... as a free press but has\nYou know sort of hostile political organizations that are out to get him hostile players who are lying and smearing him and so on he doesn't see them necessarily as a free press and doesn't seem so is it\nA free press enemy but I'm sure that his ah handlers who have gotten a little bit better as of late are making that calculation\nWhat about turkey in terms of the rest of the region is it where does it stand or economically um what about the issues that it has itself with terrorism\nYeah I mean the the the the uh those or how to separate questions but you know a turkey economically is in trouble or it's the there are other Turkish throws down forty percent this year however one of the things that kept the economy from completely tanking\nIs a real estate and that's largely because of money pouring in from the Gulf and other countries\nIt also doesn't want to really really upset the Trump Administration\nThe director of the CIA was dispatched here yesterday we're not we're not we're not privy to what the conversations were but I'm sure some of the tone of what we've talked about was to the effect of please don't torpedo might have been some on we need him for our grand plan to confront Iran\nThen why are they really are why are they speaking out against ah what happened here it just seems like they were trying to have it too they wanted they\nAbsolutely and that explains a lot of what the Turks are doing they want to get rid of MPs or we can him at least an achieve some of their regional strategic goals in terms of torpedo ing this plan to confront Iran and possibly plunged the region into another war that that turkey is quite afraid of\nWhile at the same time keeping nuts slow of capital coming from the Gulf and keeping the U.S from punishing it over certain things including the case of the bank how bank\nOr has been indicted in the U.S and a face as a possible very very large fine for laundering Iranian money alright\nTurkish president air to one spoke today about the death of Jamal ... and we're talking about how that is playing into geopolitical relations in the region here on the take away\n\nFrom the takeaway comes from babble language rapid teachers real life conversations in a new language like Spanish and French or German battles ten to Fifteen minute lessons are available and the absolute or online at babble B a B B. E. L. dot com\nSell ... you mentioned that CIA director Gina Haspel is there in Turkey and I'm Wondering I Know those conversations are public but is there any sense that this could potentially help Turkey's relationship with the United states or what's this visit about more generally\nWell I think that you know turkey sense is that to some extent that it has a you know the U. S. right where it watch it on this case\nThey have the means or they think to really really weaken the Saudi alliance um the Saudi us Israel you a e Egypt sort of alliance that turkey perceived as being arrayed against it\nAnd the Trump Administration kind of perhaps panicking a little bit over what are the one might do may have dispatched the CIA director here to sort of try to talk reason to everyone saying look you know we don't have to do it this way please don't do it like this here's what we can offer and possibly some implicit threats as well\nAnd what about the Turks themselves um what's the reaction then if you can tell are they supporters are they are supportive of air to won or where to people stand right\nNow [noise] [noise] well I mean everyone is just totally intrigued by the story it's an amazing you know sort of crime story it's like a episode of the Americans or you know a some kind of TV serial ... kind of outlandish unbelievable sort of details that are people here are just gobbling it up\nBut I think on a broader political level you know you have various constituencies in the Turkish political body some of them support aired on and some of them don't\nUm but for various reasons all of them are United in this case a A N and wanting to know what happened to demolish rookie I think not least of all because she is of he's the Saudis citizen and an Arab but he's also a Turkish descent\nYou know in the in the Turkish newspapers they write his name or with the Turkish spelling Jamal ...
