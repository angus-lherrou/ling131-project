{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "During his night of torture near the delta town of money Mississippi fourteen year old Emmett Till's right I had been dislodged from its socket his tongue choked out of his mouth the back of his skull crushed and his head penetrated by a bullet\nAt the insistence of his family Till's body was shipped back home for burial in Chicago and Mimi till Mobley specifically called for an open casket\nDay and night over Labor Day weekend in Nineteen fifty five over one hundred thousand mourners almost all of them African American filed past that open casket which lay in state in the south side church\nBefore the funeral service a staff photographer from jet magazine was permitted to photograph Emmett Till's body and those images were disseminated to other African American magazines and newspapers including the Chicago Defender\nBut as historian Eliot jade Goran tells us in his new book on the Emmett Till case the mainstream press didn't reprint those photographs and of course they were considered too graphic for television\nYears later ... says many white Americans remembered falsely remembered the epiphany of pills ruined face in Nineteen fifty five\nBut few white people saw the photos until Thirty years later when the documentary eyes on the prize opened with the Emmett Till story\nOnly then did his mother's words let the people see what they did to my boy begin to be fully realized\nCorns book is called let the people see\nLike Timothy beat Tyson's twenty seven teen book\nThe blood of Emmett Till it builds on new evidence discovered by the FBI in two thousand and five\nTo present a detailed reconstruction of pills kidnapping and killing in Mississippi in retaliation for allegedly having whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant\nAnd also dives deep into a legal analysis of the transcripts of the trial in the town of Sumner, Mississippi in which Bryant's husband and his half brother were tried for Till's murder both men were quickly acquitted by an all white all male jewelry but\nWhat's most interesting about ... book is his final section called memory in which he traces how ... story which seems so well known today came very close to passing into oblivion\nGordon points out that in the two years following Till's murder more than three thousand articles about him were published\nThen the whole of the Nineteen sixties brought only three hundred articles in the Nineteen seventies fewer than fifty stories appeared\nJustice disturbing is the fact that some of those stories including one written in Nineteen fifty six by William Faulkner for Harper's Magazine relied on a paid interview with the two alleged killers that had been published in look magazine\nThat look story characterized Emmett Till as a defiant sexual aggressor\nGoing forward corn says the tenth and twenty fifth anniversary of Till's murder mostly passed on observed even in the black press\nIt was the rise of African American studies that helped to recover Emmett Till's story along with the widespread popularity of the Nineteen Seventy seven t._v. serial roots which proved there was a mainstream market for black history\nIn Nineteen eighty five a Chicago reporter named rich Samuels produced a half hour documentary on the till case segments of which were later broadcast on NBC's Today show\nFor the first time in mainstream media corn says whites saw the photograph of Emmett Till in his coffin\nAs the image appeared on the screen viewers heard the voice of writer James Baldwin who said\nIt was my self in that cough and it was my brother's in that cough and I can't describe it so precisely because it had been so mutilated it had been so violated\nIn with him but it was all of us\nLet the people see is a timely book about the fragility of collective memory\nAnd about the courage and persistence of journalists particularly black journalists some of whom risk their lives in Nineteen fifty five to get the facts of the ... story before the public\nMost of all though let the people see is a vivid reminder of just how easy it is for people not to see things they'd rather not see\nMarines ... teaches literature at Georgetown University she reviewed let the people see by Elliott Jay going\nTomorrow in fresh air we'll talk about how the Supreme Court became so politicized\nAnd how the court looks now with two Trump appointees and chief justice who's considered the most likely swing vote I guess we'll be David Kaplan author of the most dangerous branch he was the legal affairs editor at Newsweek I Hope you'll join us\n... ... ... ...\nFresh as executive producing as guinea Miller I interviewed some reviews are produced and edited they any salad ...

I I don't think you can do that right I mean\nThat's not legal yeah I I think that's probably not okay a but from the cops perspective they think that he's involved in a recent murder\nAnd a missing girl and they think that girl could still be alive so they want to know absolutely anything they can that's going to get them closer\nTo solving that murder and finding that girl but at the same time the defendant has to be able to share absolutely every thing with the lawyers and know that they're in that safe space a better relationship\nBecause we have sixth amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate oneself\nHistory checked freely ... attorney then you have no real justices\nAnd army in ... they need as much information about what Gary was done as they possibly can get so they can start to build their defense\nI don't like surprises I'm the kind that wants to know everything well so so that as a lawyer you're in a strange spot here\nHe needed to get from Gary out his story and it needed to be just that he didn't want the cops in on it yet and\nYou don't know if there were trapped in the room or what\nSo their turn off the TV turn up the fans but he was playing games you know talking basically about anything but but the case has kept saying he couldn't remember he couldn't remember and\nTrying to convince him like you've got to talk to us if you're going to have any shot\nIt's like a rich mambo the police pretty much have the cold there's witnesses and Guerra knew he could be going to prison he could be going to prison for a long time maybe twenty five to life and pedophiles prison you have to ...\nAll things get rough but they tell him if you talk to us\nMaybe we can get you not guilty by reason of insanity that was only two friends to help get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison that was the goal\nTo have anything to say say no\nIt took several conversations the get go to this point but finally Darrell cortisol out [noise]\nAnd what he said how he said it that's that's waiting on the other side of this very brief break we'll be right back\nHi my name is David David over and I'm calling from the Netherlands\nRadiolab is supported by ... an online service that lets people send and receive money internationally and they're all the ... let's customers hold and cool sued multiple currencies at anytime lord ... the cold and the\nCentral characters and trade radiolab supported\nPreventing future her a new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and\nFrom cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city future at heart available on apple ... for ever caught cats are found\n\nThere has to be a better way to do elections about compulsory voted in Australia or we could let children vote shouldn't they get to say\nWe can charge people money to vote\nOn maybe collection they should be a national holiday with parades and parties and cake\nElections to point out next time onto the best of our knowledge P.

[noise]\nSusan pets was from Chicago She's a girl I mentioned earlier the cops are already looking for her hoping that Carol might have some information\nEarlier that summer\nHer boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them had been camping and Susan had been gone ever since\n... she was a high school girl from Syracuse she'd gone missing just a couple of days before Susan everybody thought she might have just run away but\nGuerra told the lawyers that he had killed them and where he had left their bodies\nOne odd thing about the arrows description of the incidents she doesn't say I killed her she says she got stabbed with mine nights should stay with my life\nLike it wasn't even in doing the stabbing right like this is what do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself\nIs this true you know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be\nA dream he had it could be a delusion\nIf you're going to go and um you know craft an argument and present a strategy you need\nTo know uh what actually happened build you walk out the door he grabs Frank and he says he says let's go so they they slip outside they get in the car and\nWe take off to go look for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers\nThat Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mine ... mine ... about an hour south of the hospital ... head around me and in that moment where you scared were you excited like oh you you're up ... it's a high\nBut you're scared you're concerned yeah fear ... food if you don't\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose I Need to\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis may be as far as we can walk up to this whole band into my [noise]\nOne out there last February\nWith reporter Lauren my chemistry and\nTowns supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father system a road that goes to the mines or what is here to the more and it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nA very icy that day this hair is used to be an all roadway [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hill is fairly teeth are no leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they could've came in\nSo he comes in takes a seat\nAnd they asked them father father\nThere anything you can tell me about my daughter I mean the papers think that ... that Carol probably has something to do with their parents is there anything at all that he's told you that that can help me\nBut I couldn't tell him Andy thing an around he just he says no I Can't tell you there's nothing that can tell you what do you remember\nWe're trying to reassure him that look kind of meeting set up\nAll I can say is it's a state investigators and the prosecutor on the case\nThey could have some information for trying to give them hope that we will bring it to conclusion I thought he would\nWe did so then when Mr pets leaves his Romani he loses it needs through a bunch of books because for basically just you know destroyed his office just trying to relieve much\nThat I couldn't help them\nBecause he's looking right out this man knowing exactly well imagining what he's going through like our money had lost\nA brother his was much younger you for your job\nHas an air force pilot or three kids and in Nineteen sixty to his plane went down and he was lost at sea\nSo after that our money said his mother she'd be up at night crying she would like go to bed at night\nAnd my mother would wake up screaming for sure eating\nYou know she could liberal recover from because\nYou can't you know you just you don't really know but you know it's\nSo I can understand that\nAnd that's you know that's partly why this was so hard for our money because when that ... deal fell apart that was his chance to try to get this information to the families when the police all through he didn't have any other options for sharing that information he was stuck\nWhat so what happens next so they have to go to trial and that means that our money and don't you have to not go down to try to present an insanity defense meanwhile our money\nHe said he couldn't sleep he was having nightmares recover two thirty in the morning and sweat on and on your back go sit at the kitchen table drinking coffee and just waiting for the morning paper to come\nBecause he was just a loan or that he was alone with the secret and he knew that moment the police are trying to find these girls he knows that the parents are holding out hope that they might still be alive\nYou are you're questioning yourself very\nYou're hurting people so you begin to wonder am I in the right profession you know you're looking for and you're looking for ways to give the information is you know ... call\nSure\nWell [laughter] if I'm gonna do it and we're doing openly\nNo uh I don't know\nDid he ever did he ever break\nKnow according to him now you know in my mind\nWas doing was thought was a proper ethical and legal Morrow moral\nThing to do\nAnd then\nIn December of Nineteen Seventy three five months after the girls disappear their bodies happened to be discovered within two weeks of each other students bodies discovered by two kids are playing up in the mines Alicia I'm against us I think of students from Syracuse University which is right next door to the\nCemetery is walking through and stumbled upon her until she was discovered than to and then six months later in the summer of Nineteen Seventy four\nOpening day of the trial might be one of the most significant even though\nRobert ... trial for the murder of all the blue ski begins\nRobert Harris primary line of defense or apparently being not guilty by reason of insanity\nSo in order to make that case what they decided to do is is to put Darryl on the stand and he\nJust get the facts and Guerra would tell his whole life story to a shock the jury's mind including all these murders and all these rapes to see those even look at the time he was nuts Sharon Smith channel flicks\nNews in like ... so the trial opens um the courtroom is jam packed\nProsecution starts they have a really good case that got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton County and then it's time for the defense to start their case to Belgium stands up and he calls his first witness Robert De Niro to the stand\nGuerra gets on thin and he starts telling his life story and it's horrible [noise]\nSevere beatings and abused by parents very little education basically gets\nSent off to a farm to work like as an indentured servants when he's seven slaughtering bowls and he's eight years old weird stuff like that he started drinking blood I'm having sex with the animals and then he starts admitting to a series of rapes throughout his adult life and he\nAdmits to killing Alicia and Susan and what happens next and nobody's\nQuite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when ... talking about Susan pets ... says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found so the cat was out of the back then\nThe next day Belgian Armani will the press conference to try to explain why they hadn't told anyone\nFor bars with al ... cells the service because they had the duty to protect our clients secret but\nThey know the broad word here and they have created but\nEveryone is disgusted\nThose columns written editorials written letters to the editor\nOr just no way in the world you're going to convince your average non lawyer\nEverybody turned against them but this has anything short of shabby some very good of a lawn of justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors let out that our money and build you had actually tried to use these dead girls as leverage for Guerra\nThe headlines in the Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns on a game of law buzzer all\nOur money was getting death threats in the mail and I'd just as crazy phone call people calling saying stuff like how can you live with yourself I'm going to kill you only get to at one point he finds a dead fish in his car his wife ... Molotov cocktail in the back yard you started to carry a pistol ... Egypt shock on in the car he kept on in the house so\nWe could sleep it was that was the worst moment to or [noise] or some horrible for\nHis marbles it's\nJune twenty seventh rubber Guerra who was convicted for the murder of Philip bump whiskey he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life in a maximum security prison how did how did that feel for you\nRelief you know it's over would\nBut then it up to the grand jury itself in their investigation to determine which charges they should bring again to attorney\nPretty soon after the verdict our money and build you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice or\nState public health law and the provision that says that a body must be given quick in decent burial and on top of that\nOne of the ... the first one was a group of career was over there for work or\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against our money in Belgium so basically they were then facing disarming an investigation into the ethical complain that would drag on several years\nBelgium started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or money toughed it out but he suffered\nA no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or was like you know what else can I Do\nTo make a living\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the ... all all the stress and pressure you know churches to do\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar the Belgian our money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch\nAnd Frank our money is that our money is a real person and Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers\nAnd they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed\nI don't go with her well ... was a lawyer to do this job I was a good lawyer I saw so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a dead bodies case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nI think so he wasn't paralyzed he was not paralyzed he's faking it he was taking it for all those years for four years jeez yeah so he had a hit list apparently that was found in the cell it had the lawyers names on it I had the prosecutors and the judge I think had like a whole bunch of people are related to the case\nWith our money than when they're among his name was on their ... and bill jeez I'm really so\nSo he leaves and she goes where\nNo one knows but he's not in the immediate area as far as I can tell they pull out all the troops again they're searching this area that's like\nBrambles in dense brush around the prison and in the meantime this is our money's version I'm Henry McCabe same investigator from before during the manhunt shows up at his door tells him that girl has escaped again and says listen we had such a hard time catching him last time around\nIs there anything you can tell us this time it might help us and our money says like oh jeeze yeah I mean\nI think what he's going to do is hunker down right next to the prison is going to wait until he is going to be able to monitor you guys when he knows you moved on and cleared the area and he'll make or break for it and go so probably he's still right nearby\nYou should go back and catch him how does he knows that well so that's the thing he Daryl basically I think talked about that on the stand to he explained how he abated during the manhunt so it's possible that this wasn't news but our money claims that he told that to McCabe who thought it was helpful [noise]\nSo um they went back search theory again and sure enough he was there have popped up and he had managed to have a gun that had been smuggling him by his son a few days earlier and he shot the first officer that came near him and then all the officers opened fire on him and he was killed\n[noise]\nSocial look at where we land here like like this this is the small town lawyer who took on a case not because we want to do because he thought he should\nWho defended this fellow for all this time who suffered so for doing so many of his more or less give up his practice in small town it utterly changed his life and you're stuck to his guns and\nHe and he and he stayed with this guy and yet once she's escaped\nAnd he's at large and the police come and say tell us what you know about your client all of a sudden he does to you know go to the bushes and those will seize nearby like that's interesting because because basically after all this he more or less sets up the situation where the the kills his client\nYeah it's like why is it okay in the second scenario and not\nIn the first scenario with the buried bodies right yeah well interestingly Lisa learning the or the ... the law professor though we spoke with for this episode she says that when she teaches this case to her law classes um you know like even if you\nPresume that this was privileged information which ... says it wasn't because Garrett talked about on the stand but at least ... says even if it were privileged information and only\nArmani knew he could still reveal it in this case ethically really why\nBecause you go back and look at roll one point six which is the current ethics code it says a lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client\nTo the extent the lawyer reasonably believe is necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nSo you could quibble about this you know is this just to meet that standard but once Carol is on the loose\nYou know knowing what Frank knows about his having committed multiple previous murders\nMy reaction is that it was very reasonable\nBut in our case had the highway if he had not had a hit list and when she looked like he was going to murder more people if he had not threaten their lives if instead he was going to sneak out and simply go to ... on a plane and if he could get to it then\nOur lawyers would not have been able to tell them outside away place because no one was going to die\nYou know if I had been representing this man and he was on the loose than if I knew that he had killed several people\nAnd that he is\nA sociopath or something like that I Would I Would estimate the odds of his injuring or killing other people as very high\nBecause serial killers that's what they do\nYou know if it were another case and he was just going to run off someplace and there was no danger to anyone\nUh then maybe it would be different\nWhat is the argument that would be against that when we think are going to think of it the argument against that is\nEven if someone tells you a secret as his attorney or her returning you're supposed to keep the secret when there is a\nConclusion of the case and the person is either innocent or guilty how long must you keep the secret like forever set the forever forever why\nUh well the the the idea is that um if you want clients to be able to speak freely to their lawyers\nUm the the lawyer is simply the clients agent the lawyer has that information at the behest of the client it's not the lawyers decision\nTo reveal it\n\n[noise]\nThanks to our producers Brenner feral and ... and to a gym Tracey who's currently writing a book about all this\nThe working title his

song which are about I think that's what the you know when we talk about that you talk about it within the context of a feeling [noise] um and and definitely you have to do it yourself but there's there's a level human needs to happen\nWell we had this up in two thousand twelve we saw faith of all different communities come together and deal together and us can do what's going to happen going forward\nYou know there was a young lady who was quoted in a news report after the shooting at the synagogue who said\nShe was responding to the thoughts and prayers that are often told after a tragedy like this and she basically and I'm paraphrasing here said the place where I go to pray isn't safe anymore Mindy when the place\nThat God is supposed to be present in is a place for violence how do you hold onto your faith in that moment\nWell God is everywhere got isn't just in that place that when a building his belt and people are they're they're really there for community and they may be thinking that that's the only place that they can find God that that their mistake and they need to understand everyone should understand that God's everywhere\nAnd Mindy I'm curious for those um who have lost friends or family members are do you have any advice for them in dealing with the what they're dealing with in the upcoming days I Know some of the funerals are starting to begin if not I'm not mistaken today and I mentioned the president going down to Pittsburgh\n[noise] yes it has a responsibility at the president's responsibility\nTo be to be there and it's the president's responsibility and all years help people grave and what I Would say to the family members and the people in the community is similar to what I read in the letter\nIs right now you're in a fog right now the pain you think that is deep and and hurting is going to get deeper it it is a significant sorrow your lives are changed forever\nAnd I don't share cut it when I talk to people who lose family members from anything\nThat it doesn't just take time it takes effort to push to the grace from my face I pray more on my face I read more scripture I come in with people you\nBring the joy if I have people in my life it don't bring me joy or cuts me anxiety or stress I eliminate them from my life so you change your perspective on life significantly when something like this happens um so what I Would say to them it\nImmediately just let things take place and happened but in the coming months\nAnd a few years that's when you will see that you're going to be called perhaps God will call you to do something and have an action and\nSomething good come from this and I want people to listen to what we've done that's what our family has done by creating a foundation we created\nAnd pretty your advice for families who are dealing with this this week and beyond\nJust take less huge into into yourself your family or community though the billboard or community um it's it's almost a fake it till you make it type of thing where you're going through the portal calls\nA grieving you're going through you know making arrangements for the details of a burial of there's so many logistics that have to happen was going to happen is overtime that's going to go away and sort of the adrenalin of what is happening now and then the the lime light of being in front of cameras and putting other brave face will leave\nAnd that's one of them decided they left decided like well who who are there\nAnd the question will keep coming up keep coming up keep coming up and they'll they'll ask you to have that in her voice was no you're not just the person you're not a set of characters at a name you're not you're occupation you're not the label who are you inside\nAnd they will have discovered that they were more than they ever thought they were\nHaving I Want to ask you um I haven't obviously experienced is but I can imagine that must be a very difficult thing how how give us some tips on how to even process those emotions\nTips but are you actually have a a betrayal of assumptions and that's where my younger came from I assumed that ... would be a place of ... and it clearly wasn't then I have to go back to my roots and say what is uh what is my religion say what is what is my tradition say\nAnd I have to go back and realize that this prosperity gospel that's very popular country right now that that seems to be a Christian ... is a fraud an ally or God as a guy who's in the midst of suffering\nThe or guns on across the for the Christians um and and that has to be reminded that that's the route if it's in the suffering of human experience that we are most vulnerable that we will still open and we're most able to uh to really touch wood God is about\nThe many vengeance replaces forgiveness we put a wall of shame and predicts perfectly amid these horns clearing everything she sings same thing that we become as monsters as the shooter if we demand that retribution there has to be very difficult in our new cars I struggle with it\nBut ultimately I have to learn to forgive his actions to forgive him if I really hope to grow\nAs many corporate is the president to face always wins foundation pretty ... the author of the gift of our wounds and deacon Kevin McCormick is the principle of the very end high school and a Roman Catholic\nDeacon in Long Island Mindy

tax at twelve dollars a year to homeowners property tax bill for every hundred thousand dollars worth of value um as you said this is the only\nPacks of its kind in the country and it raises about twenty million dollars annually no that doesn't sound like very much but twenty million dollars is ten percent of all state appropriations and so that money help subsidize the cost for families who can't afford it it covers salaries and benefits for faculty and staff\nAnd the tax will be on the ballot for a time next week and what we're hearing is that supporters of the facts are really concerned right now because we are seeing these negative attitudes toward higher ed\nOkay so let's hear what some of the opponents are saying here to voters that you spoke with\nEvery time I see it on my property tax bill I go why am I doing that\nI've got friends that I've got two kids went to school because they are just as\nSoon as the issue here that it's just too expensive\nRight some opponents of the tax wise but with in Montana describe it as kind of a relic of the past they say taxpayers shouldn't continue to support system that needs to reform the higher ed is out of\nTouch with Sebastian of liberalism I mean I heard a number of concerns mostly from older property owners in Montana or they think that the system is over educating students that they are leaving the state and also enrollment is down or flat across the whole system so\nA lot of voters are asking why should we as taxpayers continue to fund public colleges if the Romans dropping\nAnd you also spoke to Steve bullock who's the Democratic governor of the state of Montana here's\nA little bit of what he had to say popular climate might be to say well let's not be paying for the public good to we'd need I think fundamentally here in Montana still the importance of higher education to our overall state is recognized\nBully gives them interesting politicians who is a red state Democrat while Trump won by ... percentage points he won by just four percent bullied may not want to say this or see this way but this vote I think tells us something bigger and broader about how the public perceives colleges and it seems like\nMany of the voters I spoke with do not necessarily see higher ed is a public good but as a private gain you know he may want to\nPaint this as a Montana tradition but they still have to go out there and really make the case for why taxpayers are continuing to fund it\nIs this a Montana specific ideology that you're hearing or is this something that's more broadly I'm accepted across the United states just I'm thinking about how in New York for example in New York state we've had this big a fight about making public universities more accessible\nRed and blue states we're having this debate about making higher education tuition free or at least debt for it but most of the economists I speak with say we're so far away from that ... that first we just have to make it affordable and if you look at the Academy of arts and sciences and some of the studies they've done on state funding since two thousand eight\nStates have cut funding by about on average by about thirty percent per fulltime student and once they've cut back that shift the cost to students and families of taxpayers are picking up the bill someone else has to pay for it so I think it's one thing for Bernie Sanders um our other progressive politicians to tout free college\nBut when you look at the reality our country is moving in the opposite direction\nKirk Carapezza as managing editor of our

otherwise known as the salmon initiative\nNext week voters will decide whether to increase regulations to protect salmon habitats or keep the status quo Elizabeth ... a reporter with Alaska Public media and Alaska's energy desk and she joins me now from Anchorage Hi Elizabeth Hi there thanks for having me\nTo tell us what is ballot measure one\nIn general it's aimed at increasing I'm making stiffer the permitting requirements for projects development projects in salmon habitat it's quite complex is this good or bad for salmon\n[laughter] good question and even that is controversial everything about this initiative is controversial here in Alaska but in general it's aimed at setting up kind of a tiered permitting system you would have\nMinor permits for what the proponents say are smaller projects and then for a bigger projects your mind or dance or oil developments those would have to go through a major permitting process and the idea is that that would be much stiffer permitting process with more opportunity for public comment\nLet's talk a little bit about who's on both sides you spoke to Carl Lee ... who worked for an Alaskan environmental group and what did she tell you\nSo proponents of this initiative I'm One of their big arguments is that salmon is an incredibly precious resource to Alaskans in Alaska is kind of one of the last place in the world where we have these really rich wild salmon fisheries\nWe've seen all over the rest of the world what happens when we don't protect onshore habitat where salmon spawn and they're gone um Alaska has Sam and this is actually the last stand for wild salmon on the planet here in Alaska but\nBeyond that I'm for a lot of Alaskans including Alaska Native people they're relied on for subsistence um people rely on them for food and there are also a huge cultural importance so proponents say that this measure puts in place some needed protections to make sure that we preserve those fisheries\nBut then there are folks on the other side I'm for example Joshua kindred who works for the Interior Department and used to represent the Alaska Oil and Gas Association and he's not to sold on this\nVery this initiative is about saving salmon and not about stopping development is [noise] and so it's an emotional appeal to Alaskans because everybody wants to love salmon but this has nothing at all to do with him\nThis ballot initiative has gotten a lot of pushback from unions from Alaska Native corporations the oil and gas industry the mining industry they're big message is not that they're against salmon nobody in Alaska is against senator will say that they're against salmon and protecting them and\nTheir argument is if this initiative goes way too far\nToo far into foreign what Elizabeth\nIn the sense that because of this kind of toughened up permitting process it would slow development um it could potentially prevent developments from happening and then it could open the door to more litigation which definitely could slow or potentially halt projects that are up against a lot of opposition\nHow to ordinary Alaskans feel about the ballot measure I think ordinary\nAlaskans have a very complicated feeling about this ballot measure of course you have some Alaskans who are very pro industry pro the mining industry for the oil industry they're going to vote against it then you had Alaskans um who wants salmon prioritized above all else and they are going to vote\nFor it and then I think most Alaskans are really grappling with this initiative they're not sure if\nIt goes too far or they're not sure if what we have in place right now isn't doing enough to protect that we have and because the initiative itself is kind of complicated there's a lot of confusion about what it will do and you know I've talked to many Alaskans who I respect who who are really really grappling with is\nIs there one side that's more heavily funded than the other\nAbsolutely um stand for Alaska but no one one that is the industry supported coalition\nHas raised well over eleven million dollars um which is more than any of Alaska's gubernatorial candidates combined\nThe pro ballot measure one crowd has raised a little over one million dollars but because there's no public polling on this I really don't have a clear sense whether all that money that the people who are against the initiative have raised\nWhat impact that will have at the ballot box it it's hard to tell at this point ...\nElizabeth ... a reporter with Alaska Public media and Alaska's energy desk thanks and listen to think
