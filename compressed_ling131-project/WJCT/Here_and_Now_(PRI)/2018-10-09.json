I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today the [noise]\nWe're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something pie\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nAt the same as that was taken in the scene at this woman came up to me who is hosting the event her name is ... brown\nI Do I Try to do something like that in the air and I'm On his animal\nTall black woman long dreads piercing have allies in relation to violent\nAnd I don't I don't know Marlon story\nI'm Marlon is three years my age I'm thirty in the morning and he was and they thought that when you see them\nIs on probation for drug charge income with painkillers so he ran and immediately the cop car followed him and eventually Marlon flip hell of a cop car hidden\nHours for five hours yeah yeah\nChrysalis neighbor's got the team and we sat and laid it four or five hours\nUntil they were able to get the child [noise] mine was pronounced dead [noise] until ... when I talk for a little bit and buy a\nHouse or just walking around start induced myself people were you guys from Florida\nTampa, Florida are you from Tampa okay so we just made the drive and I don't quite know what I was expecting I guess I just thought it was you know going to be a local event for this one person but\nI just started meet people I started meet people from all over from Tampa from Palm Beach whereabouts in New York I mean there were people from all over the country is flat ... Brooklyn Chicago Georgia and yeah\nI started seeing these people who win the T shirt insurance and then you have to do with the big picture of a young black man's face or a name that\nThey represent aimed watch and\nThere was one woman with a picture of her son's eighth grade graduation photo on her shirt is capping down\nAnd read he was fourteen years old when he was killed he was buried in Spain\nHis down met another mother is going on for years so I have maybe about ... ... where the name of a twenty three year old son running Mitchell on her shirts at one with the graduation speech I have the right than black and yellow one I have this Jamaican color what I have a black and white I have ...\nI certainly shirt after shirt after sure and I think by the time like forty people showed up in there all these different shows I I just realized like\nOh this is not just a thing for one person this is a network\nLike almost everyone there had lost either a cousin or a brother or a\nHusband even even daughter to ... and in fact when I later sports one of those women you just heard at one with the graduation from touching Clemens twenty three year old son Roger Mitchell he was shot and killed by ... eastern new traffic so we're actually going to get into that story later but she\nTold me that I've met about four hundred other mothers they'd reached out to me and I were a hundred oh yeah really yeah true like traveling around through Facebook I've met ... other mothers who lost their children [noise]\nSo I was just seemed like a fraction of a community center got the scales rising rate and the other thing for me was how you see these stories pop up thirty seven year old Alton Sterling forty year old parents ... I'll be the ones that get pulled up to like a national level and you see the family members come out and man\nHo ho ho baby\nFor like two days you see them on television that big bad\nThat big bad dude\nThen they kind of recede\nThey're gone I guess what I thought it you know probably they have these long drawn out legal battles and then [noise] you know they go back to their lives whatever like whatever that means\nBut instead it's like oh no what happened is they get like folded up into this network\nThe ... the little\nAnd so at the community center there was a moment of prayer where the forty to fifty people sat down at these big around dining tables because\nOnce upon a time of all the ...\nHarmless or is it hot dogs you know we're just for low for the students\nAnd so after the prayer Christel House in back in the room for everybody to eat so everyone stood up\nBy just totally changed in somebody put on some M. J. and a lot of people started crowd around these two big picnic tables\nWhich where I met this woman I mean the only comment I was looking for early you could just described for me what we got on the table 'cause I'm just a one on the table yeah just went on I mean this the table right here so I think you have to have you have your own\nYou've got your aims you get your Britain and you've got to a bank and you've got your thought gee you got everything you want to have to get nice good old are they\nGoing to get him a show in Geneva reveal I'm the mother Sandra ... case you don't remember [noise]\nSeen her plan is pulled over in a small town in Texas the cop runs or information comes back to the car but not your cigarette please\nAre lost it right out of the car and I have the right I Do have a right now I Will remove him get her move for\nFor our movie I'm giving you a lawful order\nOr\n\nA car and you know mentally senior gets out of the car or fail you know you don't often it's\nSandra was eventually taken in jail for days later in that jail cell she was found dead\nHang with the plastic garbage bag the death Israel to suicide and sinners family disputed that ruling\nYou got everything you want to have to get\nGoing to get him a show in Geneva reveal I'm them other than to\nRain coming from I ... I Want to let you or your food I one thing I wanted to have you come to come to events like this before Oh yes sir\nUs in Missouri last we um we go all around\nWe tried to support it made him other than we can because\nIt's important that exactly like is that what it is it really just like a\nYes or it's a good point because that mother who has lost their baby needs to be able to see somebody else who looks like\nIn the same situation and they are as opposed to someone walking up to them and saying I Know how you feel but you really don't [noise]\nWhich made me think about something better than I had talked about a lot which is in getting to meet these women and talked to these women\nYou get the sense that their their experiences is really unique\nSort of law it's up to lose somebody that cancer I've lost a friend the cancer recently in fact\nIt was a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his first wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person is killed by another human being in that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ...\nSo it's it's just weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or no no just wanted to know was\nAnd has been telling everyone about them\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but thinking this must be part of the different types of learning is a part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find a way it was a crystal gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the larger stage a certain point because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nAnd what happened was we went to the same with these women mostly black who have lost people to police violence and I'm sitting across the table from an African American city councilman Daytona Beach and I told him what I've been working on I told him some of the numbers we'd learned and he said you really need to meet our police chief\nShells same as my chit win or just yeah just I'm like okay it's a piece chief of Daytona Beach\n[noise] known for a while to rocket spring break scene [noise] ah they have bike week the draws five hundred thousand bikers from all over the country [noise]\nDaytona international speedway\nOn top of that the permanent population there is like sixty two thousand people and over that six year period they've only had four police shootings\nAnd that's low yeah for a city like that that's really low\nI Need to break down ... points the and in fact what we were there by race of tickets at a rest\nCuban has a system print out these spreadsheets there were others there the stats they get to do the math and these ... it's actually kind of fascinating 'cause if you look at them you know when you just go right down here and you can add 'em up for things like aggravated aggravated assault theft shoplifting or speeding\nOr arrest ratio and our ticket ratio basically mirrors our city in terms of racial demographics yeah we're we're roughly a sixty forty shitty sixty percent of white ... percent African American\nAnd so when you look at these numbers it's pretty much what you see a tickets for speeding about sixty forty arrest for theft about sixty forty that's the way we are supposed to in theory approached law and so what are they doing differently well a whole bunch of things first of all\nWhen all these these incidents were occurring in or\nAround the country with ... and everything else we did a race and policing mandatory training for the entire pd and basically what we wanted our officers to do is number one to learn the history of the country was history of the country is that we are racist nation number I Want to look at it started with moving the Indians\nOff of their land for manifest destiny or when you look at Jim Crow laws when you look at the civil wars yoga slavery when you look into it Bull Connor for example\nOf turning the dogs and fire hoses loose on civil rights marchers so it's important for officers to understand that that you may go into an African American community and you may think an accent talk away where you think you're being respectful and understanding but in reality you're not\nBut let's not for a moment think that there isn't biased in in policing because there's bias we all have biased in is a an a trick is at and I don't know what to trick at a I don't know of any of us knew how to contain that how do we stop that bias from coming for when you make a decision\nAnd I think in a you know I've read a lot about implicit bias and always seems like I'm like I say feels like a kinder way to say here like a fear of a black person and that fear is greater than what you would feel when you're encountering a white person when you're out on the job as a cop\nWhen you look at some of the shootings you record on video and I and I think of the poor school janitor who lost his life in Minnesota oh the clinic still shooting yeah there's a guy who told the officer in no uncertain terms I'm a good guy\nI have a gun permit you can't get a gun permit if you're a convicted felon and you can't get a gun permit if you're a drug dealer\nSo when the minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit for some unknown reason that officer ... threat level with a baby in the car and I got a guy and his ... his kid his girlfriend in the course don't miss a gun permit older\nThis is this is an easy cost up for some reason in ... and the reason is because of the color of the main skin all those things never registered black guy receivers by his pocket and I should\nAnd and I would like to tell you and all my years in policing I Would like to sit here and be not even tell you\nThat we don't you don't want people and a twenty eight year practitioner law enforcement a second generation cop I'm appalled at what I see when those videos I could not believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control\nSome of them I understand what's going on I mean wrestling in the ground for your life and you and and you know there there are times that we have to use deadly force but the incidents in South Carolina the incident Minnesota I mean are you kidding me looking at what are we doing\nI mean how do you how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop they're not already operating at this level of heightened fear or this perceived threat\nIn my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound you have to train using in real life scenarios\nThat take that extra split second before you fired your weapon and I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people\nAt a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled removed you would jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had a ... trained on how to keep your finger on the side played the weapon\nNot on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody\nAnd you weren't a thought it was warm and getting oh my God they're gonna get killed one reality what he did was each slow down your field division it's slow everything down that split second didn't make a difference that blink of an I didn't make a difference it made a difference and you're not shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been\nThat the color of my glass coming out of my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that she would come back to again and again is this idea of time in certain situations slow down\nWhen you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down like whatever you can do you cover just create some space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between you're saving your life in somebody else's life another interesting thing was in Ben Ben found that said also through some of the reporting with other police chief\nIs the idea that some ... cheese don't like to hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds in part because everything if there was this the text alive\nIs only know how to communicate is like this and then when it when they look up and go to talk to somebody and and I'm Serious about was it the drive through at McDonalds and they could piss off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nIn fact been told me that he talked to different police chief who told him the young people who are coming into the Academy of past years\nHave never been in a physical fight which is a problem because when they get into a fight their hearts stretch the race in their muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and then way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapon to uh you know\nTo to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on you know so that then says that that's why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bounces or for chip what he said from\nJust my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they were my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the\nPolicy basically you know how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important thing she says\nIs you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff but we they bought Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day\nYou have to get to know people yeah for sure and so to make this point it would get up walking down the hall to another office\nOr send me down on the computer the sound comes out of us when we say it's okay\nTo show me the video to video starts\nIn silence and its body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as your side is partner both cuts are white also it's night so [noise]\nCause for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people he was off his meds if he was going to crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly they park neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away\nThis shirtless black guy and you show up there\nThat's the kind of talking on the cop were in the body can end this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand and he's walking towards the ... once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the body chemicals out the ... the other officers out it was added a frame is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching approaching approaching a protein and he gets within like ten feet at the cops and then [noise] the guy was\nFighting him fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand hey\nHey you're going to get it\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he hustles over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central for cops and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot I wanted to your best shot and I say if you want a guy you want a guy you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of our parents really want to\nBe to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car put them in and the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up and the guy leans in the current judge that when I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first\nWarn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nHe's behind that little bad she's a bully\nIs that what you think of cops like writ large that's how it is\nThat's exactly how it is not ESPN and buts about it\nBecause it's hard for me because I think like\nLike it's clear that there's discrimination with that exist within the police force\nAnd the people who they are sworn to protect and serve but like at the end of the day there's probably a hands like oh I don't know I couldn't give you a percentage but a number of officers\nIn which like yes they are probably Vineland individuals who don't belong in a police force but I Would assume that like a majority of the cops mean well\nProbably probably have some sort of biased where they don't think I see a black person and I'm like\nI'm going to get that boy\nBut that there is like a like there's some sort of triggered response\nAnd and that the police\nAre constantly being put into different situations where they feel under threat\nAnd concerned\nAnd that like it just like a whole host of factors leading to these moments where somebody is shot and killed it's not just that they're out here bowling people that\nYou say that because you're you're white\nI tell you what we can try this\nGo to my sister will make sure we could each week they'll ten Islam hit yourself spray black and I guarantee you get a different response\nAnd there you try I bet you we can make you look ahead of that boy I'm telling you\nLike sitting like sitting there\nI felt I felt the Gulf\nHow long does it take to fill that Gulf like how

upper eighties heat index values around a hundred degrees [noise]\nA new report from the United nations says we're much closer to the edge of climate change disasters and we re alive so why aren't we more concerned\nOne scientist put the urgency of the greenhouse potential in biblical term snowing new trouble was telling me he said any prepared for the planet is on the brain [noise]\nI can see the Vegas and this is the takeaway also this hour the impact of natural disasters on poverty in America it was just deja vu for these threats that and the damage was just horrible lots of the last day to register to vote in a third state [noise]\nSome Americans why are we still experiencing this disconnect has the politics really taken over to the point where we don't see a solution to this\n[noise] well it's difficult for people to connect to their personal experiences which as you say are happening right now right eastern North Carolina\nThe western United States that's being impacted by fires communities around the United states that are experiencing water scarcity or heat waves right so people are experiencing impacts right now\nBut it's difficult for them to connect those personal experiences with this abstract phenomenon\nLike when you hear Megan say that I'm Wondering how it looks to you as a scientist why you think we haven't seen more political action towards climate change policies in this country\nI have a slightly different view because agree that there is a disconnect us when we talk about climate policy about what people want in fact there was a public opinion poll large public international public opinion oldest says or sixty six percent\nOf people believe that climate change is a serious international problem that's pretty sad that only sixty six percent believe however the good news was\nOver eighty two percent of the people of a world this was a ... twenty six thousand people in fact in countries\nBelieve that we should the rural to transition to a hundred percent clean renewable energy so people do not necessarily believe in climate change but they do believe in a transition to clean renewable energy and you could even see that in the United states I mean nine out of the top ... states in the United states are all in Republican led states\nAnd many there are over eighty cities and towns that have committed to a hundred percent clean renewable energy there are a hundred and forty international companies including all the large companies will the world have committed to that\nSo I think the excuse not to talk about climate change the reason people believe in clean renewable energy and not necessarily about climate change just because\nThey think the clean renewable energy will free more energy independence or will reduce air pollution problems people are more concerned about air pollution than they are about climate it'll create more stable energy supplies in the long run and also brings costs down I mean the cheapest forms of new electric power in the United states today\nAre onshore wind and large scale solar power\nAnd they're even half the cost of natural gas so the reason people are transitioning despite their not believe in climate change just because it's cheaper and it's getting cheaper by the ...\nBut that appears to be an continues to feel like a major disconnect between you just mentioned mark that Republican states there's some of the ones that have the best a wind and renewable energy resources right now that seems very much in contrast at least with what President Trump was saying pumping up things like coal country right\nWell yeah exactly so she's talking a lot of doing that but the fact is because the economics are so good people are transitioning and entertainers despite all his rhetoric coal plants are still being shut down what\nAbout big business making I'm curious if you can help us understand that a little bit where do they play into this narrative about climate change\nWell they exert a lot of influence on our politics right and that industry structure and our political structure is still favoring that businesses that have historically dominated the energy industry\nAnd so in order to convert the sort of individual activities and the economic activities that mark when describing before in order to convert that into policy activity then these businesses need to exert political beliefs\nAnd so far there's been some hesitation to do that why is that\nI think a lot of it is that it it is this sort of emerging industry right so there are lots of different player that's not concentrated and a few actors\nBut that's part of what needs to happen right exercising our voices and saying this is an issue we need you to prioritize right it's not just a concern one of many but it has to be the top concern for politicians looking to to set their agenda is right\nOn because we're not seeing many of them in the lead up to the mid term elections really putting this at the top of their agenda\n[noise] they're not right and right now there's not a lot of political cost in ignoring it\nMark I'm wondering we sort of touched on this but I'm Wondering what can\nEveryday average non governmental a decision making Americans do hear those of us who are thinking we're doing the right thing by using the nylon bags and the plastic ... the not plastic straws et cetera et cetera what can we do\nIf anything and it's just this is a problem that feels way bigger than us but I Know people want to do better how can they\nRoll there are things I mean there are throughout the United states there are what are called community choice aggregation utilities cropping up you can actually choose to a utility that actually provides all its electricity from clean renewable energy up to a hundred percent of its fortress from wind and solar and geothermal power\nSo that's an option that a lot of people should take I mean and the price of electricity has virtually the same it's really virtually the same\nIn most places if it's different might be different point or one since ... when you know\nSo that's one thing but then you could also part of your own home it's a lot of people are putting solar on their own roots or batteries in their garages and anything in your own that uses gas which was a stove go induction hooked up so I mean there are ... and they they boil water and a half the time as a guest they're either\nIn terms of cars or go to electric cars I mean the rangers now three hundred miles and more than whether rising your own making sure you don't have a lot of heat energy efficiency is the cheapest form of energy so\nI'm going to keep these things in mind Marcus I I'm I Am now shopping for appliances myself so I Wish I had\nMark

issue why or why not\nTerri and I'm from out here in Oregon climate change is always a priority when voting\nI have a daughter works in climate science in the newest un reports true that Trump and his

Minnesota climate change is number one first and always if we don't deal with climate change what else is there\nTitus ... from central Illinois my number one issue in November when the term limits my

next MORNING EDITION from NPR tomorrow\nMuch bigger causes at play here and I look forward to learning more about what happened\nWhat would you say were some moments that stood out for her and maybe some places where she had some challenges\nWell to me ambassador Haley whether it's moderates are not at that will depend on your perspective but I saw her as a pretty conventional thinker and voice for American national security interests she valued alliances she\nWanted to push back on um some you know Iran and North Korea she talks democracy and human rights on Russia She was a strong voice pushing back on Russia and in a different administration that would seem very normal and nothing particular about that in\nThe Trump Administration it seemed extraordinary because the president\nHas so many different views on those things particularly with respect to working with our allies\nAnd particularly with respect to Russia and particularly with respect to democracy and human rights where they were often times at our thoughts on those sets of issues so I see her as representing a lot of continuity in American foreign policy a but serving a president that does not\nEven mentioned that ambassador Haley had been outspoken and human rights\nI'm ... compared to others in the administration but she's also defended President Trump multiple times them perhaps most notably when\nA he was laughed at during his un speech I'm Wondering if you know anything about their relationship the relationship between ambassador Haley and President Trump\nWell of course she did and that's what any ambassador serving the president should do but let's be clear she's resigning [laughter]\nMaybe that says something about how she really felt about the president and the policy and you know the in the press conference I was very strange I thought all the praise worthy language back and forth I think over time\nWill probably learned that there was much more I mean you know that oftentimes there were disagreements both about the substance and about the style of conducting American foreign policy and and if there wasn't why is she resigning now it makes absolutely no sense to me otherwise\nYou know those cultural words are actually interesting given a twenty sixteen tweet from the president where he says the people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley\nWell that's right I'm an expert on foreign policy not American electoral politics but I just find the timing to be extremely\nA bizarre number one and number two I I just think it means that shift away from what I think is more kind of sensible middle of the road foreign policy where we've had consensus about working with our allies\nAnd talking about our values and ambassador Haley or I think reflected that consensus in at a time when the president doesn't and I worry we're going to be or even further away from what I think are important things to stand up for\nAnd that's that are Michael McFaul served as US ambassador to Russia from January twenty twelve to February twenty fourteen ambassador thank you for being with us shirt thanks for having me\n[noise]\nOn friday Chicago jury found Jason Van Dyke guilty of second degree murder\nVan Dyke was the white Chicago police officer who fatally shot Seventeen year old declined McDonalds who was black sixteen time for activists this was an overdue victory just a small

hundred and one thousand times each and every year in on duty police officer shoots and kill someone at agencies all across the country and by my count a Ninety three officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter resulting from an on duty shooting since two thousand and five so it's it's very rare\nThat an officers charged it all and it's even more rare that an officers convict

to the take away or you don't [noise]\nWhen you hear from people in your community about the hiring of Timothy low man what are they saying\nOh there are they're very appalled it's um it's outrageous most people were horrified um and most people are hurting the water and a lot of people are confused and mambo hold a but honestly it doesn't surprise me from being from this area and things have gone on even in the past\nSomething similar to this it um I just thought the system is very sick in the in fact the way in competency\n[noise] what are the things that we should note here is that police officer Lohmann was fired from the police department in Cleveland and before that from the police department in independence Ohio he was not fired however for the killing of Tamir Rice he was fired for lying on his job application\nAnd then he was cleared of all wrong doing in the case does that do anything to alleviate any concerns about hiring him\nIs it is horrific is\nBlows my mind to the point where how can an officer a ... and his files that he lived for one like you said he had incidents of ends ordination inability to uh mostly function that he was labeled as unfit to serve and then our city have the audacity to even consider hiring somebody that is inadequate and unqualified\nInefficient maybe the chief of police here should be getting his background checked\nWhat's interesting is that we did reach out to the ballet or police department for comment and they did not respond um but the chief of police who hired Lohmann his name is Richard Flanagan said it's not fair to quote unquote crucify Lohmann your reaction\nThat is horrible but I can I can understand that it comes from somebody like that when you can go on YouTube and look up Mr Dick fight again\nAnd look up officer fight against screaming profanity is that a person there is a video out about that two thousand fourteen I don't think he ever got reprimanded for TV shows that he's ... abuses power
