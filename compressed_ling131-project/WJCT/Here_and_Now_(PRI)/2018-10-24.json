[noise]\n[noise] oh\nI was waiting for something that happened that never happened which was the white people bring up slavery or at least to talk about how Henderson was conceived they never brought up slavery I\nI I was like well wonder why people ever bring up some ... other than to be sorry that happened to someone else I think\nTo bring of slavery in the context of their family to somehow connect their ability to have a formal education or the life that they do\nI still don't know if they made the connection between who they are and how they became who they are the wealth that was afforded them the opportunities I think one is too painful too it's too embarrassing\nAnd it feels so so distant but I wouldn't have my last name word not for slavery and so I I never expected them to to bring it up and in the first meeting I wasn't sure how ready I was\nSo two days ago just two days ago I called John ... up on the phone you're coughing and we only talk for like ten minutes but I play a little snippet of a ... sure\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] good morning harkens florist is John\nJohn this is Charles from to the best for knowledge how are you sir okay are you ready to chit chat about a family history I Am indeed you met your gi relatives that were descendants of Henderson gee how does it feel to meet him\nIt was just a wonderful coming together beautiful people and um I had only heard a few months earlier of Ender's\nYou analogy seemed to have connected and you have such a powerful history together have you ever thought about what would be like if you had switched places I mean what if you are the descendant of Henderson and he was the center of Robert ... have you ever consider that\nI Would be a very angry first\nWhy do you think you'd be angry\nThe injustice of at all\nI'm looking at the pictures amazing photographs of Robert your gi descendent of Henderson Alex's G to send it\nAnd look at these two photos and I can't help but just to see pain in American history and privilege when you look at these photographs now how do you see these two photographs\nI see more of the commonalities than than the distinction I don't own the surface\nThe black quite as this irreparable cash when Alex and I sit down and we spent the whole day together\nI found more commonality in\nA situation where people are not able to deal with each other\nAlex Reverend gee what about you do feel commonality of looking at those photographs you must be in a moment driving back in the car maybe when you're like oh I Wonder what it would have been like if I was in the Senate and the other brother of the white brother is still a gee did you even think about that\nMhm I often think that if my accomplishments I'm a published author things I've started created a nonprofit created the movement if I were white doing what I'm doing I'd be a hero ... and so yeah I think that if I were our elves great great great grandson given some of the resources that they were given\nTheir days where I think man I could be a U.S senator ... today I can be the president of the university and then I'll flip in sync I'm only fifty four\nAnd I'm interested in great great grandson and I can still do that stuff and not attributed to being white privilege ... I've got something inside me\nThat's allow me to catch up my daughter's a pre me and the nurse told us to sort of watch it because the previews always feel the need to catch up like they know that their development is delayed but there's an eternal mechanism that just makes them just want to catch up crawl walk et cetera et cetera\nI feel like a cultural ... like something inside me just looked around and said\nYou know I got to be the faster they got to be the strong because I've got to show that what people think about me or people who look like me is not true and I feel like\nSitting at Johns table that pre me pause and said you know what maybe I've caught up caught up\nBut to sit there is a black man in field like I don't have to play catch up was redemptive that was worth the ancestry dot com feed that was where I Lived down to New Orleans but to sit there and say I could I left that meeting in that space feeling\nThey were all children basically selling\nTime than these girls during the time that Jefferson is they are the younger daughter dies and Jefferson at this point and determined to have his other daughter brought to him but he asked for her to come over with\nHe says a careful negro woman instead Jefferson sister in law who in this convoluted story was also Sally Hemings his half sister because Jefferson's wife and Sally Hemings were half sisters they had the same father shame well for the same white father John Wales\nAnd they sent her over and Sally Hemings is fourteen at this time\nAnd Polly the younger daughter is about nine so she is the sort of caretaker companion slash to pilot and at some point during this time period Madison Hemings said his mother became\nMr Jefferson's concubine as sort of interesting because everybody called him Mr Jefferson when they're speaking to other people\nAnd France was not free soil in the sense that you set foot in France and you were immediately free but everybody who petition for freedom in France had the partition granted so James and Sally Hemings could've remain there and they thought about doing it\nThis is fascinating I mean do they are slaves back in Virginia in Virginia ... in Paris presumably they just need to petition for their freedom and they could be free\nThat could be free people and I think Jefferson was on the defensive about this because he does something that he continues later on but he pays them wages while they're there\nOne of the things I'll never know obviously but I'd like to know how they presented themselves because these are two people who might have been able to pass for white\nLight skinned their light skinned people and they could well have presented themselves as just servants to Jefferson without this other overlay\nOf slavery so yes they could have had that Jefferson according to Madison Hemings wanted Sally Hemings to come back with him and promised her that she would have a nice life at Monticello and that their children would be freed when they were Twenty one\nAnd of course the other side of this is by the time they go back to America Sally Hemings was pregnant yes with Jefferson's child and she's sixteen years old mhm mhm which you're going to do I suppose if she stays in Paris I mean that would be pretty tough\nTough but if you were there with James I know someone is actually working on a sort of alternative ... novel about Sally Hemings staying there\nOne of the things that could have happened is that she could have stayed there with Jefferson Secretary William short was anti slavery who remained in Paris and remained in Europe for a number of years you know she could have been made to him James could have been the cook for him [noise] yes it would have been tough but you know it could have been tough back at Monticello if he hadn't\nJefferson could has reneged on everything he could have died\nAt least according to Madison Hemings was on who later wrote on this I mean after talking with his mother Sally and James sort of extracted promises from Jefferson that they would be treated differently when I go back\nWas Sally certainly did that was the condition Madison Hemings said that that was a condition on which his mother came back\nShe would be treated well and\nHer children would be free and so they come back to mounted shallow\nThe sons are put under the ... edge of\nOne of her brothers John ... who was a master carpenter at Monticello and how many children did she have she had seven children but only for them live to adulthood which was sort of a thing that happened and we know Thomas Jefferson was the father of all we know the father of all of them and that's what Madison Hemings says and Israel Gillette Jefferson says\nAnd then the DNA it's corroborating it's not a strict paternity test but when you look at anything it's a compilation of evidence is not any one killer thing\nWhat do people say about Sally Hemings how do people describe her\nWell they didn't say much most of the descriptions of her a physical descriptions people describe her as being very beautiful that was the thing that people fixated on one newspaper report when the scandal broke described her as someone said that she was industrious and orderly\nNow when you when you said the scandal broke so Jefferson ... political enemies effort like this and that probably may have liquid judge Jefferson has the scandal on family mhm\nIt caused a real story is sort of spread everywhere it didn't really affect Jefferson's career I mean in the sense that he was reelected resoundingly\nAnd maybe some people reacted that way 'cause it actually was not that uncommon no no no she has certainly people in the south understood that this kind of thing happened\nAnd Jefferson had a reputation however of disorder philosopher you know the stereotypes that people have well if you really intellectual you know you're not interested in in ... in sex I mean which is\nRidiculous but he did to treat people were not proves people had sex and they had a different attitude about sex the Victorian age comes later these people were not Victorians but I think realistically people thought this is the south this is what happens when men are in control of women\n[noise] so how would you describe this relationship between [laughter] question is what were we use I mean you mentioned that yeah yeah their son Madison Hemings referred to his mother as Jefferson's cock you buy the word mistress has been used to describe or is there that are appropriate word here\nWell the word cocky about actually went back and looked at legal cases white women refer were referred to as concubine concubine was a person who lived with a man without being married period that's what it was and there are some cases when the men married the women so you can go from ... to being wife\nUm and we should point out the Jefferson's wife had died Oh yes there was like ... or any of this half\nYeah Jefferson's wife died and Seventeen eighty two and the Hemings women tell a story that when she was on her deathbed she asked Jefferson not to remarry the Hemings women said that she said she did not want another woman over her children\nThey said Jefferson agreed to that ... so she died he was thirty nine years old and he died when he was eighty three he never remarried that's a long time\nAnd apparently I mean this relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings went on for a long time for years and years\nIf the span of her childbearing is basically Twenty years so you can only say that the definite time period where you know for a fact they're having sex but\nShe was his chamber maids until he died so he arranged their lives so that she was in it all the time basically for Thirty years\nThe Hemings family oral history talks about how he felt about her one of Madison's granddaughters said Mr Jefferson love her dearly but he hasn't talked about how she felt about him\n'cause I mean that is the question a lot of people asked did they get all the time and there's no real reason that the answer to that and I mean is that even\nIf it had a legitimate question to ask if we're talking about a master's slave relationship\nWell a lot of people think it's not an appropriate question to ask because it's not possible for that to be but I don't subscribe to that because human beings do all kinds of things that they shouldn't do\nYou know I might say I can list all the reasons why you shouldn't feel that way but that doesn't have anything to do with the way human beings live in the world I think that's largely a political judgment is sort of after the fact political judgment that how uncomfortable we are with this idea\nMadison Hemings talks about them and the recollections he clearly is talking about them as if they are a family\nAnd that's kind of ... ... in a way\nSally and her children were treated very differently than the other slaves on Jefferson's plantation\nYes Madison Hemings says that they were happy growing up because they knew they were not going to be slaves all their lives\nWould eventually happen to the children the children who did survive into adulthood of Sally and Tom well\nBeverly Beverly as a male and his sister Harriet those are the two oldest children they left Monticello to live as white people they don't have freedom papers and\nYou can see why they don't want them because\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black because they'd been in slave and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail ... we know about Madison that asked and and that's the thing about documents that the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson this\nRevered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality who's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean what what\nDo we do well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery and we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work\nFor no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape\nThrough connections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nThat's really what this project is about\nAbout not seeing race as something that pits you against me but something that tells a story\nAnd it gives us an opportunity that we have not had before it has the ourselves is just deeply connected at the most fundamental level\nAnd I think many if not most white Americans grow up believing their ancestry is a hundred percent European in your experience how frequently to students discovered that they are multi racial\nWe've been doing statistical analysis\nAnd the group that is most likely to over estimate their background or whites whites will generally say I have a hundred percent European and often they will be predominantly European but there are other things in their background and even if somebody has two three four or five percent\nThey're completely flabbergasted\nOne gentleman who was really interesting a white guy said that there had been a story and his family that his great grandmother was black\nAnd that she had given away his grandfather so that he would have a better life he was biracial\nAnd that he had seen her only once in life and it was under obese clandestine circumstances and indeed we tested him and he had three percent African ancestry which would be consistent with that but for the most part\nPeople have these percentages and there isn't a narrative and it's not surprising because look at the history\nIn particular the United states where one drop of blood and so if somebody was light they quote path they lied about it\nSo does this open the door to interesting conversations when the kids go back home Oh yes\nSometimes stories tumble out that they hadn't expected\nWhen general and took the test it was a really funny many people will say they have Native American and their background which whites and blacks over estimate the Native American and their their background which is interesting because they had these romantic images of Native Americans and think about the real story of how Native Americans were treated\nBut at any rate there was a gentleman who said he had Native American and his background the evidence is always a woman with long dark braid so anyway we tested me comes up as ten percent African so he goes back to his family and I said God Bless them as families that are maybe she was black [laughter]\nBut I can imagine that this might play out in a class like maybe a kid who has identified as a hundred percent white European discovers that she's got\nSome African ancestry maybe it's an uncomfortable kind of situation for her I can imagine a kids sitting next or who's African American\nMight be really offended and say what you're not happy to have African blood or you racist\nYeah and I certainly understand why somebody who identifies as white is going to find it upsetting if they find African and their background for heaven's sake look at African Americans have been treated in this country legally and socially\nTo delve into that that's a real learning experience\nWhat are their beliefs might there have been somebody in their background who hid that for particular reasons and you know how do we move forward with that so it happens and and I'm not just with African ancestry Middle Eastern one fellow in in a class at two or three percent middle Easterners family it was up in arms about it\n[noise] so what kind of conversations do you have in classrooms after the students get their results and what are they wind up talking about with each other because the revelation\nIs just the beginning\nThe interesting thing is that over time people start to talk about race differently\nYou see a younger generation already being more flexible on again in our research we found that older people were more rigid about their backgrounds and black and white whatever younger people were much more fluid in terms of how they saw race and how they saw their racial identity\nAnd so we see these genetic tests as really just another element of making race\nMore fluid and allowing people to live with more ambiguity around race\nYounger people for a variety of reasons and these genetic tests are just part of it are much more comfortable with ambiguity with contested race and with having this conversation\nHave you noticed the young people are\nTo discover that they're multi racial\nYes much more so we'll have young people tested and often say I thought I was going to have more stuff than that you know they'll be disappointed that they don't have something and we even did one project with children who were uh I think the youngest was nine years old\nOne of the questions was what would you like to have in your ancestry what would be the best background and he said I Want everything\n[laughter] do you ever wonder what would happen if everybody just grew up knowing their genetic ancestry like what if genetic testing was mandatory\nIn first grade with that change about how we think and talk about race in this country I Do think that we're going to\nGet to a different place than talking about race now given some of the things that are going on socially and politically people say to me how can you say that\nBut I think that some of the turmoil that we're experiencing right now is because things are changing and it's really hard for people I think there's a point of panic before\nYou break through to another level and I think that there are enough good people who want to talk about these things who want to figure out how we can live together I don't think we have to give up\nOur understanding of real histories that have occurred in the United states and globally but I think that becomes part of the narrative that is not just\nThe African American narrative or the you know Italian it's it's our narrative it belongs to all of us so that when we look at our genes we realize that people are our people [noise]\nUm\nMm

I'm going to get bigger not\nErica how effective is that at\nThe effectiveness of any given ad is actually much harder to measure than you might think I'm but I Do think that this particular ad is raising some themes that are likely to resonate among the American public largely that that tax bill was unpopular and largely seen as benefiting the wealthy\nSays to the extent that that the ad can play into those themes and remind citizens what the Republican tax bill\nWho it disproportionately benefits I think can be a powerful message\nYou know another another seem that the president has latched onto and we're actually taking a look at this later in the show today\nIs immigration or the fear of immigration the sort of stoking fears of of Muslim Americans or Muslim immigrants um the caravan that's coming up how much has immigration played into any of these ads immigration\nIs not as prominent in advertising as you might expect in fact that was one of the big surprises to me when we were most recently looking at the data because you have a lot of polling suggesting that citizens are hearing a lot about integration and I think the place that they're hearing that is primarily in news media because\nThe focus on immigration in advertising is is quite small Republicans are certainly talking about it and they were splitting time between it is certainly in the summer but a relative to health care and tax it is it's it's not as prominent an issue\nThat's reviving the only mentions of immigration law that I've seen have been in a Republican ouch and it's usually brought up in the form of open borders and sanctuary cities mhm oh that's how it's being positioned\nWe've got about a minute left in the segment I'm just curious from both of you I Know the effectiveness is difficult to measure but do you think these other living effective or just annoying to a lot of folks\nThink citizens will universally tell you that they dislike negative advertising I think that's a constant throughout the modern campaign era I Do think you will for want to talk about how it works the issue is that you really want to break down what do you mean by work does advertising persuade does it get people to tune in our day\nAnd more likely to turn out and you have different answers for those different questions I Do think part of the reason we see so much negativity is it's it is one way to sort of grab attention and get citizens to tune in and listen to messaging\nYeah I agree with or go there I'm I'm not sure how much it works but my goodness there is certainly an awful lot of it going on out there and as we get closer and closer and closer who gets a\nMore and more blunt and the message I don't think of an era grandma you feel about this\nI've never seen the word lawyer\nCome up so much in Anchorage a as what I've seen this year the word used wind shoes lying there are aligned everybody's lawyering is so incredibly popular and you know there used to be kind of a thing in politics where you didn't use the L Word\nTo describe your opponent and clearly that no that's no longer operative ah it's clearly um a lot of negative ads that are out there are being refuted by people of referring to their opponent a as a liar\nAnd that will make citizens less likely to appreciate advertised and not that they really ever did I think there's a fair amount of political science evidence to suggest that negative advertising can be\nBeneficial from an informational perspective among the electorate but I Do think the negative personal attack their what they really don't like they see it as unfair and I think that is going to be at\nA decisive thing that people are a member from this cycle well we'll see\nHow it all turns out and just a couple of weeks Erika Franklin Fowler is associate professor of government at Wesleyan University where she directs the Wesleyan Media project in the past waiter is vice president and general manager of Kantar Media\nCampaign Media Analysis Group the mag ... both thanks [noise]\nOkay your turn argue being slammed with political ads\nHey my name is Nancy calling from South Florida we never thought I messed regular commercials for one candidate and the opposing which is on the ... each other\nGive us a call at eight seven seven eight my take more than a lead us to take away and don't worry about two weeks this will all be over at least until twenty twenty\nSupport for the takeaway comes from ... the European made language learning program battled teaches practical conversation in Spanish and French and German and other languages\nBut it will in the app store or online at ... dot com\nAnd as low dedicated to those who make build and do more offering mobile business banking with tools for freelancers and entrepreneur including ... and voicing mobile deposit an online account set to learn more at age the L.

GBH and Boston and she's here to give us an update on questions three high Gabriela Cather\nSo governor Charlie Baker first signed into law in this into law and twenty sixteen and we should mention that he's a Republican why is this even on the ballot today\n[noise] well the day he signed it into this repeal effort kind of was underway already so a group known as the Massachusetts family instituted their strive to promote Judeo Christian values here\nThey have been pushing to repeal this and they're big concern they say is safety of women and children and what their argument is is that the law that you mentioned the two thousand sixty ... is too broad and the way it defines gender identity\nIt doesn't require someone to be on hormone treatment or had gender reassignment surgery just needs to be sincerely held part of their identity and they say this is too broad and people can take advantage of it and their concerns that people will pretend to be transgender\nGo into women's bathrooms and pray on women and children never particularly concerned they say about convicted sex offenders and now one other thing is worth noting is that there isn't\nActually data to back up those arguments but that is the concern\nI mean that's the concern let's talk a little bit about what the law was meant to do how was the law meant to protect transgender folks in Massachusetts [noise] yeah\nSo what good is it inserted two words gender identity into the list of characteristics he can't discriminate someone based on so already there's race sex creed religion now among others gender identity and it says in all public accommodation so anyway the public goes think hotels restaurants hospitals taxis\nBut also public bathrooms in locker rooms\nSo essentially this is the bathroom debate that's no extended itself to Massachusetts in many ways\nIn many ways although it comes from a non discrimination law so it's a positive protection versus not letting them go into that\nI'm Wondering what the opponents of this law are doing or their as their advertising around this are they doing outreach to how are they trying to you know really influenced voters\nTheir main strategy as I've talked to them has been advertisements on line I'm On the radio and the production is on TV soon\nAnd what's the response been from transgender activists and a civil rights organizations\n[noise] yeah they say that what's at stake here it's kind of the basic respect and dignity of fellow Massachusetts and ... they had been very active canvassing across the state\nAnd I've spoken to somebody who actually have left their business a canvas fulltime and work on this campaign and that was at a transgender woman and she actually said that if this repeal does happen she'll look to move to another state she's looking to New Hampshire where there are protections\nAnd what are the poll say about question three is there enough support to keep these protections in place as we head into a the election\n[noise] yeah so the most recent poll I'm from the Boston Globe UMass Lowell found a Seventy four percent favors keeping this law that is up from polls over the summer that found it closer to fifty percent were in support of it\nThe concern from the campaign trying to keep it is that there will be a last minute kind of blitz of lots of TV ads preying on people's fears\nSo is there still bipartisan support or has become politicized given the current climate\nSo it's up to the voters and it looks like there's support on both sides as you said a Republican governor signed into law one interesting thing this whole found is that the voters may not fully understand a lot when you ask do you want to keep the law they say yes but when they say are you okay with transgender individuals going to the bathroom they're less likely to say\nWe'll be paying attention Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for W.
