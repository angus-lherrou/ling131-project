over is the sound studies scholar\nShe teaches at Binghamton University and she grew up in Southern California\nOf the most diverse regions in America\nShe was an early hip hop fan\nIt was when she was going out to concerts um clubs that she first started noticing what she calls the sonic collar on line\nThis was about I Would say two thousand seven maybe two thousand six and it was at\nThe moment when LA's downtown was changing from the site where brown and poor people live in the city to its current kind of gentrified state so all of these old factories and empty office buildings are being transformed into loft and condominiums\nAnd folks on Skid Row were being pushed out I had gone to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl I'd actually gone to see Isaac Hayes at the Hollywood Bowl as often happens in LA I got stranded downtown in the middle of the night waiting for the bus\nAnd what I heard coming from the doorways at two in the morning with classical music really high volume classical music\nThat I was standing there by myself going what what is happening here\nAnd then I realized that music was being played to keep people from sleeping in the doorway\nTo kind of like a hostile architecture right found being used as a\nQuote unquote classical music I Can't possibly be noise no matter how loud you have it\nThe glass ceiling of people in the building\nWhile really being just kind of hostile to bounce down\nBut it's just basically sonic gentrification\nAffluent white people have moved in and feel like well now we get to decide what's he always what it\nAlso just the idea that when you buy into a place where you move into a neighborhood the neighborhood has to conform to your ideas about what a neighborhood sounds like\nRather than an adjustment to the sounds that are around you\nDo what's an example of say a public debate around noise that you think actually it was a racial debate\nAnother example of racial politics operating through sound occurred in New York City in Harlem\nAnd it involved a drum circle taking place outside Marcus Garvey park on Sunday afternoon [noise]\n\nDrum circle had been there since the late sixties and came out of the black power movement and black arts movement and in two thousand sat in a condo building that had sold and been refurbished rents raise and white middle class people moving into a neighborhood that has historically been\nBlack and Puerto Rican there began to be increasing noise complaints by the residents to their condo board into the police this sound became something that the white condor residents really fixated on now is actually probably occurring in many forms in cities across the country [noise]\nStarted thinking you know the history of big cities like New York is in a lot of ways a history of displacement as population shift and\nMove from one neighborhood to another sounds like you could almost right the history of cities and found\nOh absolutely it's one of the things that I studied quite intensely I've actually looked at New York in the forties when there was another moment of upheaval after the war when Puerto Ricans we're moving from Puerto Rico to the states\nAnd you find in the newspapers at the time like the New York times letters\nAnd white people talking about their Puerto Rican neighbors but saying things like the city has become an audio slum wow and I said he a sound artist named Tony Schwartz who in the Nineteen forties lived in hell's kitchen right near where Lincoln Center was about to be developed\nSo he lives through the displacement and the destruction of San Juan hill which was largely black and Latino neighborhood that was raised completely to make Lincoln Center\nThey combine the watchers dancing on on the streets and I think it's terrible you described you or do you know they do the same to me they do it and then I\nHe has recordings from that era of that neighborhood and actually made the argument can a radio show that here we are destroying thousands of musical performances taking place every night\nTo create a space for one very elite performance happening every night who has the power to control the kind of sounds that are made in the city and also who have to live with the noise of all of this construction being built\nWow whether it's the Lincoln Center or the cross Bronx expressway certain sounds very loud sound that are supposed to be able to tolerate because there's sold it'd be good for everybody when they're serving only a certain population [noise]\nSome prejudice but I Wonder if there are ways in which communities of color or disenfranchised neighborhoods\nAlso you sound to define and carve out a space I guess I was thinking\nThat isn't that part of the story of the rise of hip hop in the Bronx in the seventies very much so\nI've also research Harlem and the Nineteen forties and the way that black and brown people black people in Puerto Ricans\nHad conversations about noise in the newspaper in conversations about how do we share space\nEverybody celebrates sometimes\nIt's not that certain people are noise makers and certain people aren't and you'll see from that period the Amsterdam news urging black readers to be more tolerant say of Spanish accents in their community\nThat hey when we moved up from the south and we were discriminated against for our southern speech so we don't want to think of Spanish as something that doesn't belong or is noisy and hip hop is another place where ... black and Puerto Rican people together [noise]\nYeah yeah yeah\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nWhat are you singing or you sort of remembering what the person has told you about this particular ... no no no no I don't\nUsually I'm just making ... actually\n\nI've always been a singer who likes to improvise and he likes to kind of explode different sounds trying to sound maybe like sounds of nature machines or city or\nThose kinds of things so that's quite an interesting challenge\nWhat do you want from these walks particularly those first walks when you're walking with someone else on a walk that matters to them what you call a special walk [noise] why do

of place and memory people's memories of that\nThey're very much memory works really I I often I only have to say\nWhat is special about this war for you why did you choose it\nAnd that's it you know

I like so much that idea that let's just stone doesn't listen to annoy the construction site [noise]\nSounds all equally important so sound is better than another or more important than another gave all equal value [noise]\nSo many layers of different kind of sound politic beeping high sounds and this may be a few rows slightly different pitch they begin to sound like an orchestra traits that still to find so [noise]\nAs soon as you start listening to a sound instead of trying to look it out or deciding you hated it becomes more interesting [noise]\nPlaying around like chosen [noise]\nChildren really kind of like sound they liked making sounds and they took it as much as I should get older mostly what happens is you get quieter yourself you kind of don't like those sounds\nAnd so I think that if you enjoy going to sound can go [noise]\nIt sounds like what you're really talking about is discovery\nYou're sort of realizing oh there's all this kind of\nFascinating stuff out there if we just listen to it normally we just don't pay attention\nI think if we're actually in shallow it's\nYes it's much more interesting to discover them I think it makes you feel more of pollen and mold non judgmental in general\nAnd I just think that that is true that the cruise attitude to promote\nIn general in this world and this time we live in\nMovie in ... is a singer and sound artist she's recorded shadow walk all over the world and she was talking with St Paul so\nThanks also to David Rothenberg ... sharing all of his ... with us [noise]\nCheck out his podcast newfound walk city there's a link on our website\nAlso while you're there don't forget to check out our interactive map of all the south was hurt in today's show\nAT T T E book dot org slash sonic map [noise]\nPlease have your own sound to [noise]\nTo the best of our knowledge come see from Madison, Wisconsin where I'm game days you can hear the U.

alcohol I tend to Vegas and this is the takeaway also on the show when families pay for college do they have to\nMore and more parents should feel comfortable saying look we're not going to take on

Christina do we have a sense of who is consuming the most alcohol in the United states particularly when it comes to heavy drinking [noise]\nYes unsurprisingly as those under age twenty five\nIn the United states so college aged populations um those in college but also you know non college attending young adults drink the most although writes don't decline that much and we see a lot of people in the age range of forty five to sixty five there are a lot of\nAlcohol consumers although probably only about Fifteen to twenty percent of those in about forty five to sixty five year old age range are binge drinkers are heavy episodic drinkers with any sort of frequency and the heavy and binge drinking we often see in college age population\nGabrielle I'm Wondering this was something that we were thinking about in terms of culture in American culture we know as we all just said here are college students have a proclivity for for binge drinking frat parties on college campuses what role does gender play and all of this we know today on\nCollege campuses the numbers of men and women are roughly equal in terms of actual numbers physical numbers but activities remained defined by mail\nPleasure fraternity parties football\nGames tailgate parties pre gaming drinking to get drunk has become something that drinking researchers have studied since the Nineteen eighties there are surveys that started taking place in the early Nineteen eighties and they've they've lasted for about Twenty years I think up to two thousand two\nCollege students were actually reporting oh I'm drinking on an empty stomach and more women were doing this and men I'm drinking shots I'm doing this intentionally\nI Want to get drunk this is my object it's not to socialize and have a good time and just hang out and have a couple of drinks with my friends it's literally the object is to to get\nObliterated curious Christian also if you saw the hearing a and you saw the exchanges between a Brett Kavanaugh and the senators who were questioning him when this issue came up what was your reaction to ... sort of defense of his drinking or defense of the questioning\nYeah so we know that people with more sort of\nSocioeconomic and other resources are sort of April to\nExperience higher levels of binge drinking and experienced fewer consequences and sort of see more of the positive attributes of drinking\nAnd so you know quite frankly it didn't surprise me that this is how he portrayed on his drinking experience as many Americans so many people look back fondly on their college years and their high school years of heavy binge drinking heavy episodic drinking\nWithout sort of realizing that there are you know hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not so lucky and cannot sort of drink at those levels and continue you know they end up developing either alcohol use disorder or experience you know legal social consequences that are really important so\nBoth from my own my own experience you know as someone who went to high school and college as well as what I've seen from the research\nIt didn't surprise me that someone with having a social stature sort of seized drinking and understand drinking and the way that he does\nYeah and I I think about President Trump recently\nYou know ... drove the point home that he does not drink at all and\nUh there are reasons why the president doesn't drink he's had a alcoholism in his own family what about the thirty some odd percent of Americans who don't drink Christina I'm curious what do you do if you're one of those people who doesn't want to drink doesn't choose to drink or you disconnected from the social\nContract from the social fabric if you don't I found it quite difficult if\nYou know not drinking and then trying to I'm engaged socially\nYou know that's not an area of research that I studied myself but from what I've observed\nOn and talking to people who are non drinkers opposite lately you know for example even thinking about your work places that I've been a part of and the pass happy hour going out for drinks with friends afterwards is also a place where\nSort of business deals are done or work gets done as well as an important I'm sort of form of socialization and then I think that some non drinkers are quite comfortable\nAround people who are consuming alcohol but it's very difficult for some people on particularly those who have potentially had an alcohol use disorder and their own past\nThe contacts and being in environments like a bar environment can be a a a difficult thing to do so I think there's a lot of\nYou know in American culture a lot of us is built around you know drinking environments and drinking expectations and one thing we do know is that when you drink and you go out to these contacts you know if you're drinking in a bar with friends\nYou tend to really drink the level of those around you so we know even sort of amongst drinkers that there is a sort of social contagion this affects that if I typically have one drink but I'm going out to happy hour with colleagues and we you know my friends are my coworkers are consuming two to three drinks\nI probably will drink more than I Would otherwise so I think that you know non drinkers also feel that social contagion that sort of influence of drinking and I imagine that's quite difficult\nTo do we have a problem Gabrielle oh I Believe we do eighty eight thousand people\nUm according to the CDC die every year from alcohol overuse cirrhosis steps between two thousand and two thousand Fifteen after having declined for three decades straight rose Twenty one percent and men aged forty five and sixty four\nAnd alarmingly fifty seven percent among women wow Christina do we have a problem\nAbsolutely I think that um you know he's got deaths and that they're more alcohol attributable deaths than a related to any other substance and that's one of sort of the leading causes of preventable death I'm In this country\nAnd you know beyond just looking at mortality the morbidity the impact on our society is just massive\nEverything from you know physiological problems feeling hung over not being able to go to work the next day to social consequences feelings shame getting in trouble in the workplace legal problems\nAs well as of course of ... and the media today we're talking about you know sexual assault sexual violence there intimate partner violence with some of my research focuses on the link between TV and alcohol so\nI think if we take sort of take a broader look at the impacts of alcohol in the United states and worldwide it's sort of you know it's\nThere is no way you could say that we do not have a problem with alcohol\nAnd from each of you any thoughts on how we can get better\nI think we need to look at countries in which and cultures in which moderation is really modeled very very well we don't have a culture of moderation in this country for anything pristine\n[noise] so a lot of my research focuses on sort of but I called environmental prevention so I was thinking about how we can actually change the context in which we drink and these are you know the social context as well as some some physical aspects of the places where people drink so I think\nUm if we think about prevention and as well as secondary prevention so prevention of heavy drinking and the first place as well as sort of preventing these consequences related to alcohol\nSo we don't sort of put all the pressure just on the individual that you know you're responsible for your own drinking and you need to go seek treatment that help if you have a problem with drinking I think that we can sort of think of it in a broader contacts and try to think what we can do\nAs a culture and as a country to prevent these problems and the first place and I think they are a number of avenues that we could potentially explore to help reduce alcohol problems that a population level\nGabrielle Glazer is the author of her best kept secret why women drink and how they can regain control\nAnd Christina mayor is the assistant professor of behavior and
