S. D. A. and the FDA\nNineteen Seventy seven the first dietary goals for Americans said eat less fat\nWell if you eat less fat the food tastes like cardboard the food industry knew that so what they do they pumped into sugar and now I've heard this corn syrup was cheaper so they could do it ... miles let me give you an example of how this works ... my favorite product of all time lucky charms\nYeah they're magically delicious and they are right why they're marshmallows in the box cutter delicious secondary by other marshmallows in the box\n'cause they're fun to eat 'cause marshmallows or sheep and goats are expensive to take up more room in the box and they can sell them for more wow great business strategy [noise]\nSo everyone says education educate the public to get published tell them what's going on except for one thing education has it worked for any other substance abuse\nThat Nancy Reagan was just saying no work\nSo what does that leave us\nEveryone says wait a second don't tell me what to eat well you know what you've already been told what to eat\nWhere were you for the last forty years as your food supply was being changed under your nose where you're protesting then everyone says get\nOut of my kitchen you know one of my kitchen either unless there's somebody more dangerous already there\nOkay so the real question is who the hell do you want in your kitchen the government who will take your freedom and your wallet or the food industry who was already ticking your freedom your wallet and your health\nThat's your only choice [noise]\nUm [noise]\nSome given that choice what are we do ultimately we have to figure out how the food industry can still make money selling real food and the answers can absolutely they can\nBut not with the current business model the food industry grosses one trillion dollars a year in the United states\nOf that four hundred and fifty billion of it is gross profit now health care costs in America total to point seven trillion dollars a year of which Seventy five percent\nIs chronic metabolic disease of which Seventy five percent of that could be preventable if we would do something about our diet\nThat's one point four trillion dollars\nTriple what the food industry makes we spend triple cleaning up the food industry is mess than they actually make the bottom line is they're going to drive this bus till the wheels fall off the only answer\nIs real food we just have to figure out how to make it available and profitable for every one\nAt a late I'm assuming the sugar industry\nBut really hate you sure yeah I intend words or less yeah they they they love me yeah that's the way this works my job is to provide the science so that the public can make its own informed decision and\nThen but not many people are saying what you're saying I mean\nYou know look there's a lot of noise in the system for obvious reasons you've got all of these this ... of people with their own vested interests I have no vested interests other than taking care of children and seeing\nChildren get to adulthood to have a decent chance in life that's my vested interests and to be honest with you it ought to be everybody's vested interest [noise]\nSo are you just like totally anti sugar or do you like do you in college\nYeah just to sell a little bit of course now and again the problem is\nI'm for dessert yeah\nFor dessert right but if you're going to have breakfast cereal\nWith orange juice and take a priest son and\nA granola bar and that's all before three o'clock\nYou know then you've got a problem\n\nEver less take is a professor at the University of California in San Francisco you can see his entire talk at Ted got NPR\nWere back in just a minute stay with us on the show today ideas about how we connect to food I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from NPR\nAcross the country colleges are beginning to offer students nor can in case they need to reverse an opioid overdose\nWe felt that he was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic affects everybody\nOthers question if it could encourage drug use that story plus the fallout from Jamal 'cause she'll she's death this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News today\nPort on eighty nine nine W.

that ah most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ...\nThe to the smoky are actually being dictated by our nostrils but operations wonderful job of ... and the information I get from my nose and making me believe it's coming from I ... this is Charles Spence a head of the ... research ... ... ... for the university\nDo not even ... even if we don't want to eat insects\nYou even if you don't want to eat insects I'll give you an example halfway tomato ketchup\nNow and then that will be one tomato that has a warming it's and\nWell not all of those will be politics and so a part of them will end up in the country of\nMyself as chocolate peanut butter and noodles free any much\nProcessed food has a small dose of insects and in the not too distant future he says that we all might need to eat bugs\nHave necessity myself ... planes why on the stage\nHuman population is growing very rapidly it will grow to about nine billion in two thousand fifty how are we going to feed this world\nWe have a third more mouths to feed but we need agricultural production increase of Seventy percent that's especially because this world population is increasing not only in numbers of rules for getting wealthier\nAnd anyone who gets wealthier starts with more means immediate effect is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production\nBecause at the moment Seventy percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock is not only the lens where the lifestyle is walking a feeding but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported we can increase it a bit\nAt the expense of rain forest but there's a limitation very soon\nUnless you remember that we need to increase agriculture production but Seventy percent we're not going to make it that way\nBecause much better change from means to insects [noise]\n\nEasy in fact not only is a good alternative to meet but as the future of food\nA sort of the nation\nAnd insects are an excellent they'll turn of it\nBecause they need much less a land than producing regular life stalk and lifestyle is so inefficient because for one kilogram of beef that you will get on your plate\nYou need about twenty five kilograms of feed insects are doing a much better job or you need only about two points to get a runs a feed for one kilogram of crickets and meets so if we are going to be forced to produce food in a more efficient way\nSwitching from regular meat allies talk to insects is a very logical thing to do\nThat as a big if of course out of this if insects produce meets that is a good quality what I've been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein offense offered them and it's very good in fact it's comparable to anything that we eat as meat at the moment\nAnd even in terms of calories is burned with lung cancer in ... has the same amount of calories is ten dogs are six big Macs [noise]\nSo we have to get used to the idea of eating insects as some might think well they're not yet available\nWell they are\nThere and for nursing and that ... that produce them maybe by two thousand twenty Joe Biden just knowing that this is an insect as your groceries\nSo why not eat insects you should try it yourself a talk of years ago we had Seventeen hundred and fifty people's altogether on a square in my town and they ate insects at the same moments and these were still big\nBig news I think soon it will not be big news any more than we only been six because it's just a normal way of doing [noise]\nProfession that I see one\nPretty significant problem with all the what's the problem that you see it's gross thanked disgusting how could you eat an insect\nUh yeah that's that's the thing that comes to mind most often and um if you really think it's very serious and you look as an insect you take a\nLocus or crickets and you take away their wings and the the legs\nThen you put that next to 'em an ice shrimp if you look at them they're they're basically to sing\nAnd even from a biological point of view they're very close relatives and so if you love to eat shrimp then why would you not love to eat um locus which in some countries you learn all the the the sky shrimp\nI mean I still want to make this work in my life and in the lives of the people are saying but uh but I Can't even I Try to be mindful and imagining biting into a look at and it's just I Can't get there\nWell then for you at this stage it might be an alternative to eat\nPasta and which the crickets having grants and under the distributors into the pasta and so he want to hear anything you know it's a ... with cricket meal\nI understand that it takes a while to sort of get over this that's when the first sushi wasn't being on the markets are in the United states eating raw fish was not something\nWell accepted you know\nYou can eat sushi anywhere\nYeah so there's all kinds of foods that maybe initially might not have the all these rights but still make it\nSo if if actually you know let's say we can get over this sort of cultural a version and the last two or eating lots of insects and let's say we just ate so many insects that really reduced our consumption of chicken\nAnd beef and pork and you know lamb what would happen\nI think we would ... would be able to stream everyone were proteins and ... we will do the best news ... part of its brand new ... and with this or ... years since\nOur dinner table would be much more than ... um I think you shouldn't smoke of it as a real overcome this gross furniture\nAnd know how can we make in

far manuals town I Am disabled which make getting into the voting place sometimes a little bit difficult\nWhy is it so hard to vote in this country we're going to break that down all this week on the take away I tend to eat a Vega also on the show the racial breakdown on who benefits from the tax bill and the tax code overall\nForty three percent of all the benefits that come through this ...\nWhite people in the top ... percent income\nAnd in the wake of ... murder a look at the Twitter troll farm in Saudi Arabia when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing what they go Twitter they really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them perceive their own government to take away we'll be right back after these headlines [noise]\nThe ... second is um [noise] uh the all the technology that comes around\nCasting and counting the ballot so about eighty percent of people in the United states can cast ballots on paper those paper ballots are often fed into um large tabulate there's a that might look like large copy machines for instance that feed these documents and read all of the ballot markings on them so they can count them\nOr some people still vote on touch screen machines a and there's technology inside of those that allows those ballots to be counted as well\nSo that's the second big area of technology and then the last theory of technology is once the polls close on election day everyone pretty much expects election results to be delivered out immediately and as a courtesy a election administrators try to get those results out on official though they may be as quickly as they can to voters and to the media\nAnd that system that election results system is another area of technology that's used in the in the entire election process\nAnd talking about election infrastructure with David Becker and that's basically everything from how you registered how you cast your ballot to how it gets counted David we hear a lot about the the voter rolls and you talked about maintenance of those lists who is in charge of maintaining these less because we are hearing a lot about people including here in New York City where some voters got\nLetter saying that they were taken off list or they weren't eligible to vote\nHow does that happen why is there's so much confusion at that stage\nThe state usually takes responsibility all of the county to play a very large role in that and one of the real challenges is\nUm and I've done research in the ... for for many many years is that Americans are highly mobile they move between elections and election officials don't get very good information on that\nAnd I think most election officials would agree we want all of the eligible people to vote in on the on the west but we also want to make sure that if someone has moved out of New York for instance or moved out of your state that they can be easily removed from the list and there are federal laws that govern that as well\nSo getting really good information on when someone has moved or when someone has died and making sure you get it right can be very very challenging and I'm there as I said federal laws that govern this um and there is an additional a um a a tool that election officials can use in some states New York doesn't put twenty four other states do\nIt's called the electronic registration Information Center Eric for shorten I led the effort to create that and it allows election officials to get much better information much higher quality information on one of voter might have moved out of their states\nWithin their state or died since the last election\nYou know I'm Wondering also I'm David why don't we have a system that I Know we've heard about this a lot of folks will talk about this but why don't isn't there a system where folks are automatically registered to vote when they turn Eighteen\nSo there are or what we lack in the United states and what many other countries have is a some kind of official registry of citizens we don't have one magic list in the United states where all citizens are on there with it up to date information they're giving the point in\nTime so I'm often the best data base in the state of who might be eligible to vote is the motor vehicles database\nBut that's in complete sometimes it's not up to date but it is the best one in many states um have been moving towards taking the information that citizens provide them at motor vehicles and automatically or\nTransferring that information into the voter lists and um that can be a very very effective tool to not only get new voters under the list but even more importantly keeping those that are already on the list with up to date information so election officials not to contact them\nIn twenty Seventeen just before leaving office the ah the former department of homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson designated this election infrastructure as critical infrastructure and I'm Wondering if this infrastructure is so critical why does it seem to be broken in some areas\nSo I don't know that I'd say it's broken I actually think we were in better shape than we've ever been a\nManhattan why do you say that David because they think then that the competing narrative too often what we see in the news\nWell there are a lot of folks in the news where portraying a narrative that things are more vulnerable than ever and that nobody's doing anything about it and um I can tell you I've been worked on this issue for a long time\nThere's been more work done to secure the election infrastructure in the last two years than we've ever seen before and the twenty Eighteen election will be more secure than any election we've ever held even though there are real threats from foreign adversaries\nElection officials are now sharing information better than ever before not just between the states but also down to the county level and all the way up to the federal government and potential threats\nThere are more tools in place to monitor potential interference or at a ... an election officers than ever before near the nearly Ninety per se actually over Ninety percent of all voters living jurisdictions the now have highly sophisticated sensors monitoring activity coming in and out of the system\nUm this was not where we were in twenty sixteen and it reflects the tremendous improvements that have been made by election officials it's not as sexy a story to talk about the hard work that election officials and da da da da da dum but it's the real story that voters should know that when they go to vote\nIn November of twenty Eighteen that their votes are going to count be counted as they cast well\nHow do we know I mean I'm I'm less interested in if it's a sexy story as opposed to if it's one that um that that's true here like it because we are continuing to hear this and we're seeing like\nA long lines in Georgia for example this idea that the letters that have been sent out to New York or voters and those things I think tell us that or at least give the impression to Americans that their vote is you know may or may not be counted or they may run into\nSome difficulties at the polls particularly if we're talking about poor people and communities of color David\nSo I'd make several points about that first of all the letters that go out ah about voter list maintenance and about the possibility that you might have moved are required under federal law\nAnd the reason that they send those letters out is to tell people we might be removing you from the list but even if you get a letter like that\nYou're not being removed from the list for another two federal election cycles you go into an active status and that means if you show up at the polls to vote you will be given a regular ballot and your voter registration will be activated again suit you that you won't fall into an active status again in\nThe case of long lines and places like Georgia we have to remember this is early voting these are people who are opting to vote in an area where they've afforded them the opportunity to vote early which is really good more voters have the opportunity to vote early than ever before in the United states\nAnd um and so the lines are long comeback another time it's much better than ... finding a long line in a place like New York where you can effectively only vote on election day most places all out for early voting now\nHow much is the the voter infrastructure the election infrastructure really insulated from the politics of who's in office right is it is it something that's at risk of being politicized I think I and I asked that question because of what we're seeing right now playing out in Georgia\nWith camp for example who's yet so there are one foot in both of the of the sides here\nSo there are um there are instances where\nThings are not working out as they should be in Georgia could be one of those places but um I'd also point out it is not unusual for secretaries of state to be on the ballot when they're also running the election that nearly twenty states have that going on right now\nI'm In most of those states there is no problem with it at all the\nCandidate and can separate the campaign\nFrom the secretary of state running the election and that can make that can that's something we're seeing whether they're Republicans or Democrats so I think what we're seeing in places like Georgia might be are are are outliers um compared to what most voters are experiencing which is the easiest process that they've ever had before and\nDavid Becker is the executive director and founder of the center for election innovation and research David thank you for being with us\nSupport for the

so forty three percent of all the benefits that come through the tax code are captured by white people in the top five percent of income earners\nAnd why says some people might say well what about wealthy black Americans or what about well the people of color\nWhile the people of color do do pretty good but they still don't do as well as very wealthy white people\nSo for example wealthy black through the tax code make about twenty thousand dollars per year where wealthy whites make almost fifty two thousand dollars per year through the tax code so even very wealthy blacks and Hispanics and Asians do far worse than wealthy whites and Mr ...\nAnd let's talk about tax cuts I mean you guys had some data here that showed that again the wealthiest households white households receive more in tax cuts than black and Latino households what is that about\n... our tax code largely rewards wealth that it was already created so people the put money in investments and are able to get their income through capital gains people that are able to pass through income through corporations similar to what was\nHighlighted in New York Times is the way Donald Trump's father handle a lot of his tax liability these\nPeople that are able to do that do a lot better in the tax code people that earn income through wages are taxed at a higher rate than people that are able to earner income through investment so even on the high end LeBron James for example\nShe earned that money largely the income from the Los Angeles Lakers and that would be taxed at a thirty seven percent rate where Warren Buffett makes a lot of his money through investments and that's tax with a much lower rate of twenty percent\nSo what did you see here is a situation where there's bias and how you earn your income and people of color tender earner income through wages therefore tax at a higher rate\nHow much does this have to do I mean we know I guess one of the underlying factors here is the racial wealth gap in this country um and without getting too in the weeds there basically can you tell us how that's impacting what we're seeing here is that some of the baked in systemic issues that you were talking about\nYeah so actually what we have and you've covered it quite a bit on your show is wherever racial wealth gap that is expanding year by year decade by decade century ... century and has been going on and it was largely the product of public policy\nYou know it starts with land seizures from American Indians to African Americans be seen as property not even people and on into housing discrimination employment discrimination and then currently\nAll that manifest into how benefits are distributed\nThrough the tax code so would you have is a tax code that is super charging the racial wealth divide by exacerbating build inequalities by driving benefits that come from the federal government to the very rich and aren't going down to the very poor\nJeremy ... vice president of policy

versus Wisconsin state school superintendent and he's currently trailing Walker by just one point in the polls candidates met for their first debate on friday night\nLet's go back to what doesn't\nScott Walker's policies is yet to tell us how much is going to raise your taxes in general in summer from Madison does you're going to tell you after the election how much lookout [noise]\nAccording to polling by Marquette University education health care and infrastructure of the three most important issues to Wisconsin voters this November here to discuss the upcoming election and where the candidates stand on those issues is Shawn Johnson the Capitol bureau chief at Wisconsin Public radio Hi Sean\nSo let's start with education what Scott Walker's record on that and how does it compare to Tony reverse who has been the state superintendent since two thousand and night\nSo because Scott Walker's been governor for you know almost eight years now he was governor after the great recession in in his first term\nHe had some pretty dramatic cuts to K. twelve public education in Wisconsin and that's what you've heard about from Democrats in this this race probably predictably are those deep cuts to K. twelve education he's also cut the University of Wisconsin is you know the public university system here\nIn three of his for budgets so that's part of the governor's record but in his most recent budget the one that you know we're under now in Wisconsin Walker had a pretty dramatic increase in public school funding and his first increase in university funding\nSo that's what he's focusing on in this race he's put that up against Tony ... who as state superintendent of public instruction\nDoesn't get to set that budget but talks about what he wants to see in it and has to kind of administer it with the schools around the state\nEras is always called for some of these these bigger increases that the governor has just recently embraced\nYou know another thing that's important to Wisconsin voters this health care um we know that Scott Walker backed a lawsuit um aimed at repealing the Affordable CARE Act but at the same time fifty five percent of voters in Wisconsin say they want to keep the Affordable CARE Act so where do things stand there\nYeah and if you ask voters here what they think about protections for pre existing conditions the number ... way up that's extremely popular in Wisconsin as it is nationally uh where it stands is I mean that has definitely been an issue in the race between Walker and ...\n... has emphasized that lawsuit and walkers come back and said look if the Affordable CARE Act is ever overturned I Will call the legislature and special session will pass this state bill that would put similar preexisting conditions protections in state law\nSo they'll always be covered ah the thing is that state bill fall short of what the CIA would do um I mean it it does call for pre existing conditions protections but it would let insurance companies and pose a lifetime cap\nOn insurance so uh see for example like a cancer patient with expensive treatment could see their insurance kept\nAt a million dollars under the state bill that something that's not allowed into the federal Affordable Care act so it's not an apples to apples comparison but I think the fact that you see the governor engaging on that point and saying hey I have a different plan\nOr just deals to show you how much health care and particularly the pre existing conditions argument has come to the forefront in this campaign\nAnd try and we're talking about election infrastructure this week how we vote and and what that looks like a we're coming up on the end of the segment but I'm curious to tell if you give us a sense of what it looks like in Wisconsin voters expected to have a pretty smooth mid term elections\nYeah we know that Wisconsin was one state where a hackers tried to target us in the twenty sixteen election they were not successful and so I guess what you can say broadly as officials here are diligently watching this they're working on it but as far as we know there are no problems\nSo we'll see what happens
