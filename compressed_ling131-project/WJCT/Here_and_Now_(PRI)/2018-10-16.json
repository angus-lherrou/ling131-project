I mean look we have one photograph of Frederick Chopin\nOne photograph\nIn that picture he's a he's going\nWhat Frederick Chopin really look like what was his mind you know you look at a photograph of Chopin and you say oh this is what show Penn looked like well no Chopin looked\nLike many things even the very day that that photograph was taken he had\nThousands of different expressions on his face but then what about a year earlier or ten years earlier I mean knowing Chopin is a very complex thing it's not one thing to millions of different things that we are United by analogy [noise]\nInto something that we refer to as one thing [noise]\n[noise]\nWe should say we looked into it and there are actually two pictures that show [noise] many kinds of scaling and there you can't really tell him\nNo smiles\n[noise]\n...\nWill know me she'll be in you know\nAny ah any I Know\nLesson number two are you just talking or are you doing to product at ... ... ... what's that I said I Do know you try\nHello ... story from Greg Warner yes hijack Greg ... is a NPR's East Africa\nCorrespondent you are in what what time is it where you are it's um it's evening he's based in Nairobi round seven thirty in the name was ... I just told you good morning in so he um but I forgot to say good evening so oh okay\nSo great I mean we were just a [laughter] anyhow [laughter]\nWe call Greg ... because he had written this article for this great website called trance dot org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps you know when you have to go from one language to another\nBut there's actually a really good example that I didn't use in the piece about uh the failure to communicate I can tell you that story that you are yeah so so there's this word and you wouldn't think of it as a translator but it's the word serious and\nWhen you're ... you're in a serious like ... us okay I'm In my experience when you hear this word serious in East Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful are are stern it actually\nAlmost never has something to do with your mood for serious tends to me is are you just\nTalking to me or are you serious are you doing something and usually doing it's like some kind of transaction usually a financial I've been asked by you know many East African officials are you going to be serious with me and\nIt obviously means are you going to pay me a bribe oh usually I Pretend misunderstand that they came home and I said yes I'm a very serious international journalists and um but this story that I Want to tell you as\nGood afternoon everybody I'm\nI'm really pleased to be back in Africa Secretary Kerry ... visited Ethiopia and city of enormous energy and the country is a few\nDays before carry visit Ninety journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism of the government is illegal\nI had a series of very productive meeting this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and Secretary Kerry was given this press conference I shared my concerns about a\nYoung age the opium blogger that I met last year a ... like gay who ah with age of his peers I've been in prison\nAnd I firmly believe that the work of journalists weather as print journalists are in the Internet or media of other kinds it makes societies stronger\nYou know he said all the things that he's expecting to say said they believe that free speech and open dialogue and important to the economic development of country buffet blah but\nWe remain committed to our partnership with ...\nWith this comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise be up yet and\nI'd be delighted to answer your questions I'm not sure how that's going to do that\nThen came time for questions he took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists to more from the traveling press and to carry\nCredit or give us John I Want to give them a shot I Know he was very impatient sort of ... he was like you know what we're just going to try something different we are going to like\nCall on an Ethiopian journalist I Want to make sure we get a fairly distribution yeah here Carrie pointed this one guy in the second row young guy in the twenties boyish face wearing a moustache of\nOnly two questions flu said I may have invited artist question of the day that\nBut one question fair enough\nSo let me she was a ... of raised double ... or not the names of liquor\nWho's at Logan in these friends there are in much below this guy's like well every time a journalist is arrested us gives a statement about this by these things out of this keep happening every piece of repeating very much\nSo then he asked this question\nIs if ... seriously because of the double it's ... it's\nJust lip service or are you seriously concerned [noise]\nAt this point everybody is just not carry they're all looking at these journalists who obviously had to take considerable personal recipe in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state run TV station she's\nThis guy's on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arrest a journalist we really ... ... ...\nTeri looks at him like well [noise]\nYou've got to be kidding\nWhere I stand up and vote like and I and I say something um\nI I Try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious and when I raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he sort of insulted by the question and and you have to remember\nHere is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much in are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transaction right and so what this journalists is saying is you are you just ... London or are you doing something\nMay be threatening you will be a who is withdrawing eight or withdrawing support and Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously called for the release\nOf these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy\nThank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry\nOr this or this fellow oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards\nT versus shock there's less violence and\nThe right because it because you're looking at guys who may not exhibit the symptoms of shock necessarily but of overtime it becomes impossible for them to go on there's a wonderful film from World war two called let there'd be like\nThese are the casualties of his trouble than mine\nMen who are damaged emotionally\nAbout guys with what they were then calling battle fatigue and the reason they were calling it that was because you didn't necessarily see it right away\n[noise] been around Vietnamese as we realized you don't just see this on the battlefield you see it with guys who aren't necessarily directly involved in battle right and so the question became\nWhat's the source of it and she said well it's nervous exhaustion said the human nervous system can only take it for so long and then everybody's nervous system shuts\nDown hence the term operational exhaustion so that's example again when you're trying to enrich it you're saying the guys aren't cowards and not in the state of shock they're behaving the way all human beings do and then\nYou get more concerned about them and you say the real problem isn't there just their experience on the battlefield the problem is is that they're in a constant state of disorder because it lingers on long after you think it's over you can't just get these guys into a hospital for six months and\nThink they're going to be better there permanently you they have post traumatic shock and then once you have a a a whole apparatus to deal with it then you become pie TST my point is just that it's perfectly possible that the language of euphemism grows and becomes more abstract\nAs ... as people actually are becoming more empathetic to the people who suffer from it\nSo ... do you buy I mean he's he's basically turned Carlin on his head and he's made the wintering blender words enrichment\nI I have I mean my only move would be to hit play on Carlin\nPoor people used to live in slums now the economically disadvantaged occupy substandard housing in the inner cities [noise]\nThey don't have a negative cash flow position\nYou know fired management want it to curtail redundancies in human resources area\nSo many people are no longer viable members of

do\nLesson number four imagine a lot of Coca Cola like rubble for your time [noise] ... that's the beauty beat overcrowded now your truck [noise]\nPretty good [noise]\nThis is Emily Emily with us here I'm an artist\n[noise]\nSome of you may remember that a couple of years ago we did a story about Emily where she'd been hit by a truck\nGoing into a coma and her boyfriend at the time Alan or had brought her back my writing on her hands\nHer name [noise]\nOf all the stories we've ever done I think this one has gotten the most response and when we left that story Emily had emerged from the Komen begun to recover\nBut she was blind totally blind right yeah like no light any can nothing coming in now okay needless to say it was a very big adjustment\nI just know I just had to develop my own ways to navigate throughout the world and chest myself and\nAnd being a visual artist she had to develop new ways to\nDraw and ... and if you ... it's hard enough you can feel the lax on the paper [noise] um\nYeah but then one day in the summer of two thousand and twelve she gets a call\nFrom the White House school in New York City the lighthouse school yeah it's a school for the blind\nHer mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology\nI think they were doing this study for the FDA\nVery experimental and her mom signed her up long story short a Emily shows up to light how school one day and walks into the room and a guy named ed\nGives her this thing he get his device can you describe it I mean is it a big helmet now\nIt's not it's just say ... ... s and glasses\nThough they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses she says because of right on the front like on a bridge in the nose was a little camera going forward\nAnd then attached to the sun glasses was a little wire\nThat ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal\nThing has made a titanium and it's just like the size of a postage stamp and little bit thicker though\nAnd explain to her that the little piece of titanium was filled with thousands of electrodes and what was going to happen is at the camera was going to convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square so he told her to take a little square plays it on your time put it right on the center of your tongue\nAnd caused him out\nSo I put it on and they\nTurn it on 'em and it was like is there is to take all imagine a lot of Coca Cola like a lot of the halls on your town and always fight technically\nThe idea behind this thing cording to science writer Sam Kean author of detail of doing or surgeons is that we actually see with our brain not our eyes I mean it might seem like our eyes are doing the seeing in our ears during the hearing and our fingers in ... in the teasing hedging\nBut that's actually not how it works each of our senses send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerves and it is the brain that then convert those little blips into what you perceive as a site or a sound or smell now obviously\nSomeone who was blind the retina is not sending those signals anymore but what if there is another way to get signals for light and dark and color into our brains\nAll of our brains there lots and lots of passed away she going from every part of the brain to every other part of the brain and normally your brain isn't using those pathways even though they exist like there's a road there but it's shut down in traffic can be\nIt but what if you could open up some of those wrapped\nIn Asia sent me a set with an eye for an hour two hours\nAnd ... says at first she had no idea what was happening she would just with all her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue change and every\nTime I looked around he said oh that's a chair that door that's me\nActually mine and it went on like this for awhile et cetera ball in a square of ... I think the nana and nothing was really happening for except for the perfectly feelings on her tongue but then there was this moment\nAdd had this really long Styrofoam God and he last day in front of me he moved it up and down and find them I think [noise] ... oh my God ... suddenly she says she just thought it was like oh my God [laughter]\nIt just happened I I don't ... what does it look like in so many minds I Am let's\nLike oh long white skinny stick did you see the texture of the sticker um no\nI couldn't see ... I couldn't see in three dimensions it was very\nFlat and it's kind of light that kid's toy like right yeah ... like a black screen and little tiny white dots all arranged in a line\nTo Emily was allowed to keep the brain poor device for about a year and a half and during that time the light\nRight resolution of it did get better as your brain learn to speak tone\nIs also when I saw people\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom and sent me showing her wearing the device in walking down the street she told me they usually you know now\nThat she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially at a town where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nSo I uh [noise]\nI hardly ever notice and if people walking around me I feel like\n\nI can I hear the ... and the sound the topic\nBut she says when she puts a device on and put those sensor undertone the sidewalk [noise]\nThought it was amazing I I didn't\nKnow that this many people around the state at the same time is ... and now they're um [noise] they're all there again which you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike really soft ... ... anything that sounds nice South Bronx is as\nHe can move\nIn there and that's just smell it opens in and out pops me but you're saying that there's this thing that is reading these three base pairs and forming any of a hundred thousand proteins suddenly I'm thinking that's where the game is not not the DNA but in the thing that's reading the DNA well yeah I mean\nDNA is just a totally meaningless molecule just flopping around unless\nThere is a way of reading it\nBut doesn't the ... the the reader of the DNA come from the DNA sure his that's his weird yes so you have to say you have genes for\nThe parts of the ride the film\nAt this point a producer to an hour and a pretty stern wheeler stepped in it's like a book that birth its own reader that's set will read the book not exactly though because that does you you\nYou are sort of putting DNA up on a pedestal\nBut it ... it ... it is a ...\n... it is it's it's it's first but his do DNA how's DNA first what you're saying it's in the order of events you begin with DNA and then after that you get the ride is on the day events of what a view\nOkay but but you got to bear in mind that you I I don't know how far back you want to go [laughter] no seriously where do we start with you you want to start jazz the fertilized egg\nWell are you sure yes okay is Chad the fertilized egg has DNA and he's right beside homes\nOh so the readers already present when a cell divides two new copies of DNA go into each new cell but they also divided up all the ... from the original cell so they're taking the factories with them a\nSo he's the DNA is never without the code\n... Moses with the tablets together [laughter] and\nI'm a regular is a no and I just say I've never thought of it that way I Need to think about this um right what\nMakes the rabbit Simpson does it come from the DNA that's like you just said that [laughter] yes\nIt is that how does it make the rounds on without a driver's on to help him make the rap zone what wait ... okay [laughter]\nWell how do you translate or their DNA codes for the ... and how do you make the rhymes on without a wrap his own to translate the code to make the robbers on you couldn't way to say I'm I'm so you're right you got to take the DNA and the ... film partnership\nAll the way back billions of years these two parts of the system evolved and became depended on each other very early in history of life\nIn fact Carl says a lot of biologists think the life\nStarted out as just aren't they know DNA and\nSo you basically have a little little organisms that would have these little kind of proto genes made of our nay and eventually um these aren't any molecule\nStarted to connect amino acids together to make the little building blocks of proteins so you're saying that people generally think Arnie came first that is one of a couple I'm leading\nOkay office he's today so it's possible that aren't came first then DNA somehow suddenly I'm thinking oh we\n... we should have been talking about our nail the along [laughter]\nWell I mean just in general or nay has been incredibly neglected and ignored and\nThe Bible instead of in the beginning was word should have been in the beginning was the person reading the word or in the beginning was the code yeah [noise]\nDid you guys feel the ... just now\nI really know there there was some kind of vibration happening\nAnd in my head to because I was thinking I finally get it now like I get it can\nCause DNA got sold to us is like this is the first step and understanding the mystery of life that somehow doesn't feel like that anymore suddenly like our name to ride this out [noise]\nA sheriff's deputies police officers schoolteachers people at work down at the local hardware store these or you know central workforce for these communities yet in many cases along the beaches and these coastal communities where they live\nThere being priced out as the cost of rebuilding so high but also as investors the opportunity to go in and and develop these areas\nWhere we saw a lot of that in Miami actually our team was down reporting there earlier this summer and um we saw that there were places that were essentially gentrifying as people were moving inland to try and uh you know live places where they weren't going to be affected by hurricanes\nUp throughout the state of Florida particularly ... hurricanes I saw this tendency that we were displacing the working class we were displacing the poor and the name of new development that was often times are being built on top of areas that\nThe previous hurricanes ... former FEMA administrator and former head of emergency management for the state of Florida Craig thank you so much thanks for having meal [noise]\nLet's turn now to the future how can we design community to be more resilient in the face of climate change here to help us figure this out as sad Miller a professor at the school for future of innovation and society at Arizona State University Thanks for joining us that thank you for having me so that we hear this word resilience\nLobbed around left and right when we're talking about building our city what are we talking about what does that actually mean\nRight that's a great question one that cities are grappling with right now and I think there's a tendency to to focus on the hard infrastructure or when we think about resilience than it is that a but it's also about how our environmental a systems are positioned uh for example wetlands\nThat had been eroded up before Katrina came actually contributed to a worst storm but it's also our social systems so that means\nBoth the ability of communities are to bounce back um and to come together before during and after an event but it's also how our organizations are able to create more resilient communities and infrastructure and respond to those events\nAnd ... and when we think about infrastructure I mean we with our previous guest we talked a little bit about these ... you know the category for storms we've had four in the past couple of storm season we're seeing lots of damage to infrastructure and lots of attempts that building back\nShould we be trying to build things that will withstand anything and everything that nature will throw at us or are you seeing resilience is something that you know perhaps might fail and be able to bounce back more quickly\nRight um I think you know that will depend on where you are and community needs and I think it'll end up being both strategies\nA there may be hard there may be infrastructure in place that you just have to say you know we cannot move this power plant right now or at least not for the next Thirty years so we have to make sure that nuclear system for example a is protected but there may be other examples where after a storm\nYou know what it does make more sense uh to to give more room to the river or to get more room to the to the shoreline and you see that happening\nIn places from Staten Island in New York City all the way to the Columbia River and discussions with a cattle farmers about uh how do we how do we let this flood but then compensate you with us\nAnd one of the things that comes up often when we're talking about disaster recovery is cost um we you mentioned Staten Island here in New York We're still there's still some folks who were trying to recover from Hurricane Sandy which feels like it was ... to go obviously were ... you know we see folks are dealing with Michael and dealing with Hurricane Maria\nWho is supposed to pay for this type of resilience who do you see is responsible\nFor the long term recovery of these places um and then you know where does the burden really fall here\n[noise] yeah that's a that's a great question I'm and I'm not sure that I have the perfect answer other than to say I think it's all hands on deck um I Know New York or after after Sandy I'm has been looking in the sense that they've been able to ah bring both local of funding for that but also a federal funding\nBut other cities who maybe haven't had a recent disaster right um and then therefore I don't have the attention or maybe the access to the federal funding\nFor recovery that a New Yorker others might have ah are still trying to think about how to fund this so that we're resilient in advance of an event and and and so that they can they don't have the the next Sandy happened to them for example um and so that is about you know what our local uh organizations in local taxpayers willing to bear to prepare for weather and climate\nWell I think that's the that's the question because when we think about this I I often think what should we\nYou know about resilience I mean is it a question that we have to ask ourselves even more difficult questions about where we decide to build at all I'm thinking about the coastlines I'm thinking about places that are much more\nLikely to be affected should taxpayers be you know dealing with that burden if they themselves aren't the ones who were building in these more precarious areas like who does the burden really fall on at that point if I decide if my home is destroyed and then I decided to build it back\nYou know aren't I taking the risk of of um having a destroyed again\nRight exactly and and in some cases maybe it is that\nThose shoreline properties are that are wealthier neighborhoods as a you were talking with your previous guest a but in other cases it it may be communities that\nDon't really have the resources to recover or to build back up because that neighborhood was known as a low lying inland flooding neighborhood and no one else wanted to live there and so uh it it became a a lower income area and so I think it depends um and and you pointed out with your previous guests as well that the insurance system as a as a big part of this\nUm and I think there's going to have to be discussions I'm a between you know federal and local levels and insurance companies about how to best or create a system that\nThat is resilient right it's not just a hard infrastructure that needs to be resilient but it's also these other systems including insurance and an economic system that needs to go into this as well\nRight and also city planning I'm thinking you know a lot of these cities that we ... a lot of the places we live in as you mentioned it initially probably we're not dealing with these\nUh forces like they're dealing with now or what what do you think it would take to actually climate proof our communities is that even possible I mean I Know we're we're reporting on the fact that in the next couple of decades if we don't do something soon we're in a bad situation here climate life\nFor sure but I think the the key point there is that it's not that plan or is that engineers haven't thought about climate and weather or it's just that the climate and weather um that they built into infrastructure over the past fifty plus years\nThat knowledge is now I dated and it's built for climate and weather patterns that really no longer exists 'em yet the storm water pipes that you put it in the ground fifty or Seventy five years ago stopped to function now with a different climate\nUm and so I I think it's ... and and I think planners engineers et cetera at the at the city level are increasingly are realizing that uh and it's a it's a real issue whether they're going to be tackling with it\nA under something called resilience or an office of resilience or they're just sticking together about a and noticing the changes in weather patterns and and and how to more effectively deal with as knowing that the future is not going to be like the past\nThat briefly do you see any hope here I'm thinking of the subways in New York City now that when it rains it's almost rains underground at this point because their infrastructure is so a broken\nRight [noise] I mean I I Do see some hope that maybe that's my ... my personality but I I think cities increasingly see this as fundamental hum and cities in communities want their infrastructure to work so they can be economically competitive healthy vibrant places I think that you see that's that's

conversation not MRI plus the latest on the search for some ... and the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nI think one of the biggest issues are just structural issues no reservations are often remote and there are significant distances um that Native Americans are being forced to travel in order to cast their ballot or even when they request polling locations um those requests are being denied\nAnd so we've been hearing throughout Indian country that it's not uncommon to have to travel twenty forty miles to vote and there are some egregious examples I for example in Nevada\nIn death valley voters have to travel as far as a hundred and fifty miles round trip in order to cast a vote a which equates to on a good day about four and a half hours of travel time\nOne of the things that we noticed in in North Dakota was that this ruling essentially would borrow make it more difficult for people with just a PO box address to vote rather than those that have a residential street address is that something that you're seeing and other states\nYes it's starting to become a problem um there is a housing crisis on a Native American reservations in twenty Seventeen for about eleven thousand members of the northern ... uh in Wyoming there were just two hundred and thirty reservation homes\nUm which led to averaging about forty eight people her home and so this housing crisis is creating that I'm a problem where Native Americans don't have\nA residential street address it because they're moving from home to home but also in these remote areas those homes may not even have an address on them to begin with\nUm and so it's literally impossible for people to comply with a residential street address requirement\nUm and instead they're depending upon PO box is which have a lot of floods uh in order to conduct their affairs and so these kind of barriers to housing are gonna start translate into barriers the ballot box if we don't create a system\nThat that doesn't rely on residential street addresses\nWhy are we only having this conversation now I feel like the timing of this decision and everything else just seems like uh there should be some some system in place for this community I mean this isn't something that just happened the other day\nNo I mean they direct right fun we've been litigating this case since twenty four teams we saw in it and that election we sell widespread disenfranchisement\nOf the native community uh and so uh you know we immediately filed suit we received relief from the law and twenty sixteen because the federal district court found that it was in fact discriminatory\nUm and that I had a burden some impact on Native Americans the legislator slightly tweak the law in twenty Seventeen or the district court again found that that law was discriminatory um because it kept the discriminatory features which are than where are the address and the you know IDs\nThat were you know really strict in number and hard to get\nA you know Native American issues are often under reported um you know over the past year we conducted a series of field hearings around Indian country to sort of ask what are these barriers keeping you from voting and um this is you know one of the first times that these communities had been asked that\nQuestion Jacqueline deli on as a member of the is let up ... and staff attorney at Native American

here um let's talk about the history a little bit about the history of where the Proud Boys fit into our history with hate groups I was thinking back to when I was growing up in New York City and there were quote unquote skinheads and you saw them every now and then but are the Proud Boys unique\nI think they're a part of our\nShift and culture and what I mean by that is to say white supremacy in our most recent past was to trigger notion of white pride and all kinds of hatred against even the idea of racial integration\nAre move overtime or it has been too as a nation embrace a sense of oh no we're more than just white and we can take pride in being more than just white\nSo what is so fascinating and I have to say disturbing um about the ... and some of these other youth culture pro white organizations is that they're actually attracting men of color\nAnd men who identify as mixed race as well\nPart of that that I find so disturbing is that it enables the organizations to say see we're not racist were just pro white as a culture and anybody wants to join back is welcome to join us including these men of color who are sort of\nAlso very much enamored or the idea of white and this as a status and also some key a binary here is the anti blackness is a key feature of their platform\nOkay so we have to take a short break but when we come back we'll have more with both of you
