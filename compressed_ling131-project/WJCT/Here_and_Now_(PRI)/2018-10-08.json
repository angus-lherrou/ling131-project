Jacksonville your community your world fifty percent chance of showers and thunderstorms today mostly cloudy and the upper eighties breezy from the east with wind gusts twenty eight miles per hour mid seventies tonight this [noise]\nIs radio our [noise]\nEach week groundbreaking had talked\nTo the technology entertainment design design is that really what the temperature of never known that delivered and Ted conferences around the\nWorld gift of the human imagination we've had to believe in impossible thing\nThe true nature of reality that can\nJust beyond those talks those ideas\nFrom NPR [noise]\nI'm Guy rise coming up\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works ah every year I think we are where we are what we need to do is figure out how the brain does it as a biological piece of machinery we now have technology that could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their you know [noise]\nThere are many diseases who's genetic causes have been pinpointed precisely a most common genetic diseases cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia Huntington's disease we've known about those you know since the eighties and nineties\n... and and presumably we can pinpoint things that aren't diseases at all\nSure to the shape of our noses that was a recent paper that was published twenty three and be just released a study a defining the associations between gene\nVariants and whether or not you're a morning person while we're talking about the kinds of things that are out of out of the water cooler or on your way to get a coffee and we're beginning to understand\nThe DNA sequences that can explain those behaviors it's it's pretty mind boggling\nWho we are what makes us us it's why the oldest questions out there but new technology means we've never been closer to answering it in all kinds of ways that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago\nSo today on the show ideas from science ecology and philosophy about why we are who we are\n\nSo Sam Steinberg worked in the lab that developed one of the most groundbreaking innovations in gene editing you may have heard of it it's called CRISPR and Sam described why it's such a big deal on the\nStage for over half a century that DNA contains the blueprints to make all living things that you can tell us a lot about ourselves better ancestry or traits and our disease susceptibility is\nBut there are things in the genome that you might not want to find out for example with two misspelled versions of a gene called April before your chance of developing Alzheimer's disease is more than ten times above average\nAnd with a single disease copy of the Huntington gene you virtually guaranteed Huntington's disease a devastating form of nerve the generation\nAnd they both of these cases there aren't currently any effective prevention or treatment options and so this leaves many wondering is this information even worth knowing\nWell what if we could do more than just learned that information by reading the genome\nBut actually rewrite the genome to cure genetic diseases at their source what if editing the letters of you know you were a simple and easy as fixing typos in Microsoft Word\nThis is no longer a science fiction thanks to a new tool called Christopher casts nine\nIn the last three years scientists have delivered CRISPR cast lines of human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that costs cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease\nGenome editing and animals themselves is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets\nAnd companies have already raised almost a billion dollars to apply Christopher cast nine as a therapy and patience\nThe CRISPR cast my technology was co invented in my PHD lab at the University of California Berkeley and many considered to be one of the biggest breakthroughs of the last couple of decades\nBut five years ago when I started my PHD with Jennifer Doudna CRISPR wasn't the technology at all\n[noise]\nSo you're saying this technology didn't even exist five years ago I mean how\nHas become a huge deal\nSo when I started my PHD and Jennifer's lab that was to any ten\nYou wouldn't find a single mention of Christopher in you know the lay media unless it was talking about a vegetable CRISPR\nA but in the scientific literature we're really talking a few dozen articles so it was about maybe one month was coming out read now or at a point today where every day we have around five or ten articles being published I think you will will not find a biologist in the world\nThat doesn't know about Chris ... and you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR allow to study whatever biological question they go after and there are laboratories because\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works\nAnd if we know that you know in codes life than what better than a tool to rewrite the DNA and study what the effects are\nOkay the technical details of how CRISPR cast nine works are complicated CRISPR for instance is an acronym for clustered regularly into space to short\n... repeat and ... is the key protein that makes it all work but what you need to know if that CRISPR cast nine makes it easy in a relatively inexpensive to edit genes in precise waste any gene ... any living thing from bacteria or to people\nYou know coming back to the four letters of DNA thinking about those eight hundred dictionaries filled with the same for letters and mail imagine that you have to search for a single page and not just single page but a single letter on that page\nAnd mark that site for a change and maybe not any change but an aid to Haiti not an easy or an aide to see [noise]\nSo for decades this was the kind of pine disguise science fiction idea that we could dream about doing but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter absolutely\nThat's exactly what it does and I'll just add one copy out it's not been demonstrated yet in human patients so if you just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish absolutely with human patients comes the additional challenge of\nGetting to the right cells and that's the same challenge at every drug has to contend with this this issue of delivery and now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patience\nNow the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health Kennedy achieved his ultimate goal of sharing a genetic disease at a source at the level of DNA instead of just treating the downstream symptoms\nImagine if you're trying to retrieve stem cell technology together with Chris protests nine to remove disease cells from patients repair them in the lab and the transplant those corrected cells back into the body\nClinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV aids by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patience and I suspect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with CRISPR entering the pipeline to the next few years\nWhat really got folks speaking this past year was the report in may but for the first time ever scientists use CRISPR cast line to edit the DNA in human embryos\nAnd unlike therapy and adult patients this would introduce heritable changes that can be passed on to subsequent generations you can imagine the controversy that this has provoked\nAnd many fear that this technology can be abused that it would usher in an era of eugenics were designer babies were select few could pick and choose the best use for their offspring\nOthers would say a free deny unborn children a technology that could ease human suffering or eradicated disease it would be immoral\nCRISPR cast line is forcing us to rethink what kind of world we want to live in [noise]\nAnd they're already ethical issues to discuss about how we should use this technology and how it should be regulated [noise]\nThat Sam ... when we come back in just a minute [noise] a little more about how gene editing could change\nWho we are and how we should feel about that on the show

responsible drinking and from the any tape the foundation\nIs that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in our show today ideas\nAbout who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking to ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I ...\nAnd make decisions and the decisions affect the way the world treats us including other people and we take away lessons from how we've been treated\nAnd so we set off with a combination of our unique genome and our a chain of experiences\nOkay just to clarify our environment is helping mould our genes\nOh obviously that is if I was brought up as an Apache or as a a a Japanese samurai or as a Romanian peasant and the fourteenth century there'll be differences undoubtedly compared to who I Am now\nSo we just have to ... about you know like how being a morning person is is possibly in that it has genetic codes so so what else are we probably born with\nSo are we know that that intelligence has a a a big heritable component which doesn't mean that it is\nA completely determined by our genes but it doesn't mean that some of the differences among people can be attributed differences among their genes we know that the differences in personality how conscientious how agreeable erotic how extroverted\nA are influenced by a by our genome and even behavioral traits such as ah how likely are you to be a smoker or an alcoholic all of them show some influence of a of our genetic endowment [noise]\nAnd even though we can now prove our genomes to actually ... some of these things out the maker says there's another slightly bizarre\nOld fashioned method such as looking at similarities between identical twins who are separated at birth because identical twins separated at birth share all of their genes but of course not their environments and they show that there is a a a pretty hefty statistical\nInfluence of the genes that is if you know what one identical twin is like you can make a lot of predictions about the other one who he or she may never have met me growing up uh an ocean in at a cultural way\nMy favorite example is a a pair of twins one of whom was brought up a as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany\nThe other was brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad when they walked into the lab and Minnesota fan wearing identical navy blue shirts with apple and both of them like two different buttered toast and coffee\nBoth of them ... rubber bands around the rest of them flush the toilet before using it as well as an actor\nTo a surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them John [laughter]\nSorry my thing too good to be true\nUh when you administer a fat or even psychological uh you get the same results namely identical twin separated at birth show out quite astonishing similarities [noise] that's just\nUnbelievable so then like even like like habits or or personality quirks are more or less assigned at birth\nWell they're they're influenced at birth I wouldn't say they're assigned because there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain and gels and the first couple of years of life\nAh there are changes that that to unfold over the lifespan\nWhether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the the brain spontaneously develops we don't really know\nYeah there are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged if you if you undergo a trauma or abuse that can leave lasting scars but I think there's certainly a um their statistical forces there's there's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board\nYeah I mean when when you look at like who you are\nI mean do you do you think you're the same person that you were when when you were a child or or a teenager or in your twenties as as you are now\nI I Do see myself is basically the same kind of person I like the same music I like same foods I liked the St pastimes I have I have similar kinds of interests\nAre and then and research on personality shows that there was a a a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character or as they go through life\nBut a ... there's certain changes that I see myself that probably occurred in most people would say that they get older we get less erotic we get nicer\nAh we get less anxious as we get older all of us but still if one person is more anxious than another at the age of twenty or he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of Seventy as well even if both of them are less anxious across the board\nI mean if we are more or less the same right at twenty or at Seventy isn't even possible to make big changes to to who we are\nI think we have the capacity to change our behavior which is really what counts I I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in the sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming um constitutionally calm and uh and easy going\nBut certainly there are methods of fake cognitive behavior therapy that are proven effective at reducing anxiety and phobias and treating depression yeah uh\nAnd the thing is that those don't appeal to a some if serial immaterial soul they uh are ways of acting on our neural circuitry\nWe have to keep in mind that are neural circuitry is so intricately complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social\nMechanisms of of interacting to language to facial expression the body language that\nThere are ways of of changing our feelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation and example and uh and and art and of\nEvidence based psychotherapy so there is a scope for for a range of behavior within the ... with a given personality type and we can probe the outside of the on hope that the genes make available to us\n... do you when you think about what what animated person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious huge\nParts of it are are certainly mysterious because he interactions are so unfathomable complex yeah there are I tend to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion senses and no one can keep track of all of them even a ... in a computer simulation\nWe also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or environments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together and not not the exotic cases of twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins at all of us know\nIf he knows a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar than two people plucked off the street at random\nBut they're unique individuals that they you you don't confuse them when once you know and sometimes they're not France and sometimes they're not friends are indeed a now how do you account for those differences it's not ... at least not the ones they inherited from their parents that could be some uh a few mutations that each one a idiosyncratic\nAcquired a it's not there by larger environments because they grew up in the same parents the same school the same house the same older ... younger sibs\n[noise] really forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for a fair chance for the role of the dice in a way become because ah\nTo people who have everything in common

I I decided to do it and I go in the cabin I came here yeah and that's a very useful to distinguish these different kinds of ... of actions but it doesn't mean that the experience of religion\nCaused the action\nAnd this doesn't mean that relational behavior doesn't exist of course it's a thing and every action that we experience is voting tree is shaped by a whole history of previous violent reactions um that we've\nExecuted during our lifetimes about social and cultural context of a developmental and and even our evolutionary heritage indeed there all of these factors play in to every action that we do whether we experience it as ... well not\nSo I mean the thing about consciousness disease that's what makes us us right like like that's what makes us human but there are a lot of people in the world who who believe that we are not that far off from like\nAI becoming conscious right and and behaving in responding thinking as when you do that's right I mean\nI think that belief is driven by a couple of factors one factor is just this this cultural a phenomenon ... we've had this throughout culture of of robots developing intelligence and then becoming conscious me for you to see is right and we see this for me to read this with time and I said we see this Blade Runner\nI'm In very different ways you know I Love Blade Runner I'm a bit frustrated by determination views\nOf future technology and write books we see this in a beautiful film ex McAnuff which I think really interrogate the philosophical issues behind this\nIn a huge interesting way but yeah that's this cultural trucks that intelligence and consciousness go together and that I Will develop awareness at some point um the other factor that's playing into it and this is the one I think is perhaps a bit more\nDamaging is what I have come to a quarter punishes ... and this isn't the idea that we ...\nWe say well what's special about as we were trying to find out what's special about us maybe it's not that we have a soul and other animals died\nWell maybe it's that we're intelligent maybe we have minded is somehow different an order of magnitude different from the minds of other creatures or or of objects its intelligence that sets us apart and makes a special and we were so conscious\nSo does this tendency we have to associate these two things together well you know we're intelligent\nAnd we're conscious so intelligence and consciousness should go together\nBut actually that really doesn't have to be the case you certainly don't have to be very intelligent in order to experience pain and suffering and so we can imagine that that's plenty of\nOther animals that may not school very highly you on a very human centric measure of intelligence but nonetheless have they been conscious experiences\nSo to me these things why against the idea that that guy is headed on an inevitable trajectory towards being conscious but yet it's certainly possible that the near future we'll see as being able to build up to facts that give the impression\nOf being conscious that somebody picks out a very interesting spices future [laughter] what will happen\nTo our interactions with each other and with other animals when our environment support to like to buy things that give the appearance of being conscious of being in touch but for which we have no\nWay really of knowing whether they are well no certainly no confidence in saying that they all countries [noise] is that going to change the way we do have the things that are actually conscious I think that's a definitely a worry\nAnd

hit you'll with a parent pent up anger about president from the two thousand sixteen election\nHere that has been unfairly still developing a judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars\nOn it from outside left wing opposition groups\nAmong Americans there is increasing concerned that the Supreme Court is becoming a partisan and political body and the recent controversy over judge Kavanaugh's appointment which included an FBI investigation may only further divided the nation and its opinion of the court\nProfessor Barbara Perry is with us and she's the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center Dr Perry thanks for joining the takeaway oh it's my pleasure [noise]\nSo let's start with some fundamentals what is the role of the Supreme Court Dr Perry and how has that rural lined up historically with how Americans view the Supreme Court [noise]\nSometimes the court and the federal judiciary are called the third branch so when we think about their role I often think of it is that third voice in our three branches of government\nAnd have Americans generally viewed the court as fair\nYes we have developed this image of the court that is above the ... of daily politics\nNow I'm going to uh make an assumption here Dr Perry that that perception has greatly and drastically changed [noise] there's good\nNews and bad news I think for the court in this realm I after what we've just been through over the last few weeks the good news for the court is that\nIt almost always out paces Congress or the president when approval ratings are taken the bad news is as we've just been saying over these last few weeks and particularly with the most recent controversies surrounding justice Kavanaugh it may be that the court will take a hit on that\nBut let's think back to Bush Gore in two thousand polarized nation polarized vote on George Bush and Al Gore\nAnd the court polarized five to four in effect deciding Bush Gore in favor of Bush and giving him the presidency despite the fact that he had lost the popular vote the court ended up with a sixty percent approval rating and you say well how could that be\nPolarization Ninety percent of Republicans polled agreed with the court's decision and Bush Gore only thirty percent of Democrats did but the average was sixty percent so we could find in this highly polarized time and which we live\nIs it maybe Ninety percent of Republicans approve of judge Kavanaugh now maybe only thirty percent of Americans do or maybe even less but the court could still come out with a pretty high approval\nRating this well it could come out with a pretty high approval ratings skewed towards the conservative a slash Republican ideology here I think and I'm Wondering if you've seen or recall a time when a nominee\nA spoke so politically during a hearing um did a prime time television interview and even wrote an op ed in advance of the final confirmation vote as justice Kevin audit\nNo I Can't that doesn't mean that it didn't happen but I Can't recall it offhand I think that's because that's with all things in the era of Donald Trump most of this was unprecedented now people thought back of course to Clarence Thomas and the hearings twenty seven years ago over Anita Hill and there were many parallels there\nBut the one parallel that didn't exist that even though Justice Thomas at that time Judge Thomas was very upset in his second round of hearing about the Anita Hill charges of sexual harassment that were made against him he didn't attack\nThe senators you could tell he was angry at them but he didn't disrespect them and he didn't make part isn't statements are like the ones that that you played that justice Kavanaugh gave\nDr Perry what does the appointment of justice Kavanaugh and as you mentioned Justice Thomas mean\nI mean these are two Supreme Court justices accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault women have testified and that's not prevented these appointments from happening so what messages the sending to American women who have now seen this happen twice\nThat's unprecedented as well we're living in the me too moment we're living in certainly twenty four seven media coverage social media coverage and the court has never been exposed in this way doesn't mean that the court has never been controversial it has been going back to the founding and\nFights between the Jeffersonian and the federalist over Supreme Court appointments of all things\nBut we've never had a third of the men on the U.S Supreme Court accused of sexual misbehavior be that harassment or actually sexual assault and say that can't work in the courts favor\nOne thing that's also come up is whether or not he will be required to recuse himself\nParticularly in light of the statements he made in his hearing if the court receives a case about ah the president or Russia or anything related to that is that the case will he be required to recruit recuse himself in a word\nNo and the key is the concept of recusing himself he cannot be recused in other words he would have to do that himself it does happen and and in fact when he was an associate justice William Rehnquist recused himself from the infamous\nUs being Nixon and Watergate tapes case rank was had served and the Justice Department under Nixon and so he took himself out of the case\nOn the other hand Justice Scalia who was good friends with vice president Cheney had gone duck hunting with him in fact I did not recused himself from a case involving the vice president during the Bush forty three era\nSo I think it's unlikely that Brett Kavanaugh's going to recuse himself from cases that could involve partisanship that could involve us things that he said in his most recent hearing and certainly those instances in which President Trump is that issue\nAnd that would lead me to believe that there is a large percentage of the population who will continue to not have as much faith in the Supreme Court as they once might have\nI'm afraid that could be the case the court has been damaged no doubt by this controversy just as it was damaged I think by the Clarence Thomas controversy but the\nCourt moves on these people serve and this is what gets people upset at confirmation time but these people serve for decades time marches on\nPeople actually forget and so I think that\nThe court as it has been described by Oliver Wendell Holmes is the center of the storm but it's a quiet at the center of the storm and justice Thomas's reported that when he arrived at the court even after that most controversial hearing over the Anita Hill allegations he was welcome\nA onto the bench by his new colleagues and so the court tries to again go above the ... daily politics and I suspect that as a body as a corporate entity it will do so whether the American people will see it that way is another story\nBarbara Perry is director of

really speaks to the fact that these buildings are just not prepared to handle a major earthquake\nOr were these the same buildings where these buildings that were still suffering from the twenty ten

major earthquake is coming they just don't know when and they just don't know the magnitude\nAnd of course in here in the United states the Trump Administration has said it wants to end temporary protected status for Haitians and other immigrants that are living in the United states despite the fact that a federal judge blocked that decision last week\nThe thousands of Haitians could end up facing deportation depending on how this plays out in the courts what impact could that have given this latest natural disaster\nWell it's going to have a major impact because when you think about the port region and the north it really is sustained by people who are living outside of Haiti the country already has issues with the economy it really has not recovered since twenty ten and now on top of this you have this earthquake here that has happened and so things are going to be difficult for a while\nWhen of course the Haitian president has also been under political pressure um after the

more than three hundred black Americans in what had been a thriving black owned business district of Greenwood sometimes called black Wall Street the mob also burned down the town leaving more than ten thousand people homeless\nIt was one of the most horrific episodes of racial violence in us history and after it was over the mob is said to have dumped the victims bodies in a mass grave that allege a grave site has not yet officially been investigated but that may change soon joining me with that story is Janine brown and Washington Post reporter\nDeneen thanks so much for being with the takeaway\nThank you why don't we hear more about this story Janine\nWell for many years it was only whispered about from my reporting white people said that they didn't talk about it out of shame of what happened and for many years the perpetrators were alive in Tulsa\nBlack people didn't talk about it or they only whispered about it out of fear\nThat it might happen again the Klan was very active in Tulsa during the year so for many years they say state city officials just covered it up it was left all the textbooks many people grow up in Tulsa didn't hear about it until they were adults\nIn Nineteen Ninety seven a state commission was organized to start\nInvestigating to find out what exactly happened that was eighty years after it happened so they interviewed the the remaining survivors many of them were in their nineties\nSomewhere a hundred who could recall very specifically what happened and that was also the year that the state began to investigate these reports surfaced mass graves in Tulsa\nThey identified three sites one was a dump had been used as a dump in Nineteen Twenty one to others for\nCemeteries and Nineteen Twenty one\nAnd at each site they found what they called anomalies they use ground penetrating radar defined you know what was and they cite so the report said that they found anomalies the more consistent with what navy mass graves\nThey suggested that the city physically examined this mass grave site but at the time the mayor decided against physically examining the side and the investigation was close what's\nThe change in because the mayor of Tulsa a has announced a new investigation into this um a legit mass grave what is the expectation um what are they hoping to find is meant to close that chapter or maybe even open that chapter in history and reconcile with it\nWell the mayor says of the city hopes to heal from this massacre that happened nearly one hundred years ago the ... them he said when he was city council member and\nTwo thousand twelve he pulled himself that if he were ever mayor than he would investigate like physically investigate fees\nMass grave sites [noise] he was elected mayor he said that he has the executive authority now to re open the investigation\nHe told me in an interview he says we owe it to the community to know if there are a mass graves in our city will do everything we can to find out what happened in Nineteen Twenty one\nAnd until the questions are answered until they investigate every site but the city will continue to be haunted\nWhat's the reaction been from black Oklahomans and from the wider community\n[noise] the activist I talked to were ecstatic that the mayor had announced that he would reopen the investigation they have been working for so many years to try to get the city to\nReopen the investigation and to just to to find peace for the people whose bodies were never found and Nineteen Twenty one they believe that justice was never served
