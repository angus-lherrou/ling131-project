{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "I think it was um a clarion moment a and over the last year Charlottesville has proved to be a very bad moment for them\nAnd everything was bad about it it was bad PR because it was gross because normal people wouldn't want to be involved in a disgusting we're all in the streets or the sea swastika flags or\nTo see the sort of\nA just a bad\nScene everything was bad about it in terms of PR except for the fact that the president of the United states tried to salvage what they were saying they showed up\nTo say that Confederate memorials or American history and they represent white history and taking them down as it attack on white people and that's what they wanted to say and it all got lost in the chaos and the violence and the disorganization and the only thing that redeemed it was the fact\nThat the president was on their side or at least seem that way they're black\nAs a former leader of the white nationalist movement who has we know those views you know I ... the author of a book about black called rising out of hatred I interview was recorded in September will hear more of the new interview I recorded this morning with ... Saturday massacre at the tree of life synagogue\nAfter a break this is fresh air\n...\n\nNot\n...\n[noise]\n\n\n...\n\nUm\n\nThis is fresh air but talking to him more of the interview that we opened today show with the interview I recorded this morning about Saturday's massacre at the tree of life synagogue with Washington Post reporter ... who is also the author of the book rising out of hatred it's about white nationalism and one of its former young leaders\nAnti Semitic\nCrimes are on the rise the Anti Defamation league's annual report said that the number of reported anti Semitic incidents in the U.S surge fifty seven percent and twenty Seventeen that's the highest percentage since they started tracking anti Semitic crimes in Nineteen Seventy nine\nI'm the president has started up a lot of fear about immigrants from Mexico from Guatemala and Honduras in in the so called caravan are immigrants from um Muslim countries he's very concerned about and has stirred up a lot of fear about\nBut we have a home grown hate movement\nIn the United states and the\nThe mass shooting at the synagogue is just the most recent example of\nHow seriously do you think we need to take this home grown hate movement\nAnd do you think that that we as a nation and that our government is taking it seriously enough\nI don't think we're taking it seriously and I'm not sure it would be possible to take it seriously enough I think it's potentially the greatest threat that we face just if you look at last week with three major incidents of of far\nRight extremist terrorism and and our country I think that that that's a much more real threat than for instance a caravan of immigrants that thousands of miles away and and that is hoping to potentially come here and get jobs that\nI think that it's so Charlottesville on a mix of course\nYeah of course and the other thing is that among these really have a valid white nationalist groups and I didn't really understand when I began reporting this book that ah that white nationalist tentatively\nAnd Jews for almost everything and and and so I think when we see something like the the L report saying that last year was that was one of the the larger the earth for for threats and threats of violence against Jews I think they're almost two thousand accidents and it's\nUnfortunately not surprising to me because\nThese are the people that that white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through bringing an immigrant through a hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so they get a lot of the violent backlash and from from these white supremacist idea\n[noise] is this an unnerving time for you ...\nYeah it's it's usually honoring God for me I'm In part because when something when something like the synagogue shooting happens I'm\nI feel a haunted and depressed but I don't feel shock um in order to feel shock you have to be surprised and unfortunately these kind of and then are not surprising to me anymore and in fact it seems like there's a certain kind of inevitability that is true in terms of mass shootings in general are\nThat this country has not been able to address or solve them but it's also increasingly true in terms of Rio acts of eight a\nYou know I don't think that this will be the last one um and and I think probably like a lot of us I sort of\nLive live in fear and with a sense of ... of them when it's when it's in the next horrible thing like this going to happen\nYou know I was asked so thank you

for show and was told to I couldn't possibly has certain shows and uh that it was a wouldn't be appropriate\nI Wonder whether I mean you describe what happened after you came out and um this long period of fear and and obviously it must have been quite painful to endure that um how were you able to withstand it I mean what\nDo we have if you get desperate to trust me it's not fun but you have to stand for the things that you believe in you have to stay strong inside and I I don't know how else you do it\nI I Love the there's a T shirt in the ... when I was lost in America that said I stand on the right side of history and you have to believe that I genuinely believe that equality for everybody is better for the whole society [noise]\nSo after coming out and then dealing with everything that came with that Sandy's activation button was pressing again in twenty Fifteen this time [noise]\nFor women's rights [noise]\nDecided to found a brand new political party because he is the critical thing the one place women and men are absolutely equal is at the ballot box that nobody no idea what they're doing but didn't know how complicated it wants to stop the political party I sold it can't be that difficult men have been doing it for somebody\n[noise]\nSo it by calling it the women's equality pot a at a gay and straight away people said to me\nTo call it that\nDon't know I just thought we'd be clear um [noise]\n\nI've been doing to me secrets you know I just [noise]\nThat as much as\nI can tell\nYou how many times I've heard somebody say I'm not a feminist buff always think

get really angry about the party you know exploded with anger but when I\nWas I think I think that the way to get people to pay attention is to not to them and ... like some raging cousin who wants to run around with\nThat because actually I'm not like that I posed seem normal sensible human being who wants to try and make the best place and I'm very interested in like keep an eye here in the u._k. if the big increase in ratings that seems to be on the late night shows at all using humor as a\nWeapon in the current political situation\nUh I I think it's the way forward and nothing is more disarming to critic then you finding them sunny ... how do you call it a punching whose aim is to get a call ... when the women's equality\nWind isn't should pretend unfolded Idaho the pain can beg budget is wrong with you [laughter] it is yeah and also a life is full of things that we believe to be ... which are not true no woman ever been to ... in the sixties it was made up by a journalist\nI even looked it up on the Internet and I could not find anything about\nWhat happened was a whole to him I don't actually young as anything but a that was a time when a Vietnam or people who didn't want to get inside of and the Vietnam War but the ... and that that idea was conflated with the protests that were held at the Miss America contests\nAt the deed crown a sheep Miss America which is funny but nobody's instrument of that stuff that I Would have liked him so you\nCan either she said that's the thing like I suspect that you don't sit around and consciously think I Am going to use humor to advance by ideas but it just sort of your temperament\nIs that right this is absolutely and and I have to keep the money will just bad things happen in the ... about things every day and I think really this is happening now it's just so hot breaking and so I'm holding that the only thing I think you can do is you have to start combining it a bit I activism\nBut also with remembering that by human beings and we have a sense of humor I don't see any other way forward frankly because if you just something about those things you would just sold all day long and\nNow we're in the world for example the women have equal representation in positions of power they looked like a very quick look at the top one hundred companies in the London stock exchange in twenty sixty one hundred companies or how many women running\nSeven I supposed to be allies that seven main I'll run by men will cool Joan [noise]\n\nJoan running hundred company [noise]\nJane run by medical [noise]\nActual

unless we have more women at the top in the ... with the laws are the equal packed in Britain was passed in Nineteen Seventy five\nNevertheless there are still many many women who from November until the end of the year by comparison to them male colleagues are effectively wedding for free I in fact\nThe world Economic Forum estimates that women will get equal pay\nI mean all the examples that you give in your talk like more companies are run by Dave's or John are women who run companies I mean it would be funnier if it wasn't so depressing\nI Know I Know I'm ... I'm just trying to pointed out ah you know life is uh is is has its many amusing sides to it or I have to say I'm Mr\nTrump blessing has been a boon frankly a boon to ... so they could be depressed or you could just\nAlso find the funny side um and uh so it makes me smile and I have to say when I say something and I can see people go oh you know and they get\nRich but it makes me love ... and it just it ... the Greek\nDrama mosques which tragedy in comedy and they stood side by side and the Greeks knew that and we should know that that in the midst of this bad that we are still human and and the sense of humor and a good love is one of the things that makes us human loved it brings you together I think that's one of those in the last night and I had seven hundred people laughing together and\nWe don't even know each other but with the book together by that was\nSo we just got to keep going forward [noise]\n\nComedian Sandy toxic she hosts the show Q.

she's a standup comedian I'm Florian around things on drunk\nFor generations comedy taking the risks that no one else would weather was will and grace mainstreaming the ... community on prime time television or you know black fish right now I think comedy\nIs the easiest most reliable way to tell people things they don't want to hear\nYou know earlier you were you were saying that you didn't set out to be an activist or or an advocate but I mean you sometimes ended up changing people's\nMinds right right so like I've never been like okay if I'm going to talk about Palestine Israel and how people deserve equality regardless of faith I have to use comedy\nBecause otherwise people are going to get defensive\nIt's more like oh I'm going to tell a joke about when I was strip searched and I'm not really thinking about like this is the best way to deliver this message I'm thinking about this is a really funny story I'm totally and get them to laugh and then it's usually not till after the show where I'm like oh my God\nSomeone just came up to me and said they didn't know that Palestinians where people they thought that was the name of a terror group and it's like it's always afterwards that I realized I shaking someone's ground\nIt's never my intention to go out and do that my only intention is make them laugh get on General Hospital women\nIt's may soon as I can hear her full talk to dot com\nOkay so may soon was just saying that she's not a comedian and activists being you basically use comedy is like your form of activism yes\nComedy is like the best tool for that it just opens people up and what makes comedy so effective is that if you're making them laugh along the way they're going to listen to the deeper cuts stuff this is Nick\n... also a standup comic they use the daughter of Iranian immigrant and as a kid her parents were regalia her with stories about life during the Iran Iraq War specifically the unusual way they go through bombing range\nAnd they talked about how they would go into the\nBasement and how they would turn on the candles and how they would block out all the windows and they would be like oh we would play\nCards we raise and they tell stories and then we hear a bomb and then we worry that it was our neighbor you know and then\nAgain so I think the human capacity you\nKnow the way humans get through these really terrible times is by flipping the script on themselves a kind of lets you take the story back into your own hands\n... own turn flipping the script happened when she was in college right after September eleventh and the start of a wave of Islamophobia\nAnd it started becoming clearer and clearer that Islamophobia is one of those things it's not going away\nI kept thinking like oh will be will hate\nMuslims for like a few months and then we'll stop like I just thought that was going to be some reasonable projector\nUm and then it never never stopped you know and um and I felt like I could you know I had a voice and that my voice as an Iranian American Muslim was not\nSomething that the average American has already heard\nAnd ... and again decided that the best way to disarm the haters was to make them laugh and that's\nBeen the goal is just um you know if you have never had a Muslim friend um maybe my stupid face can be or Muslim friend\nAnd the game does is through what she calls social justice comedy and how it works well here's the gains explanation from the stage\nOf the population can be broken up and just remain categories there's mostly wonderful people haters and Florida\nTraveling category here are the haters\nComedian it's my goal to convert\nThese haters because they hate a lot of things which leads the negative outcomes like a racism violence and Ted Nugent on\nWe have to reckon with the haters but there's variance within this group and it's not a vision to go after all of them right someone\nCreated a highly scientific taxonomy ... basically took all of haters I put them in a petri dish like a scientist\nThe trolls they're the people who have quit their jobs so that they can post on Youtube videos all day long\nOn their haters now these people will be at a stoplight they'll wait for them to turn green and white male tree\nMost interested in is the swing hater they just don't have enough information and this is about like the target was social justice comedy because\nMakes you laugh right I don't think you enter into a state of openness and that moment of open it's a good social justice comedian can still get a whole bunch of information and if they're really skilled erectile exam\nFor social justice comedy first off it's not partisan okay this isn't political comedy this is about justice and no one is against justice\nI Want to hear what you're sitting inside of a burrito it's\nLike you're going to be hearing a real like an interesting treaties on income inequality that tasted are really sophisticated poop Joe\nOkay so she wanted to do something about Islamophobia and you want to look for swing haters\nSo me and another ... decided to round up like a bunch of Muslim American comedians I'm mad as per usual\nAnd take them around the country to places like Alabama and Tennessee and Mrs\nYou know what I mean just like places where you are accustomed to seeing like a\nBunch of friendly Muslims and so we would duty street action we would set up like an ... in the middle of town square\nQuestions about Islam\nLots of joy just about on the road the joy\nReplied them with pastries so that they can feel like hey someone who's going to give me pastries doesn't have it out for me what would people get tough\nOh my gosh they could ask literally anything why do some Muslim\nBank and you can identify that's\nA really good question you know so we got a question like that all over the country um you know because I don't know where that job and I don't you know cover so you know so like people could ask those questions I don't\nI'm another question that was frequent was\nWhy don't Muslim denounce terrorism and why\nWe got that everywhere and I continue to get that and my travels all over the country why don't Muslims denounced terrorism and so there's like a huge PR miss\nGap that happened and where Americans think that must have felt that there is and I don't know how this happened because literally every Muslim I Know does\nSo I'm like did we not tweeted out at the data that\nWhen we come back you first saw it explains why it's important in social justice comedy to keep it delightful show today

justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required little patient [laughter]\nAnd so I was super outgoing um easy to talk to someone who was really you know inclined to make jokes and it was really just this continual way of almost saying to myself I'm OK\nI'm All right you know and it was almost this way of trying to convince myself that things weren't as desperate as they really are\n... and then I Would go into my room [noise] late at night and I would have thought of you know ending my life [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills\nWith a pen and paper in my hand I thought about taking my own life and I came to this close to doing it\nAgain this close to doing it and I didn't\nSo that makes me one of the lucky ones one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump\nOne of the lucky ones Who Survives fly survived and that just lives with my story and my story is this\nFor simple words I suffer from depression\nUnfortunately we live in a world where if you break your arm everyone runs over to sign your cast\nBut if you tell people you're depressed everyone runs the other way that the stigma\n\nMeantime as you were experiencing some of this you were trying to like lunch your career as a standup\nComic yeah in the absolute mecca of show business and Victoria, BC Canada yeah totally so well like well struggling with crippling depression you were trying to funny to um like people in comedy houses\nOh gosh yeah I Know it's just so cliche so many ways but yeah [laughter] yeah I Know exactly I\nYou know look I think this is part of it too right is there's this big idea that kind of says you know everyone in who does comedy or anyone is a comedian is the sort of sad clown and you know they have all these issues and you know and sometimes I Do feel a little bit stereotypical kind of living in to that idea\nBut for me you just got to think about it this way which is that when I was really recovering during that time might constant sense of\nFeeling better was watching comedy I was obsessed or you\nAre you comfortable like\nJoking about depression and mental illness or is there like a ... as in like a party like draw a line at it I'm\nIt's difficult because I Would never want to make a joke that would seem as though it's demeaning those experiences but one of the most interesting things as we kind of put up these walls in our mind around certain topics right and we go we can't laugh at that that's not funny\nAnd when you were saying that what do you really sad\nLike that's too serious to laugh at that is too important to laugh at and I really thought about that question for a long time and the ...\nBut that's one of the best ways into these conversations [laughter]\nWe all know what it is to hurt [noise]\nWe all know what it is a pain in our heart and we all know how important it is to heal right now depression is society's deep cuts to working tend to put a band aid over pretend it's not their relatives there\nIt is there and you know what it's OK depression is okay if you're going through I Know that you're okay I Know that you're ...\nYou're not week and it's an issue not an identity because when you get past the fear and the ridicule in the judgment and the stigma of others you can see depression for what it really is [noise] and that's just a part of life [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I mean it's almost like that pain is a source of mature like it's like it's like you have to have that pain to to have something to be funny\nYeah and I think in my perspective on that\nWould be not even just to have something to be funny about to know why it even matters to be happy to look at it pass just oh that's you know a good laugh and just see what that really means to someone on a spiritual or emotional level and I think that we live in this world now that is so\nSerious in so many ways and we're so plugged into our technology and we're so plugged into these external realities that feel like they're constantly you kind of knocking on the door of our mind and just begging for our attention\nAnd to laugh is to find yourself back in the moment to laugh has to be free and so many ways\nAnd so for myself that's just something that I think about all the time and I try and bring into my work is just that's what I'm really here to do if I'm here to serve someone that's the way I'm serving them and that's what it means the most to me\nI had this moment when I was Seventeen years old I can remember this so clearly\nWhere I was really asking myself this question of am I going to pursue this you know is this gonna be the path that I follow and I one day thought I went what's the definition of laughing\nBecause I don't even know when I when I looked it up in the dictionary and it said the definition of laughter is the tangible evidence of how [noise]\nAnd to me that changed my whole life because I'd just sweat yes like that's what comedy gave me it was this tangible sense of hope this not just an escape from my problems but it's completely different reality in which I Would be so overwhelmed with the present moment with laughter that I couldn't even remember what\nThis struggle that I was experiencing on the day to day was\nAnd that changed everything for

I think that one would see that as terrorism if it has a political intent to the reason I'm emphasizing that is of course a little bit more than a year ago\nA shooter at the Las Vegas hotel open fire on concert goers and killed nearly sixty people that has they've terrorize people may have caused profound fear and anxiety in the United states amongst people who gather\nThe public venues that because of the firearms laws in this country that they could be\nVictims of such attacks but we still year later do not know the motive for the intention of the shooter and that's why that has never be labeled terrorism\nAt first I Want to stop you right there we will never know the motive and I think that's what's most frustrating for a lot of people when we often don't know the motives for example of um international terrorists right are we we can assume that they're just anti American is something that I think comes up often in conversation but\nWe won't know the motive of the Las Vegas shooter because that person is no longer here when these folks take their own lives when they commit violent acts in public why is that not considered a terrorist attack\nOr but even people who perished in the course of their attacker commit suicide immediately afterwards\nOn occasion have can text for laws that have put it in the context of some political cause or of allegiance to or belief in support of the ideology of movement and an instance where we just have someone randomly open fire without putting it in that context\nAnd the legal context that can't be terrorists but you're absolutely right in the normative sense what society regards as terrorism is something obviously very very different\nBut your point about lone wolves absolutely is regarded as a terrorist act it is seen as a deliberate strategy of terrorist organizations\nTo radicalize to inspire to motivate and ultimately animate lone individuals to carry out acts of violence on their behalf I don't think there's much doubt that that's terrorism which is so important in this context\nIs that entire lone wolf concept was developed over Thirty years ago by white supremacist in the United states as a means to push back against the success that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies were happy to basically shutting down they're much more organized and overtly conspiratorial activities\nAnd it was a former Texas grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan Lewis being who came up with this idea of lone wolf for leader this resistance type terrorists that unfortunately we see played out across the country today\nBread love to hear your thoughts on this on the sort of the lone wolf attacks but also the idea that there are whites being radicalized in the United states and the limits of how we call that terrorism or not\nYeah certainly I think that the frustration for civil rights activists like myself and and that you see expressed from many of the communities that are most vulnerable most often subject to attack from white supremacist is not simply with whether or not we are labeling\nUm these acts of violence terrorism but whether or not we are and knowledge in white supremacy as a political ideology\nThis was something that we debated back in two thousand Fifteen when Dylann Roof\nEntered a mother Emanuel and shot and killed nine black parishioners there in Charleston and there was a similar kind of debate well is it terrorism well we don't know but his motive is\nTo murder people of color because you believe that the United states should be white nation is a political motive is it is eight and explicitly\nPolitical motive again it is we can't talk about how people are being radicalized without having an honest conversation about white supremacy as an ideology as a long standing political ideology and struggle in this nation this is a nation that\nOver a hundred and fifty years ago had a civil war over the issue of slavery over the issue of whether or not black Americans could be counted as people could be counted as citizens in the aftermath of the civil war we had the period every construction which I think is arguably\nVery similar to the political conditions that we are seeing today you have a higher level of participation from people of color in electoral system in response to that you had a white supremacist backlash that in most recent years has been kind of on signified or symbolized\nBy the political ascendancy Donald Trump in this movement of a make America great again\nItself kind of implies this return to a prior period will now\nPeople like myself I Know that in prior periods of the United states we were not allowed to be citizens so to not acknowledge that this this racism that we're seeing that this violence that we're seeing is inherently political it's not simply\nCannot simply be boiled down to an issue of hate and someone feeling personal animosity towards um someone else you know and it makes sense\nThat white supremacist groups particularly in the seventies and the FBI was starting to kind of crack down on them would try to steer us more towards the narrative of\nThere being these lone wolf actors but the reality is is that white supremacist groups are organized you have extremists white supremacist group and you also have white supremacist ideology\nIn the mainstream and that is part of the conflict that we have been discussing this week in terms of what role or what influence right does a Trump ism have on normalizing this kind of hate and that kind of political ideology and not simply hate it isn't that a political ideology\nBruce Hoffman and renewed ... stay with us for a second we're going to continue this conversation on this thing going\nOn for the jig when it comes from ... European made language learning program that will teachers practical conversation and Spanish French German language is a boy in the app store or online at ... dot com\n[noise]\nOn the next for can connect will have the latest poll numbers from you went out on Florida's governor hands Senate races I'm Melissa Ross and probably been with first connect sponsored by Baptist Health and north Florida ... pm Tuesday at nine AM on eighty nine nine of Jaycee taste [noise]\n\n\n[noise] houses of worship are facing their worst fears get again the pastor of America's biggest Methodist Church says he wants to bridge cultural divide and help the faithful through the troubles of the world where more churches nominations\nOffices adult pastor Adam Hamilton on\nHow his mega church meets these typical home as much time on\nWeekdays at eleven on eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. [noise]\nBoth ... is also the favored name for men and for a higher income Brazilians\nNow he's also has a a history of saying very disturbing things up particularly against women um can you give us a sense of where he stands there [noise]\nYeah he had to make a huge turn because there's a lot of resistance among women during the campaign women took the street protests a lot on the streets on end and social media and there was a sense in the beginning that they would prevent\nHim from winning because he has been birds as respectful to women so he had to try to change the way talk and to outline that he has a daughter that use a family man\nIn order to gain this vote and apparently he succeeded because in the last weeks he's grown according to the polls ... was among women as well so the women's support was all over the size of for his victory for says Dr\nI'm struck by the women's support for both for NATO given his past comments it feels very much like what we saw happen in the twenty sixteen election here in the United states uh with the President Trump where a certain percentage particularly of white women supporters\nVoted for the president or hear how much did race factor into these elections\nRace is a crucial factor here you see according to the surveys that among\nBlack people will ... is not so wild voted he has a much better performance for whites men and white women and as you mentioned Trump a similar a phenomena happen here\nBecause both an auto had many outrageous statements and disrespectful comments regarding women and regard and that\nBlack people but none of them were enough to reduce who support among women\nThan one more question for you about the ecological impact that this president's he could have we know that Brazil holes sixty percent of the Amazon rain forest also NATO has a promise to roll back protections for the rain forest tell us what a environmentalist or thinking about that proposal\nThis is a major concern because his minister for agriculture and environment is a tycoon from Brazil and agribusiness they have a old police said that they want to increase\nIllegal deforestation so does this something that environmental is sort of are located with a with a major concern and that's for sure is going to be a battle that the the next president will face in his first term\nMoney amongst the Bruno is a reporter with the Brazilian report in Rio de Janeiro do thank you\nThank you very much for having me [noise]\n\n\nA former Monsanto executive is being tapped to run the fish and Wildlife Service within the department of the interior\nLast week President Trump nominated or rarely a skip with as director if confirmed she'll have discretion over the enforcement of federal wildlife laws protection of endangered species and conservation and restoration of wildlife habitats skipped with spent six years with the agro chemical giant before joining the Interior Department in twenty Seventeen\nEmily hold in as an environment reporter for the guardian Emily thanks for joining us thank you for having me silt who can you give us a little more on who exactly are really a skip with is I'm specifically interested in the time that she spent with Monsanto and what her role but they're\nShort so she's been deputy assistant secretary for a fish wildlife and parks at the Interior Department since April twenty Seventeen which essentially means that she's been working with the fish and Wildlife Service and the national Park Service\nBut for six years until two thousand twelve she was in research at Monsanto and she let a team that brought new agricultural products to market and after that she was in corporate affairs and then first time after that she and turn it the agriculture department and was a consultant for a U.S ID\nNow she's uh she's been with the Interior Department for more than a year what is her role currently and what happened so far under her tenure there\nShe's been working with fish fish and wildlife services and the national Park Service and what you've seen interior do in that area is basically weaken protections for at risk cc's so\nFor for those that are at risk not automatically giving the same protections to threatened species as he would for endangered when uh they've also allows more incidental killings of migratory birds by industry or they have shrunk um national monuments like Bears Ears and Utah and they've been making it easier for oil and gas drilling on public land\nIt feels like many of the president's appointees to a lot of hit a these are departments I'm almost feels like these are folks who either represent private interests in and almost the antithesis of what these departments are supposed to do is that the case here would skip with\nWell your work history certainly doesn't suggest experience and conservation or CC's protection the main things that she would really be focusing on\nAnd we do know that other people from Monsanto work in the federal government mainly at the agriculture department but I didn't hear hear a lot of people that we see in charge have represented the oil and gas industry and the coal industry and essentially the Trump Administration has said that because they feel that those industries were under represented previously and they went to do everything they can to boost energy production\nAnd I also want to touch very briefly on the fact that Monsanto did have its own legal troubles recently a judge refused the company's appeal to overturn the verdict um but the verdict did find that the Monsanto weed killer causes cancer so\nIs there I'm Wondering if there's been a updates in that case or whether or not that's of concern to folks about skip with her relationship with Monsanto\nI think the last update there with a judge actually lowered the amount that Monsanto was required to pay the person who had a cancer cancer aground keep her for a school in California um and\nI think the bigger concern is um or related to ah the pesticides that Monsanto also works on so a little more in her wheel house at the Interior Department rescinded\nStandard that you can't use a pesticide that is linked with a lot of beat at in conjunction with ... genetically modified crops are National Wildlife refuge has said something that she has as likely been a bit more involved with um and there are\nA lot of other decisions that she would be making that probably would be of great interest to her former employer\nAnd I'm Wondering what the overall response has been and are we clear in any direction she might take as she leads this uh this department\nI think she would largely be doing what interior has been doing previously which is making a lot of their policies more friendly to industry and how they're operating on these a public plan for with national monuments and park so she'll be focus more on on fish and wildlife in this position\nEmily hold and as the climate and environment reporter for the guardian Emily thanks so much\nWe want you to be part of the take away from listener response network will send you a few text messages a week about

Boston\nWhat American voters head to the polls next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle\nThe winners of the midterms have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map that happens every ten years and it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level here\nTo explain more is Denise Ross barber she is the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise
