country in the end of the infants\n[noise] [noise]\nDuring our first meeting Carmen talk a lot about how bad the economy was and how many doctors were leaving the island to practice on the mainland still Puerto Rico was ahead of many places when it came to ... all pregnant women retested and for babies who were born with the virus the government set up a system to track them for\nThree years and

thinking about the again\n\nAfter that first call I checked in with Carmen at least once a month and on each call she told me the same thing there was no word from the government about restarting seek a testing for pregnant women\n\nSo in the spring of two thousand Eighteen six months after the hurricane I went back\nTo Puerto Rico to find out what was going on\nThere was no see that this thing\nEver done seen September to his house and seventeenth seem to hear it so we have no way of knowing if we are still having jazz nation are not\nDoctors could still draw blood to testify ... but there wasn't much point to it that's because they were being told the government health lab that performs the test was closed for business\nNot only that this is when officials announced that the crisis was over that there were no new cases of ... on the island it was like we could have been swept away by the hurricane\nThe website of they have seen by many which by the way it's no longer there I said yesterday they do have said by main website to see whether they had any seek us that this is nothing they have nothing there now it's only they all reports\nCarmen couldn't believe it the government was saying there were no new cases of the ... after the hurricane but Fifteen hundred pregnant women had been diagnosed earlier that same year\nDr she works with couldn't believe it either

are being infected\nBefore the storm Cynthia spent a year traveling to government health centers around the island gathering data ... babies after they were born the ones that government is following for three years do you feel like they're\nGonna have to file you\nOh boy a good one [noise]\nUh this point the program that I was part of monitoring the development of children\nBorn to\nSeek I expose pregnancies within the department of health we have been stopped\nCynthia tells me the government fired her and took all of the data shade collected\nShe says they didn't give her a reason for letting her go\nAnd health department would tell us\nEither after Cynthia stops working for the government she teamed up with Dr ... and they're monitoring children on their own allowing Cynthia is focusing on babies who were exposed to Zika\nMoran looking completely normal babies like Kimberly hanging\nOut okay you're emphasizing the articles I oh yeah right so what we're doing here is the baby scale so painful development\nKimberly a seven month old and because today is actually her seven month birthday her grandmother adults are up in a fancy dress and a headband with one giant boat that seems to say I don't have hair but I Am a girl\nSaving\n\nLooks like a kid herself exaggerating her expressions and practically climbing on to the table it looks like she and Kimberly are playing but everything Kimberly does how she reaches for the rental how she holds it the way she tries to squirm off the table it's all a test trying to answer one question\nIs she able to do what's expected of a seven month old now for the most part yes but\nBut I noticed that you know there was a little ... here in terms of self regulation is what I Do notice so far\nAs even in Monterey Bay to a series you've asked what is you know yeah\nThere's a very wide range some kids are doing really well and some kids are very compromised I'm noticing a lot of small motor delays moving your hands\nThe lay ceding the lay walking\nThese kinds of exams are crucial because if a doctor notices that have babies motor skills aren't developing the way they should they can start therapies to help the baby\nStudies like this also help researchers understand how legal works yes they can cause massive problems like microcephaly but it can also cause more subtle neurological issues trouble swallowing walking seeing\nMaybe that might that there hasn't been that many studies on this kid and the samples right now thinks that same publisher thirty kids you know for the kids can and we have two hundred we have over two hundred\nSo that's why we think this data is really important to publish but\nIt's not clear if this study will ever see the light of day the health department needs to authorize publication and so far it's refused to do so\nI told him that I've made in that we had I said I Can't believe you're being completely unethical so who were you talking to when you said your officials from the department of health that were in charge of this seek a monitoring system have now I I've never seen politics getting involved\nOn on research\nThe way that this looks like [noise]\nMm [noise]\nI've wanted to understand the politics behind the ... ever since I started following it two years ago and I did everything I could think of to talk to someone from the health department\n[noise] [noise] I mean\nI was at work I showed up at their offices again and again I mean the problem is\nI've been to the office many times now in person and also called\nCertain things finally I tracked down the assistant secretary of health Dr Concepcion can notice long ago\nWe meet in the hallway of the convention center where she's speaking at a press conference about a new lunch program and just like the doctor said she's quick to give me the government's official lying on the ... the crisis is over\nSo far we are not that they think Neal cases\nAh the guy on our faith epidemiology they'll son expect to have cases right now\nThere is also a sign that says el Olin word of delivering\nShe's a pastor and a real estate agent [noise]\nWhen I Walk inside hemp taking a phone call from a client [noise] good morning there than to help you\nHer desk is covered and paper and folders and posted notes walking clients are constantly coming in and out and as soon as she gets off the phone just rang again [noise]\n\nBut more to say and they help you\nAs the climate talks on the phone hands scribbles on a yellow legal pad\nOkay when can you are coming in to do that patients what are you\nHearing so nine PM\nI hadn't been off as hard as they see when his place\nAnd so you know because they're not talking about a new they more\nEnemy is still going on\nHands than hearing from a lot of flood victims and besides wanting a place that won't flood again\nPretty much everyone who called or drops in has one request [noise]\nYou know I'm trying to be in that area for myself for my kids or something like\nI Want to have a greater labor like you're going to go you're\nOne of those clients is a woman named Denise Taylor she's from Chicago and she reached out to him on line just a couple of months before the hurricane when she was thinking about leaving\nDenise did not feel safe and her old neighborhood\nAnd she wanted her daughter Christina to go to a better school\nTo meet kids from all kinds of backgrounds\nOn the west side of Chicago is just African Americans and Hispanics [noise]\nThat's it and I try to find that it's not normal for normal for where can I take her\nTo really see it like most of ... clients Denise have something that's supposed to help her get what she's looking for what's called a housing choice voucher also known as the section eight voucher government benefits that helps low income people pay rent [noise]\nAbout twenty thousand families in Houston area use these vouchers the program was designed to be this ticket to a better neighborhood maybe a better life it's federal money you can use the voucher anywhere in the country\nOn the last day of July in twenty Seventeen Denise and Christie and I got into their fourth focus hatchback and drove from Chicago to Houston they hardly knew anyone there except ...\nSo I said when you come down you can stay with me why you decided\nSome of the world's going to do that I Know about it she could've been a killer but again you don't say a little more ... than anything I got here you can head as close as a pogo with close enough to be a key my first day I was gone I woke up\nAnd I was like she just got bucks here and there was a key to stay at home it didn't take long for Denise to find a job at a pharmaceutical plant packing and shipping\nBut just a few weeks after she moved in with Pam Harvey hit and then he says housing search suddenly got way tougher\nHarvey damage to more than forty percent excuse in houses and apartment buildings\nThere was a lot more competition for what was left and the vouchers expired in as little as two months if you don't find a place in time so she hit the phones [noise]\nMy name is ... I was calling a reference to your apartments you have ...\nThe nieces voucher would let her rent a two bedroom apartment costing up to fourteen hundred dollars a month with the government paying maybe half of that she found plenty of apartments within that price range and neighborhoods she liked\nAnd my next question is do you guys take the housing choice voucher so you do or you don't at all okay that's okay thank you [noise]\nDenise made dozens of calls like this everyone said no a month after Harvey hit then two months Denise was still staying with him and apartment manager's we're still telling her no\nIn some parts of the u._s. it's illegal to reject or rent or just because they have a voucher it's considered discrimination that's not true in Texas though which all explain more later\nIf if the grading and if you're not morally if you're not built up morally it can really puts you on a you know the press\nKind of face I Am I you know and it makes you put yourself in a category that you're not in\nOne out of every four families in Houston that receives a voucher never gets to use it that's according to the Houston housing authority Denise was worried she'd have to give her back\nWhy don't you say fixing it what's wrong with sex right\nDenise thinks this isn't about her voucher she thinks it's because she's black like most voucher holders we ran the numbers and found that almost Ninety percent of families and the Houston area without trees are African American most of them live in areas with the city's highest poverty rate\nThe way that he sees it she's deliberately being steered toward the poorest and most racially segregated neighborhoods [noise]\nLocal housing officials recognize that this is a problem and ... is actually one of the most\nSegregated cities in the country\nA few years ago the Houston housing authority tried to take a small step to address the issue it didn't go well\n\nOfficials had this idea to build a mixed income apartment building in a wealthier part of town called the Galleria it's known to this giant glitzy mall with an ice skating rink\nSome of the units in the building would have to accept vouchers getting poorer families access to better schools\nBut hundreds of angry he's donations revolted\nAnd here's a little frog [noise]\n\nBack in twenty sixteen they showed up in force to a public meeting at the neighborhood elementary school it was standing room only lasted for hours [noise] almost all the people in the crowd were white they complained that the building was too expensive way overcrowded schools lower property values\n\n\nOr our wonderful but you have\nTo follow him\nPeoples and written comments to one person complained about what they called pollution of upscale neighborhoods with the poor\nOnly a few people spoke up in favor of the proposal including a woman named ...\nOf the really really fear\n... black and she works for a housing advocacy group\nShe told the audience the people who want to live here are your janitors\nEvery says your wait staff\nSo we want to say why\nDid I put in your [noise]\n\nWhen this whole debate was going on Pamela banks was watching it unfold and thinking about our clients these apartments could have helped them\nIf they could move that neighborhood with a voucher they could get a leg up but the project was killed not long after that public hearing I called him recently and played or some of the tape the part where the guy talks about compassion for people who need affordable housing but also that poison grapes Penn told\nMe it made her think about how after the hurricane people set up animal shelters on that side of town\nIn the gallery ...\nFor\nYou and your name is\nThere's a reason pan is saying we and us here for her it's personal in her late twenties after she and her husband separated him landed in Houston as a single mom she applied for a section ... voucher and waited for seven years to get one\nWhen she finally got her voucher back in Nineteen Ninety seven Pam spent months searching for a place that would take it one day she came across this lifting the brick house with a fireplace in the suburbs and an area known for better schools so she drove out there to meet the landlord\nIt was raining I got out there and it was the youngest and America later they were going to be ... she got out toward the house\nPam knew her odds had just gone down and was tempted to turn back but she decided to wait for the woman with a fancy car to leave she went to the door and introduce yourself to the landlord\nSaid okay you said and I have housing and I know you may or may not know about housing type image but take this on for about it and let me know if you want to work with me\nThe guy said okay you can rent this house and five years after ... and the kids move than she bought her own house [noise]\nThis is why Pam does this work today and why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey [noise]\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they banned any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers\nAnd they can't be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen\nIndiana did to the same year\nThe needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter the
