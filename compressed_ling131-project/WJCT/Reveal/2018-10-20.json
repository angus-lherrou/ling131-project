who's been defending voting rights for decades I wrote it if you want to shoot out of the OK Corral you came to the right place on this episode was election shootout and George Burns [noise]\nThis is a video called vote Gangnam Style Helens group made it and it shows people signing up to vote outside of Asian grocery stores in Atlanta suburbs at one point a group of dancing teenagers is joined by congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis Helen says her group signed up more than Fifteen hundred\nPeople but there was a problem hundreds of them weren't showing up on the voter registration list she contacted secretary of state Brian Kemp office but Helen didn't get any answers so she went public and got a swift rebuke from camp can you walk me back to exactly when you receive that letter from the secretary of state's office\nI'm sure I read it and I got scared you know um and then test\nCan split or claimed some of the applications for late or didn't come in at all and he turned the tables he suggested Helen May have broken the law by photo copying the applications and keeping costs\nHe's in Georgia that could lead to a felony charges so Helen turn to a prominent Atlanta attorney Emmett Joplin bond during the second\nThe vast number of ordinary people\nAre easily intimidated by\nExactly that sort of letter\nMr pondering is eighty one he's a successful corporate lawyer and also something of a voting rights legit\nWay back in Nineteen sixty three he won his first case before the Supreme Court increasing the power of black voters in Atlanta after Helen asked for his help ... wrote a letter to the secretary of state letting him know he'd be representing Helen and her organization\nAnd if you got any questions about their activities you directly to me\nYou want to shoot at the OK Corral you came to the right place\nAnd you better think about that\nComes off as backed off and didn't file any charges but he's investigated other voting rights groups including one founded by his political opponents Stacey Abrams Kemp says he's just making it harder to cheat Banderas and called these investigations part of a broader playbook used by Republicans to suppress the vote [noise]\nSo what happened to Helen came home when I asked her she told me that two years later she went back to check on the people who are group tried to register half still weren't on the roads and then we try to\nFollow the banks have on the farm and many of them are no longer interested in\nWorking let that are going back out because they thought they'd been turned off so badly\nTheir problem Helen Kimmo faced hasn't gone away\nEarlier this month voting rights groups filed a lawsuit claims Brian ... office has violated the voting rights act and the constitution\nAnd issue is a law that freezes applications name or other info doesn't exactly match other government records even if it's just missing a hype and the people can still vote but activists worried they might be discouraged by the confusion\nAnd ... says there's another voter suppression strategy that still has him stumped it first dawned on him in twenty twelve\nYou're reading an article that the number of registered voters in Georgia had gone down\nThis raise serious questions because\nWe knew Georgia's population was growing you knew\nThere had not been the black death to kill off\nA third of the space\nAbout population\nWe had to be something else going on\nSo here's what's happening to\nBond earns missing voters states routinely purge hundreds of thousands of people from their voter registration rolls these are people who've died or moved away or gone to prison but Georgia and at least eight other states have what you could call it use it or lose it laws not voting can get you removed from the rolls\nWorks like this if you sit out a couple of elections you can get put on an inactive list the state sends you a mailer if you don't respond and get to more federal elections your perch and if you don't know your removed you may show up at your polling place only to find out you can't vote\nUnder camp there's been a massive jumped in purchase\nOn hair brown camps that job is to protect our vote and this is an ad from power pack Georgia its donors promised ten million dollars to boost Stacey Abrams campaign we just can't trust that Brian camp [noise]\nCan stand on a bus tour around the state talking about his record I went to a stop south of Atlanta outside spray very barbecue restaurant just regular campaign stop for Georgia Republicans\n... steps off the bus and gives his stump speech it's all about putting Georgia first and protecting its values then he gets back on the bus\nI get onto I asked him about the allegations that he'd been aggressively purging voters he looks a little irritated\nWell I Would disagree with that statement what we're doing is within the law and required by law\nSo your office hasn't been more aggressive than others in the past in terms of removing voters from the rolls\nNo I don't believe we have I mean we're just going through the process but you know having secure lessons you gotta obscure voter rolls\nKemp says he's made it easier to vote by setting up online registration but during his time in office there's been a big jump in the number of people who've been removed from the rolls more than one point six million have had their registration cancelled [noise]\nI decided to try and find people who've been purged without knowing it in Moultrie the small agricultural town in southern Georgia\nThere's some kind of science over there\nWith Angela ... she's an investigative reporter for a PM reporters and\nWe've got to sort of guide a database with the names and addresses of all five hundred thousand or so people purged in Georgia last year and our analysis shows that in the county where Moultrie is any more than two dozen others the perjury is are disproportionately affecting people of color [noise]\n\nMostly the county seat we pass white column homes with manicured lawns and lush magnolias in front on the other side of town we drive over potholes streets long rows of one story ramshackle houses [noise]\nWhen we get to the homes of people who are listed is perhaps some are boarded up and the residents had moved away at some of the other addresses we're told the people were looking for have gone off to college or the military as\nI Am this woman tells us she doesn't vote for religious reasons\nBeer and you\nWe're still looking for someone who wants to vote in November but doesn't know they've been purged so we go to seek Cornelius ponder a member of Moultrie city council but he's also a businessman and pastor at the real church that stands for restoration and if ... and love\nHe says his family's lived in the area for generations\nMy great grandparents uh it was small sharecroppers\nReverend ponder won his election last year by the slimmest of margins just nine votes he says while he was campaigning he encountered people who'd been purged for failing to vote in previous elections\nI came across all quite a few people in election Iranian some of them went down to vote and they could and then uh I had to be said that they got down there and they didn't have proper documentation ended on this confusing like that during the ...\nHe says with Trump in office enthusiasm is low in Moultrie in the last election voter turnout was below ten percent voters are also frustrated with all the obstacles purges confusion over polling locations and long lines\nThe racist failing like is no longer more to vote in there and I think that's what we're we're we're trouble with\nThen Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nHey why there\nOh yeah yeah they didn't even worse\nShe's not\nSteve record say Kathleen ponder registered to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year officials struck her name from the rolls river and ponder tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does he is and know that she's been taken off the voting list [noise]\nAngela and I find ms ponder living in a small house just outside Moultrie why\nOut I mean I can say that I'm a reporter with radio hey there John\nSorry about people who than removed from the last I don't know if you've heard of that day St\nAngelo explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rolls at a disproportionate rates\nYou registered to vote in two thousand and eight\nYears and very that Obama is saying do you remember\nNo divorce making\nThen a last July you were taken off the voter lay a salad event on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen hands but you didn't get any notification that you'd\nHave news this you know\nDid you know that there is a policy that they take us if you don't\nMiss ponder tells us she had no idea she'd been purged although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for Governor Rhodes will be back at Reverend ponders office Angela gives him the news about his aunt\n[noise] uh no I Would not counted as hacking know what was it then\nIt was it was browsing the Web site\nSo at this point he sits down and compose an email to the people I Kennesaw state\nHe says look I'm a local cyber security researcher I don't want to make a big deal out of this but you should probably know that I turned up all this scary stuff\nHe doesn't hear back right away so he gets the cell phone number from rural king the guy in charge of chaos you get some on the phone but the more they talk living says the weirder things get\nHe said that I should probably stop a doing this or to work otherwise people downtown would crush me what did he mean by that at the time I took that to mean a politician's right\nAnd I also took that as more of a warning that a threat\nBut in hindsight I'm not really sure\nLogan didn't get crushed by politicians or anyone else though the FBI did pay a visit a few months later now he's sitting at the center of a messy situation one that says a lot about the state of election security in Georgia and across the country\nAbout a month after Logan first finds the problem Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp is in Washington DC\nI Want to thank the committee and chairman her for invited me to discuss election security\nHe's testifying before a house subcommittee on information technology and over the past few weeks he's been boasting about the security of Georgia's system he's also been calling out the federal government for overstepping its election responsibilities and trying to quote subvert the constitution under the guise of security\nBy the way kept doesn't know about Logan findings yet and that the hearing he's going off again\nSure he says the heck on the DNC was troubling but\nThe D.C response to these attacks has been to take steps toward federalizing aspects of the ... election systems in standardizing security measures there is a better\nWay to hearing goes on for hours eventually Kemp starts getting pushback from Jerry Connelly a democratic senator from Virginia\nMr Kemp hum I Want to make sure I understood your testimony commonly skeptical he basically says so you're telling us that there's never an election situation that calls for any kind of federal intervention effort on campus like no not really getting Connelly doesn't buy it\nWhat about the voting rights act he says states were actively disenfranchising people then the government stepped in isn't that positive\nKemp doesn't seem to understand the question I\nWould say that the voting rights act is still intact\nYes but it's an example of the opposite of what you were asserting it was an example of federalizing something to protect the franchise I don't believe in ... states weren't doing it in fact states were actively suppressing votes you don't deny that do\nWell I'm not sure I understand what that has to do with the election system\nWhile I'm dealing with your assertion of the principles that we shouldn't federalize any aspect of this and I'm arguing that the voting rights act is it clear exception to your principal and that\nThe federal government in federal elections at least has some interest that overrides state interest when it comes to protecting at the cyber level the integrity of the results\nWill certainly your opinion mine differs\n[noise] are you back much Germany\nAt the end of the hearing campus given one last chance to speak any stance from states have this cyber security stuff handled he says and in fact maybe federal officials should pay us visit maybe they would learn a few things\nI think there'll be very pleasantly surprised [laughter]\nThe team in Kennesaw state was certainly surprised in fact slogans email sent him scrambling they didn't want to be interviewed for this story but all their emails for public record which means you can get them if you ask nicely\nLet's start on August twenty eight twenty sixteen Logan emails K su he tell somebody found and he says quote there's a strong probability your site is already compromise members of chaos youth center for election system starts circulating the email around\nAnd over the next few days they start to realize\nThe school's information security team recommends doing some scans but then the director of the elections team weights and\nHe says wait a minute wait a minute this is our busiest time of year the last thing we want is for the site to become unavailable all these counties Nita\nReading this at first it's easy to think okay that makes sense but this idea that you can't make elections secure because you're so busy preparing for the elections the scenes problematic by September fifteenth these scans still haven't been done\nSomeone from the elections team says they're struggling with the technology quote we discover we're a little out of our debt\nThe elections team gets the breach fix or so they think it's October twenty seven two months after Logan first emailed them\nThey think the security team and said quote this has been a huge help to us reading this email you can basically here this deep sigh of relief like\nExcept it's not\nYou might be wondering what Brian Kemp has to say about all this\nWell despite Logan land downloading dreams a sensitive information which kept called deeply concerning Kim also said that Georgia is protected with layers upon layers of security\nAnd specifically he's made two arguments\nNumber one the voting machines are never connected to the Internet which makes them safer from hacking\nAnd number two breaking into just one wouldn't really do much you'd need a wide scale conspiracy actually mess with an election [noise]\nSo there's a good reason to push back on both of those arguments will lose arguments wrong\nRichton Milo is a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech he used to be the chief technology officer at Hewlett Packard\nYou don't need to mount an attack on thousands and thousands of polling places you just need to have a really good idea a word to target your tax in order to flip the right number of votes in order to get above with racial\nPlus he says because Georgia system is so centralized\nThere are multiple points of entry for an attacker that's part of what Logan discovery proved not only did Georgia leave itself exposed the people running things didn't even seem to understand how bad the problem was or what was at stake\nThere making it up they're scared to death they're making it up on a day to day basis they have no idea what's going on in these systems they have no idea why they work or don't work and they're kind of living in constant fear that this whole thing is going to come crashing down around years\nThey also failed to realize something else something really important five months after Logan made his initial discovery he was hanging out with a friend another cyber security guy\nThat was like Cristo ever tell you about that wacky stuff I found that case you know he said no tell me more\n[laughter] they sit down at a computer and download everything again except this time there's more because it looks like new info has been added since January so we're able to get the exact same amount of stuff\nThe second time or effectively yeah so nothing had changed well they had a tempted to fix it but in such a way that I I actually don't understand what they were trying to do [laughter] okay [laughter]\nThose those about my reaction\nI don't really understand [noise]\nKim didn't want to talk for this story but I was able to chat with Kathy Cox Georgia secretary of state from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand seven a Democrat she oversaw the state wide roll out of touch screen machines in the early two thousand and unlike every cyber security expert I've ever talked to she's critical of paper ballots\nFrom dead people voting to ballot boxes are showing up in the bottom of a lake or they're just so many opportunities\nLimited truly only by one to manage a nation to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even the Logan findings were troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly that burned heart is a PHD student at\nThe University of Michigan he studies theories and they're vulnerable\nNot says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you're injecting permission or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of the tree the way it's set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data a second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta it was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom on the other side where ...
