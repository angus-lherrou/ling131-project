since embrace does a horror classic spirit has haunted the dreams of many moviegoers none more so than look look what I mean oh who has spent more than Thirty years trying to remake it\nYou can understand why the director of such viscerally erotic romances as call me by your name and I am love would respond as a ... a force lush stylistic possibilities alone\nSo it's surprising that this new movie departs from the original in every way imaginable the visual palate is cold and gray water you know has drained away the rights lurid colors and most of the shocks and crowded the story with historical detail\nAt two and a half hours this ... runs a full hour longer than the original and it takes its time creeping into your veins but creep it does the movie is a hoot and the folly but it's also a marvel magnificently obsessive vision that comes to feel less like a remake than a rebirth\nIt's Nineteen Seventy seven year of the deadly German Autumn and the still divided city of Berlin is reeling from the violent acts of the radical Red Army faction also known as the butter mine off gang\nInto this chaos comes Suzie banyan a strikingly self possessed young woman from Ohio who is just joined the prestigious Helena Marcos dance company\nSuzie is played by Dakota Johnson who starred in the fifty shades of gray trilogy and his bus no stranger to subjecting herself to extreme physical exertion it's\nThe company's specializes in a form of modern dance notable for its forceful aggressive choreography which expresses an bodies the traumas of Germany's war torn past and present\nThe director Matt I'm block is played by Tilda Swinton an actress with natural sorcery and her veins she begins preparing Suzie for the lead role in the upcoming piece working especially on her jumps but ... is also clearly grooming her for a darker purpose\nWhen you got it down for you make your money and they create\nAnd how can we do yeah\nYeah\nYeah they kind of I mean you have to

form of witchcraft\nAny doubts will be laid to rest early on by a hideously gruesome set piece in which Suzie dances a solo unaware that her body has been magically couldn't joined to that of a dancer and another room\nAs soon as he dances the other woman is mercilessly tossed about her bones cracking as her limbs twist like a pretzel\nSuch grizzly moments aside it's almost perverse how little the spirit traffics in overt scares why don't you know in his screen writer David ... generate plenty of unease but they seem disinclined to build suspense\nAt times the movie draws you right into the witches inner circle as if it were trying to get you on their side these which is maybe wicked luring young women into their ranks and punishing those who disappoint them but are they more evil the horrors of war\nCould the dance academy perhaps be stronghold against those horrors in all female enclave passing down it's dark arts from generation to generation in an effort to ward off an even

overseeing elections allegations suppression\nThere are people on the left literally have called me the secretary of suppression\nThey don't walk in with the voter rolls point\nKemp set of threatening letters Helen to go after she registered minority folks\nLike scared you know um and then tests\nSo she turned to an Atlanta attorney who's been defending voting rights that route you want to go through to corral came to the right place on this episode of of elections shootout George Burns [noise]\nThis is a video called vote Gangnam Style Helens group made it and it shows people signing up to vote outside of Asian grocery stores in Atlanta suburbs [noise] at one point a group of dancing teenagers these joined by congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis Helen says her group signed up\nMore than Fifteen hundred people but there was a problem hundreds of them weren't showing up on the voter registration list she contacted secretary of state Brian Kemp office but Helen didn't get any answers so she went public and got a swift rebuke from camp can you walk me back to exactly when you receive that letter from the secretary of state's office\nI'm sure I read it and I got scared you know um and then test\nCamps litter claimed some of the applications for late or didn't come in at all and he turned the tables he suggested Helen May have broken the law by photo copying the applications and keeping copies in Georgia that could lead to a felony charges so Palin turn to a prominent Atlanta attorney\nEmmett Joplin bond during the second\nThe vast number of ordinary people\nAre easily intimidated by\nExactly that sort of letter\nMr Bond or in eighty one he's a successful corporate lawyer and also something of a voting rights legit\nWay back in Nineteen sixty three you won his first case before the Supreme Court increasing the power of black voters in Atlanta after Helen asked for his help Banderas wrote a letter to the secretary of state letting him know she'd be representing Helen and her organization\nAnd if you got any questions about their activities you directly to me\nYou want to shoot at the OK Corral you came to the right place\nAnd you better think about that\nComes off his back off and didn't file any charges but he's investigated other voting rights groups including one founded by his political opponents Stacey Abrams Kemp says he's just making it harder to cheat bond during calls these investigations part of a broader playbook used by Republicans to suppress the vote [noise]\nSo what happened to hell in Kim hope when I asked her she told me that two years later she went back to check on the people who are group tried to register half still weren't on the rules and then we try to\nPhone banks have on the phone and many of them are no longer interested in\nWorking let that are going back to them because they said they've been turned off so badly\nThe problem Helen Kimmo faced hasn't gone away\nEarlier this month voting rights groups filed a lawsuit claims Brian ... office has violated the voting rights act and the constitution\nAnd issue is a law that freezes applications a name or other info doesn't exactly match other government records even if it's just missing a hyphen ... people can still vote but activists worried they might be discouraged by the confusion\n... ... says there's another voter suppression strategy that still has him stumped it first dawned on him in twenty twelve\nYou're reading an article that the number of registered voters in Georgia had gone down this\nRaise serious questions because\nWe knew Georgia's population was growing who knew\nThere had not been the black death to kill off\nA third of the speech\nAbout population\nWe had to be something else going on\nSo here's what's happening to Banderas missing voters states routinely purge hundreds of thousands of people from their voter registration rolls these are people who've died or moved away or gone to prison but Georgia and at least eight other states have what you could call it use it or lose it lies not voting can get you removed from the rolls\nWorks like this if you sit out a couple of elections you can get put on an inactive list the state sends you a mailer if you don't respond and skip to more federal elections your perch and if you don't know your removed you may show up at your polling place only to find out you can't vote\nUnder camp there's been a massive jumped in purchase\nOn hair brown camps that job is to protect our vote and this is an ad from power pack Georgia its donors promise to ten million dollars to boost Stacey Abrams campaign we just can't trust that Brian camp [noise]\nCan't spend on a bus tour around the state talking about his record\nI went to a stop south of Atlanta outside spray varies barbecue restaurant just regular campaign stop for Georgia Republicans\nKemp steps off the bus and gives his stump speech it's all about putting Georgia first and protecting its values then he gets back on the bus\nI get onto I asked him about the allegations that he'd been aggressively purging voters he looks a little irritated\nWell I Would disagree with that statement what we're doing is within the law and required by law\nSo your office hasn't been more aggressive than others in the past in terms of removing voters from the rolls\nNo I don't believe we have them and we're just going through the process but you know having secure lessons you gotta have secure voter rolls\nKemp says he's made it easier to vote by setting up online registration but during his time in office there's been a big jump in the number of people who've been removed from the rolls more than one point six million have had their registration cancelled [noise]\nI decide to try and find people who've been purged without knowing it in Moultrie the small agricultural town in southern Georgia\nThere's some concerns over there\nWith Angela ... she's an investigative reporter for a PM report and\nWe've got to sort of guide a database with the names and addresses of all five hundred thousand or so people purged in Georgia last year and our analysis shows that in the county where Moultrie is any more than two dozen others the perjury is are disproportionately affecting people of color\n\nMoultrie if the county seat we pass white column homes with manicured lawns and lush magnolias in front on the other side of town we drive over potholes street so long rows of one story ramshackle houses [noise]\nWhen we get to the homes of people who are listed as perhaps some are boarded up and the residents have moved away at some of the other addresses we're told the people were looking for have gone off to college for the military\nThis woman tells us she doesn't vote for religious reasons\nI\nWere still looking for someone who wants to vote in November but doesn't know they've been purged so we go to see Cornelius ponder a member of Moultrie city council hey how you doing but he's also a businessman and pastor at the real church that stands for restoration and if ... and love\nHe says his family's lived in the area for generations\nMy great grandparents uh it was small\nSharecroppers Reverend ponder won his election last year by the slimmest of margins just nine votes she says well he was campaigning he encountered people who've been purged for failing to vote in previous elections\nThat came across all quite a few people and then that led to an Iranian some of them went down to vote and they could and then um I have to be said that they got down there and they didn't have proper documentation anytime there's confusing like that during the ...\nHe says with Trump in office enthusiasm is low in Moultrie in the last election voter turnout was below ten percent voters are also frustrated with all the obstacles purges confusion over polling locations and long lines\nThe races there is no longer worth voting now and I think that's what we're we're we're trouble with\nVan Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nThere\nOh yeah yeah that is very sad\nShe's Monti\nSteve record say Kathleen ponder registered to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year officials struck her name from the rolls river and ponder tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does he and know that she's been taken off the voting list [noise]\nAngela and I find ms ponder living in a small house just outside Moultrie hey\nOut I mean it's all I can say that I'm a reporter with public radio headed\nA story about people who've been removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard of that day St\nAngelo explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years under that Obama is saying do you remember\nNo divorce making her there and\nThen a last July you were taken off the elderly or sell it have been on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen and but you didn't get any notification that you'd\nBe ... you know\nDid you know there is a policy that they take us if you don't\nMiss ... says she had no idea she'd been purged although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey\n[noise] um no I Would not counted as hacking know what was it then\nIt was it was browsing the Web site\nAt this point he sits down and compose an email to the people I Kennesaw state\nHe says look I'm a local cyber security researcher I don't want to make a big deal out of this\nYou should probably know that I turned up all the scary stuff\nHe doesn't hear back right away so he gets the cell phone number from rural king the guy in charge at chaos you get some on the phone but the more they talk Levin says the weirder things\nGet he said that I should probably stop a doing this or to work otherwise people downtown would crush me what did he mean by that at the time I took that to mean a politician's right\nAnd I also took that as more of a warning that a threat\nUh but in hindsight I'm not really sure\nLogan didn't get crushed by politicians or anyone else though the FBI did pay a visit a few months later now he's sitting at the center\nOf a messy situation one that says a lot about the state of election security in Georgia and across the country\nFor about a month after Logan first finds the problem Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp is in Washington DC\nI Want to thank the committee and chairman hurt for invited me to discuss the legs of security\nHe's testifying before a house subcommittee on information technology and over the past few weeks he's been boasting about the security of Georgia system he's also been calling out the federal government for overstepping its election responsibilities and trying to quote subvert the constitution under the guise of security\nBy the way kept doesn't know about Logan findings yet and that this hearing he's going off again\nSure he says the heck on the DNC was troubling but\nThe D.C response to these attacks has been to take steps toward federalizing aspects of the ... election systems in standardizing security measures\nThere is a better way to say hearing goes on for hours but eventually camp starts getting pushback from Jerry Connelly a democratic senator from Virginia Mr Kemp hum I Want to make sure I understood your testimony commonly skeptical\nYou basically says so you're telling us that there's never an election situation that calls for any kind of federal intervention effort and campus like no not really Connelly doesn't buy it\nWhat about the voting rights act he says states were actively disenfranchising people than the government stepped in isn't that positive Kemp doesn't seem to understand the question\nI Would say that the voting rights act is still in that\nYes but it's an example of the opposite of what you were asserting it was an example of federalizing something to protect the franchise I don't believe it because of the states weren't doing it in fact states were actively suppressing votes you don't deny that do\nWell I'm not sure I understand what that has to do with the election system\nWhile I'm dealing with your assertion of the principles that we shouldn't federalize any aspect of this and I'm arguing that the voting rights act is it clear exception to your principal and that\nPerhaps the federal government in federal elections at least has an interest that overrides state interest when it comes to protecting at the cyber level\nThe integrity of the results will certainly your opinion mine differs\n[noise] have you back much Germany\nAt the end of the hearing campus given one last chance to speak any stance from states have this cyber security staff handled he says and in fact maybe federal officials should pay us visit maybe they would learn a few things\nI think there will be very pleasantly surprised [laughter]\nThe team in Kennesaw state was certainly surprised in fact slogans email sent him scrambling they didn't want to be interviewed for this story but all their emails for public record which means you can get them if you asked nicely\nLet's start on August twenty eight twenty sixteen Logan emails K su he tells them what he found and he says quote there's a strong probability your site is already compromise members of chaos you Center for election system starts circulating the email around\nAnd over the next few days they start to realize\nThe school's information security team recommends doing some scans but then the director of the elections team weights and\nHe says wait a minute wait a minute this is our busiest time of year the last thing we want is for the site to become unavailable all these counties Nita reading this at first it's easy to think okay that makes sense\nBut this idea that you can't make elections secure because you're so busy preparing for the election this seems problematic by September fifteenth these scans still haven't been done\nSomeone from the elections team says they're struggling with the technology quote we've discovered we're a little out of our debt\nFinally the elections team gets the breach fix or so they think it's October twenty seven two months after Logan first emailed them\nThey think the security team and said quote this has been a huge help to us reading this email you can basically here this deep sigh of relief like oh this is over except it's not [noise]\nYou might be wondering what Brian Kemp has to say about all this well despite Logan lamb downloading dreams sensitive information which kept called deeply concerning Kemp also said that Georgia is protected with layers upon layers of security\nAnd specifically he's made two arguments\nNumber one the voting machines are never connected to the Internet which makes them safer from hacking\nAnd number two breaking into just one wouldn't really do much you need a wide scale conspiracy actually mess with an election [noise]\nSo there's a good reason to push back on both of those arguments will lose arguments wrong richton Milo is a professor of computer\nScience at Georgia Tech he used to be the chief technology officer at Hewlett Packard\nOr you don't need to mount an attack on thousands and thousands of polling places you just need to have a really good idea a word at target your tax in order to flip the right number of votes in order to get above with racial\nPlus he says because Georgia's system is so centralized there are multiple points of entry for an attacker that's part of what Logan discovery proved not only did Georgia leave itself exposed the people running things didn't even seem to understand how bad the problem was or what was at stake\nThere making it up they're scared to death they're making it up on a day to day basis they have no idea what's going on in these systems that have no idea why they work or don't work and they're kind of living in constant fear that this whole thing is going to come crashing down around two years\nThey also failed to realize something else something really important [noise] five months after Logan made his initial discovery he was hanging out with a friend another cyber security guy\nI was like Christ I ever tell you about that wacky stuff I found a K issue and he said no tell me more [laughter]\nThey sit down at a computer and download everything again except this time there's more because it looks like new info has been added since January so were you able to get the exact same amount of stuff the second time\nOr effectively yeah so nothing had changed well they had a hinted to fix it but in such a way that I I actually don't understand what they were trying to do\n[laughter] okay\n[laughter] those those by my reaction [noise]\nYeah [laughter] I don't really understand [noise]\nKen didn't want to talk for this story but I was able to chat with Kathy Cox Georgia secretary of state from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand seven a Democrat she oversaw the statewide roll out of touch screen machines in the early two thousand and unlike every cyber security expert I've ever talked to she is critical of paper ballots\nFrom dead people voting to ballot boxes are showing up in the bottom of a lake um they're just so many opportunities\nLimited truly only by one's imagination to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even though Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly that Bernhardt is a PHD student at the universe\nShe can she studied theories and their vulnerability\nNot says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you're injecting prevention or indirect basically now we're a virus any part of the street the way it is set up is that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nGeorgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom on the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand\nHow Georgia system works a few days after the hearing", "year": "2018",
