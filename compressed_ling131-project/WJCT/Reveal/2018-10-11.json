been Steve you\nFirst man might be one of the noisiest clunky is most you know we get movies about space travel ever made and I mean that in a good way the film adapted from James are Hansen's biography of Neil Armstrong returns us to a time when NASA technology was in its early stages\nWe first meet Armstrong played by Ryan Gosling as a test pilot in Nineteen sixty one flying a small fighter jet over Southern California at an altitude of around a hundred and forty thousand feet\nThe director Damien ... cell doesn't give us anything so beautiful as an exterior shot at the plane's going through the sky\nHe locks us inside the cockpit the engine noises deafening the images blurry and disorienting the tense close ups of Armstrong's eyes and the rattling motions of the aircraft remind you of the irrationality of human flight the sheer violence of defying the laws of physics\nYou learn a lot about Armstrong in this scene alone he doesn't say much and he's very very good at his job\nEven back on Tara from the camera has a lingering case of the jitters there's a handheld roughness to the scenes of meal at home with his wife Janet played by an excellent clear for it and their children\nTragedy strikes early on the Armstrong's lose their two year old daughter Karen to cancer Neal is devastated and throws himself into his work\nSeeking a fresh start he moved the family to Houston and enters NASA's Gemini astronaut training program\nAlthough gorgeously scored by ... longtime composer Justin her wits first ma'am looks and sounds nothing like their musicals whiplash and Lala land but as it has the same outsized ambition\nThe movie captures the flux set up people in the sixties when NASA found itself caught between the pressures of the Cold War with its mandate to beat the Russians by any means and the resistance of a public unhappy with the program which cost billions of taxpayer dollars and several astronauts lives\nAgainst this tumultuous backdrop should sell and his screenwriter ... singer set themselves the tricky task of dramatizing the inner life of an American hero known for his lack of flash or pretension\nIn one scene Neal was interviewed by NASA panel and he responds to even a probing personal question in a stoic professional way I don't know what\nSpace exploration well uncovered but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration\nI think it'll be more of the fact that it\nAllows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nJust haven't been able to until now\nSee anyone have anything else yeah\nYou know sorry to hear about your daughter\nI'm Sorry to hear a question\nRight but I mean uh do you think it will have an effect\nA reasonable to assume that it wouldn't have some effect\nHow carefully Armstrong guarded his privacy before and especially after the moon landing there's something a bit invasive about the way first manned keeps returning to caring staff linking family tragedy and professional tryouts\nBut for the most part should selling Gosling respect Armstrong's reticence he's unwillingness to speak unless absolutely necessary is home life predictably suffers as it becomes emotionally withdrawn from ... and their two sons\nBut he develops a balance of warm camaraderie and unspoken rivalry with his fellow pilots played by actors including Jason Clarke Patrick future Ethan Embry and Christopher Abbott\nCorey stole gets an amusing loud enough performance as Buzz Aldrin with who meal will share his history making Apollo eleven moment\nThere were points in first man when the disjointed and this of the filmmaking drove me to distraction the leaps forward in time\nThe what she close ups the stubborn refusal to let us get our bearings but after a while those surface ruptures begin to make dramatic and psychological sense\nYou come to understand what it must have been like to be Armstrong from from one hurdle to the next navigating endless chaos losing friends and colleagues plenty of course to the moon driven by little more than ... flights of risk an instinct\nFinally July Nineteen sixty nine arrive and she sells stages the moon landing with the stillness and supplement that feels like both an antidote at an answer to all the proceeding K off\nIt's a sequence of hushed an otherworldly grander that demands to be seen an ibex was possible for several minutes we really do seem to have left the planet earth behind transported to what landscape of dust desolation and wonder\nSome dust was stirred up shortly after first man premiered at the Venice film festival where journalists noted that the movie didn't show the U.S flag being planted on the moon's surface effect that quickly through fire from conservative politicians\nIn fact ... does show the flag after it's been planted he just doesn't treat the planting itself as a combination point\nHe takes the moon landing in achievement that might have been played for easy triumph and turns it into one man's solemn personal reckoning with all the sorrows failures sacrifices and convictions that have brought him to this extraordinary moment\nWe may not truly know Neil Armstrong buy movies and but we know that his one small step contain multitudes\nJust in Chang's film critic for the LA Times if you want to hear the interview we broadcast yesterday

better way of describing either it was when it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that ... it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it certainly\nI Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their tool box when they need it but it's like the tennis arrow never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere is as mines that are the more before we lock up in the more time that we give people the

to send people to prison well Ninety percent of these people had been black\nNinety percent New Orleans is only around sixty percent black\nSo what you're telling me as a nothing's really change from the time he was in prison\nIt's even worse now because so many more people have been locked up and from the inside Prince Albert sees what that looks like\nWall was little more time on the road runner

than he was very emotional and I remember going back and forth because I wanted to give him the time that you needed to discuss this with this family and they want to be intrusive\nPrincess ...
