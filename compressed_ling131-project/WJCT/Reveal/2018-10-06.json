who put him to\nBe a can is arrow use Louisiana's three strikes law the ritual offender statue to local Prince Albert for a really long since the reporter ... has been hearing a lot but it's not just Prince Albert thousands of people\nWho have what is the d._a. have to say about that well\nThe d._a. promised me an interview for this story but he never gave it to me I asked over and over and\nEach time he declined but I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom the first person used to work for ... as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you were a da\nAnd regular here's a seven years but in theory is if you're working at CERN\nThompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used\nA habitual offender statue back then mountains and on and on one of the time and it was just there was a standard\nThat was even lower her office for lack of a better way of describing and it was just the way it was\nSo basically any time that you could use that visual offender statue it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like the tennis arrow never puts this tool away it's\nAlways in his hand for every possible case\nIn fact he helped create end goal is law library\nAfter Harry comic was elected da ... noticed something guys were being prosecuted really aggressively under the habitual offender statute and given sentences like a hundred two hundred years for small crimes\nPeople will come and go to prison\n... like when we then was like to do that for a\nFeeling of television and then he was like that\nBut you did an analysis and found the vast majority of guys prosecuted under this law were black\nHe also found there were white men comic could have gone after but didn't in other words ... uses discretion to punish black men more harshly so in Nineteen Seventy five biggie and another jailhouse lawyer filed a civil rights suit alleging racial discrimination they sued Connick\nSuit gun [laughter]\nYeah I forgot I did that or what but anyway Johnny Was cleaning the motives ... so much and\nPeople wore\nCool hers to plead guilty with the threat of main mode to bill and send them to life and\nSo a lot of people were pretty good the even the wind June\nSo be using this law courses innocent people to plead guilty\nAnd out everybody said that still true in New Orleans all the lawyers I talked to for this story which will get back to anyway biggies lawsuit against kind of getting go anywhere but he was a good jailhouse lawyer and after Twenty one years in prison he got himself out on lifetime parole\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo kind of began using this law to lock people up most of them black men then what happened\nState after state started passing their own harsher three strikes allies and the prosecutors who came after comic kept going on that note guess who Harry kinda hired right out of law school to begin assistant da\nLimit is Leon Kenneth zero bingo ... was about prosecuting cases he certainly wanted us to be successful\nWhen Kennedy was an assistant ... almost five years then he ran for judge and one and for almost two decades every case he presided over came from ... office\nThese are the legal waters Ken has era learned to swim and out I told you cannot Sarah's used a lot more than two thousand six hundred times to send people to prison well Ninety percent of these people had been black\nNinety percent New Orleans is only around sixty percent black\nSo what you're telling me is uh nothing's really change from the time he was in prison\nIt's even worse now because so many more people have been locked up and from the inside Prince Albert sees what that looks like\n... when the bridge to the same foods were\nEnded other people mentioned the habitual offender statute\nYes everywhere when we all have some of those for those of everything\nAnd all these other people were they also from Orleans Parish\n[noise]\n\nKind of hard and was one of princes attorneys he's a public defender also a sharp a dresser blue suit pink tie crisp white shirt\nMr Albert because of his prior convictions his past felonies and they were on drug charges\nHe faced a circumstance where he decided to go to trial\nOr face life face like if you lose mandatory life basically the epitome of the three strikes you're out\nIt was a boost to think of twelve and we're still come to my job and what it was old for\nThat we're going to ignore one of those ... convictions and charged him as a double film you but\nThey also include a number the number of the shows was\nTen years in other words charge prince not for the three strikes just for two double bill him\nThough was kind of you will do good for them\nWas this the first time you've heard of that ...\n[noise] yeah the those are the uh what was the third group\nPrince was hoping for drug court some sort of program to help them tickets habit and stay with us five kids\nA lot of time but it was used as a real is it true true true you\nFeel like you were being black ... ball like drug courts to begin with a\nPrince had to make this decision outside a cramped courtroom people call the addict\nSmall courtroom in it you know this is a very narrow hallway so a lot of our conversations we had to have around the corner where there's a little bit more standing\nAnd I remember there were two two women with him and his dad Conrad was there\nEric ... or I'm than they ever were drawn from\nMore than he was very emotional and I remember going back and\nForth because I wanted to give him the time that you needed to discuss this with his family and they want to be intrusive\nPrincess ... Linda was there to\nKill you so not a ... he was only asking like putting them in a town hall or something like that to help build it has to be\nThere were a lot of tears at one point and recalling him being in prayer about it like literally huddling together really just deciding what to do this was literally all morning and there was one point where I Would go back to resolve and it seemed like he wanted to take the risk and go to trial\nAnd then there was some points where it was like you know what I'm going to take this deal teaches try one more time to see if you can you know they were lower in which I did and they didn't\nReally mole or to both leader more juice\nLove forever for river or love trove of covering about ... above\n... springs drove to the zoo\nI remember him saying in a very fate very\nI'm I'm gonna take to do [noise]\nOne of the things that\nHave to do when you enter a plea of guilty and Mr I'll have to do prince had to do was wonderful to\nSay if I'm not into forced Britain or coerced into\nIn earnest plea of guilty\nAnd yet the initial that\nInto their jaws was she asked it back to him yes ma'am [noise]\nWhatever you were basically [noise]\nLife or ten years\nHow is that not cars how was that not forced how is that not threatened but yet we have people every single day stand before a judge\nAnd they are entering this\nBecause they feel they have to avoid a worse consequence\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nTwo thousand and twelve the your prince was prosecuted with Ken is there it was high point for using the habitual offender statute he prosecuted five hundred people under the law that year it has gone down since then officially but even these numbers of people prosecuted under the law\nThey don't tell the full story what do you mean well the da's office also uses this law and a different way to get people to plead guilty in cases where the law never appears on the record\nFor example they'll tell someone charged with a misdemeanor crime a petty offense plead guilty or will bump up your charge to a felony which is a much more serious crime New Orleans public defender Lauren Anderson sees this every day\nWith a client has for example of civil battery charge which is a misdemeanor\nBut there was some kind of object he used an out we've been told you know well if they don't play into it over here and like all across the street and aggravated battery so they'd be looking at twenty to life on it persisted there to fix my you're saying that they would change the charge\nSo that they could then employ the multiple bell correct exactly and there's no record of this\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal the negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges that have digital offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here right\nWe know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [noise]\n\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story which is frustrating because he's an elected official\nBut he did offer a statement about princes case here a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert\nVoluntarily entered into a plea agreement and received a legal sentence under Louisiana law if he believes himself not guilty he could've exercise has constitutional right to stand trial ... said", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "06"}
