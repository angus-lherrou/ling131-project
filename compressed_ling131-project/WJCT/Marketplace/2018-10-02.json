American producers\nSo the last time you were on marketplace you were scheduled to appear before Congress to talk about your application for an exclusion from the steel tariffs which was denied a how did that appearance go\nWell the the experience it was everything you'd imagine you know the the stately boardroom when hundreds of people watching you and um I think it it was surprisingly well like I made my point and\nFor some changes made to the exemption process that accommodated my concerns as well as the concerns of the three other companies that also testified alongside me\nMy main Bush was for the exemption requests to be retroactive to the first date they're submitted not the first day that uh the Commerce Department decides to look at the request it entered into their system\nAnd that still didn't give me the exemption I'm Still working on that I'm now talking to US Customs\nFor the correct a import code the there was a discrepancy with that so it it's it's definitely a

is marketplace I'm Amy Scott in for my results after big storms like last month's Hurricane Florence recovery is not only slow but extensive some estimates put the damage at twenty to thirty billion dollars for Florence and a portion of that will go to repairing the beaches effect is\nThe U.S government spends a lot of money repairing coastal communities after big storms Lisa song as a reporter for ProPublica and wrote about the high cost of beach re nourishment\nAnd how that money is divvied up welcome Lisa\nThanks for having me at least that can you tell me what beach nourishment means well\nIt's basically when the government comes in and they pump a lot of sand onto your beach to a fix that damage to the beaches that have occurred throughout roshin or through storm damage\nAnd the reason why a federal state and local governments will fund this is that without beach nourishment some beaches in the U.S particularly on the east coast in the Gulf Coast\nAre just getting smaller every year um they're retreating and so the people who own property on the beach obviously want the beach just stay where it is and those teachers are very important to the tourism economy\nHow much does all this cost and where's the money coming from it\nCosts a lot um so many of these projects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beach it so the government should help fund their economies\nThe people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties so these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect and which to leave alone\nThis is sort of decided on a case by case basis some communities actually find most of this work themselves to the local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions they use an economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd the reason that is is that the corps tries to see which projects can they\nThey'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up savory more affluent communities", "show_name": "Marketplace", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "02"}
