{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "A covered criminal justice for the New York times for almost Fifteen Years and I had written the previous book about a black family with multiple generations of criminals\nAnd I wanted to find a white family which could illustrates is because some of the studies were were done so long ago that most of the the all the people and some of the study is for the one in Boston for example were all white and I wanted to see if I could take race out of the equation to disentangle race from crime\nSo let's talk about the family you focused on in this book there the bowls um they're white as you already mentioned they're poor you traced this family all the way back to ... right after the civil war and\nYou discover sixty members of the family ended up in prison or jail or some juvenile reform ... which is just staggering Internet itself\nYes it sounds like something that a ... I Believe it or not and the people who did the statistical studies that found that five percent of families account for half of all crime\nThat they never went the next step and looked at individual families to see why crime spreads and families how did you find the vocals specifically well it was really an accident and a friend of mine who worked in the Oregon department of corrections called me one day and we were talking and I asked him if\nHe knew of of a white family with a significant number of prisoners in it and he said I'll have to call you back and he did a couple of days and he said I've got a family their weight and I think they've got six members who who are now are have been in prison\nBut we had no idea that point that they were as many sixty who had been in prison or jail\nNow the patriarch they use zero in on in this book is a man named rooster Bogle can you tell us about him how as a father and as a husband rooster Bogle helped reinforce the terrible choices members of his family were making\n... rooster took a lot of pride in being tough and having committed a crime which landed him in in prison in Texas when he was only Seventeen and he wanted his sons to grow up to be at least as tough as he wasn't as bad as he was and remind us what was his first arrests for\nHis first arrests was for a burglary of the local a grocery store he was living in Amarillo, Texas\nAnd in fact almost everybody in the family participated in the burglary including a roosters mother and one of roosters sisters as well as all his brothers and they they made off with twenty thousand dollars which doesn't seem like a lot now but and in Nineteen sixty it was a lot of money yeah\nBut it was like a family day it was like going on a picnic or something\nYes exactly going down a picnic a barbeque in Texas\n[laughter] but as ... grew older he continued his criminal behavior and the family he raised he taught them that it was kind of a badge of honor to get in trouble with the law\nYes and he would he would take his kids out and commit crimes of them they would break into their neighbors' homes or they would break into their mailboxes and take their Social Security checks\nThey would steal people's cows and chickens or they would go into a lumber yard and take lumber with sure they would refill or anything that they could do and a one incident to the kids talked about was the one night he had organized his entire family including his wife\nSons and daughters and they'd go onto the bugs will damage big dam on the Columbia River outside of Portland and going into the fish hatchery and stolen all the Cohen Chinook salmon that they could find in the fish hatchery there and loaded them in their truck and drove them home and either eight them are sold them\nBut it was more than just adventures and shenanigans I mean you explore a very dark side to the way ... rooster raised his family there was rampant physical abuse sexual abuse psychological abuse which leads me to the ultimate question what's the more powerful force\nWhen it comes to shaping criminal behavior did you find it with genetics or family values\nI started out looking as family values\nWhat was obvious in talking to the ... was that they were very conscious of imitating the behavior of their father and of their aunts and uncles and\nGrandmother and grandfather oh who met criminal records and then they did not have any what criminologist we call social controls so they didn't go to church on Sunday school we didn't belong to any organization like the boy scouts\nThey didn't have other adult role models but beyond that I began to get interested in if there was any role of genetics and this in criminology has been a no no or taboo subject for a long time\nBecause they can dangerously trend to the question of how race yes city turning criminality\nIs so there were in recent years certainly since the ... the human genome\nSome scientist began to look at behavioral genetics and there was a professor at Duke who is a criminologist and her work indentified several genes which could be precursors\nTo impulsivity which is a characteristic of a lot of criminals but she stresses that there's no such thing as a criminal gene which in combination with the environment so if you have a family environment like the moguls and you have this variant of the gene\nThen you have kind of a double whammy I\nTo end our conversation as un ditch your book um by talking about Ashley she's rooster ... granddaughter she was kind of the aberration in his family she's a good student she wants to do good she became the first member of the ... and a hundred and fifty years to go to college\nWhen I graduated from college and graduate from college what can you learn from Ashley story\nThat she herself says it's a matter of individual choice in the end she chose not to do what she saw around her she didn't like what was happening to everybody else in her family\nSo she decided to try to stick to a good path and that she can break the cycle and she broke a cycle ended in her case she had a little help because her mother was actually the daughter of a policeman in a prison guard\nAnd a grandmother who was a nurse so she had some very good influences in her family that would help to overcome some of the Bogle side of her family\nFox Butterfield new

at marketplace dot org slash wander you might just hear answered on the air and our series I've always wondered [noise]\n\nThis is marketplace I'm Todd result you've heard perhaps of the Sinclair broadcast group a behemoth of a local television conglomerate that gets attention every now and then for its top down and very conservative political agenda that winds up on the air and dozens of local markets across the country\nThere is though a business model story that goes along with Sinclair how it got so big and so influential ... one of our front of regulars I should say she wrote about it for the New Yorker magazine where she's a staff writer she looks good to talk to you again\nGreat to be or ... or so maybe the place to start actually assist with a little primer on on who or what Sinclair is because it's it's been a little a couple of months anyway since his company has been a miners\nSinclair is the largest owner of broadcast television stations in the U.S a and a lot of people are not terribly familiar with them the way they hear about CNN and NBC and other big networks uh Sinclair owns a hundred and Ninety two stations in eighty nine markets\nSo they are enormously influential they're seen by a lot of people are but they're they're largely outside the coastal media bubble\nBack up to that size thing because that is is relevant in a lot of ways uh for the context of this article because there are regulations and and considerations about who can on what media was right\nRight well regulation of television has changed over time and it has loosened overtime but in general there are a lot of restrictions around media ownership for reasons of preserving competition and local markets and also because\nA diverse points of view and diverse sources of news are considered to be sort of fundamental to uh maintaining a free and open democracy\nSo dig down into this a little bit and give me I guess maybe the ... the first one of these that Sinclair did back in the day was in Baltimore and and explain how they got around the rules I suppose is is the question I'm looking\nFor so so what they did was they would acquire a competitor station uh the FCC would say well you need to divest you need to sell one of these stations in order to comply with the regulations and the laws\nBut then uh they came up with a very clever trick the help of their lawyers and they would just simply divest the second station to a shell company run by sort of a business associates or a member of the Smith family which is a family that controls Sinclair\nYou know so they would be able to say to the FCC that they sold the station but in fact the station was still not really independent and then they would sign an agreement that would give them the right to supply all of the programming to the station\nLet's get the Sinclair response in your us them you know how did you guys get away with their citizens and they say their line has been for many years we're middle legal requirements right\nYes they I mean incredibly they did a managed to stay within the strict interpretation of the law although they they violated the spirit of the law one could say but yes what they did was strictly legal but it was it was ... and it was pushing the line for sure\nSo to the to the other half of that question then why did the Federal Communications commission led Sinclair do this show many times\nThere is no simple answer to that I mean that the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous monopolies to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for this as sort of fraudulent divested ... strategy\nThey ended up finding that Sinclair had violated some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent divest teachers and um they find the company brace herself or forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair\nA word here in defense of the Federal Communications commission or Sinclair has wanted to buy Tribune Media for a while they had a deal and just recent well a number of months ago but recently in relative terms\nOr the German the FCC ... pi set in essence I'm not going to let that happen the Tribune\nMerger was sort of a fascinating little window into the business in regulatory environment that has sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith end up Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of doing that but what we've learned\nThat is and it's I think there was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort to appease their regulators and get their deal approved\nAnd they had had such success for such a long period of time that they figure the odds were in their favor", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "22"}
