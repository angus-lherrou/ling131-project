bringing welcome to the program Hi Kay so this is going to sound like a weird way to start this interview but um it the ... the entire premise of this article and and the job of\nIntimacy coordinators is that for actors this shit is a workplace it's the office\nYeah and I mean I think that you know it hasn't been treated like that in the past I don't think that it was necessarily\nOut of nine ten

where you have to say that right but but how does she do how does she do that\nAlicia well off and get the script and she will go to the actor and shelter tell them what's in the scraps and then she will work it out with them defining what they feel comfortable with talking to them\nAbout their boundaries about anything that they would like on set to help them feel safe so then go back to the director on the producers and see if she can work something out everyone else got about then when it comes to the day of filming\nShe is often standing with and I shot of Dr um she is usually looking at the monitor to see how the scene is playing a so she's there to comment on the\nChoreography and she will help them protect themselves she'll tell them how to make things look more real without them having to do something that feels more sexual to them so it's about choreography the same way that we have fight scene choreography\nRight uh HBO it kind of makes sense is is leading the way on
