a result of that crisis was more the result of the decisions you made prior to when you were deep in the middle of that crisis so are you going to work every day just kinda hanging on for the right\n[laughter] no it wasn't quite like that I think ah I think in my first Ninety Days as CEO I was so successful in having the stock price there probably are any of those that have made it a decade who are able to achieve that\nYeah um what is it or was it I suppose uh about financial services that they got you know what I mean you've found is your first financial services to your own financial services company when you were like twenty what two or three or something\nTwenty two actually my uh my formal training was has a pension actuary so I I provided consulting services eventually that business evolved to where we needed a link between our computer systems and where the money ... and we linked up with Schwab and over a few years\nWe became Schwab largest client and then twelve acquired my farm a few years after that you know your boss Charles Schwab who's still the German the board and and uh active in the company as I understand it also by the way like the

client asset than anyone else of size so\nDoes your mind when he was released or do you feel that way to generating less revenue come on\nAbsolute less revenue per dollar because what it ultimately means chi's relieving more money in the pocket of the investor and and and it was her money to begin with I mean our job is about helping them get outcomes that makes sense\nAnd to the extent we do that do reward us with more business I think that's a whole lot better way to grow then to try to extract maximum revenue from every client and and also I Would say that chocolate view that is maybe one of the most important legacies of his founding this company over four decades ago how\nOften do you talk to him every day I just left his office about five minutes before I put the headset on
