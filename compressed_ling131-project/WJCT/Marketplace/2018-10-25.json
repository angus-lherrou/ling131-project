{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "By gather good with stretching libido looking bad guys that you often to be okay so what\nIs going on in Nineteen eighty eight that is feeding all this energy and hip hop well\nI mean ... is a banner year I mean in immediate stretches estimation it's the last time there was truly a meritocracy where the best artist sold the most amount of records based on the fact that they would do we saw independent labels collaborating with major labels to get water distribution but not compromising the music\nAnd we saw a hurled of black consciousness we just saw a of a great variety of women and men are it it was just like if you look at the tops and artist ... of the era none of them sounded the same and they all talked about something different\nDo you have comedians like Bismarck ... you had a rock him who is very serious and pretty much made a career of running but how dopey is yeah you have Chuck these militancy you had more accessible hip hop with Jesse Jackson the fresh prince who was just incredibly buried and just really rich\nAnd then you had a story teller likes like Rick\nLadies and gentlemen and low life is without than in pledge that we are here to present tonight slick ... why don't\nI Want to talk about that because his album the great adventures\nOf flick Rick is one on your list um but Vito Garcia that you think we should talk a little bit more about flickering has got an eye patch and an attitude and and some literature and gold angle and the lyrics that I Can't even really discuss or play in front of my parents'\nLet's say like I say well I mean he he was a phenomenal stories of what kind of opens the door\nFor hip hop to imagine beyond New York he was born in the u._k. and to not shy away from the British access\nHe also was a style I caught he wore jewelry and not a big change that as well but because his album went platinum because you want to be raps at the time\nWas blasting imagery of rap music on national television and in uh Madison was unprecedented excuse me to grips with his ... and what does suits with ice patch it just kind of breathe life it's a hip hop and so many ways\nThe compliments showed up and went up to the beach like you don't\nEven try to just wipe them why she almost trying to disrespect them regularly\nNow here's the thing with the introduction of character and swagger you have a lot of massage and eat right and you have a lot of lyrics that for women hip hop fans we listen to\nBut we weren't loving so how do the women and Caesar apply like what is going on in Nineteen eighty and what is the music that we're hearing\nYeah you know it's funny and eighty eight wouldn't end up the way came out one of the things that was so shocking about them was there sort of very free use of of curse words however us up to say that massaging the and kind of awful ideas and stories weren't conveyed without using curse words because there were\nDefinitely a women counters that and by eighty eight we see a a sophistication and relevance of women and hip hop that I don't think we saw prior on the level that it was right there is a release of queen ... song wrath of my madness oh we loved and [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nShe arrived on the scene it felt\nFully formed like I think people forget just how young she was especially now that she's this like cover girl [laughter] I Know of award winning ... I mean yeah she's had a talk show yeah back then she was a kid and she was striking she\nIs a phenomenal singer and she was a phenomenal lyricist and M. C. [noise] you know despite the massaging the in hip hop when some of my ... came out with a song like this she was\nImmediately accepted when it came out you hurt it everywhere every mix show every club but it was a that record was running\nThe other person I Want to bring up is mc light because I think well I think ... someone who does the kind of like singing Iran thing and feels very mainstream I feel like and the lights went really hard [laughter] uh and we have her song here ten percent\nChange can be the main avenues jam I really don't want them because they're so rough\n[laughter]\nSo both of these artists you have people who I think Larry ... are very good but also those lyrics are not just about being attractive [laughter] being about attractive to men um and it feels like that's something I'm going to remember from eighty eight\nI think overall in eighty eight the premium was to be original unique and really attempt to push the platform forward so what we see fc lie what was the ... who was around the time as well uh we let people\nWhere we see all the the men and we will we've already mentioned as well is that it was super competitive and it was just like the the doors wide open and and the possibilities which is endless you\nAlso see artists having an eye on expanding that success Lucy artist that had real street credibility start to make records that perhaps compromised the style that endeared them to to fans um if you look at salt and pepper excuse me salt and pepper\nAlso had a crossover hit in Nineteen eighty southern Cal pushes which you'll still hear

you've been very successful at getting venture capitalists to invest in you and your vision [noise] what's that\nIt's what's the what's the elevator pitch sure\nI mean the way he was inspired by history really um and that the turn of the twentieth century and sort of late Nineteen century there were hundreds of women's clubs and so they were a huge part of the suffrage movement in the overall advancement of women in this country but they kind of died out our idea was to resurrect them\nFor modern women but you know the difference between when a hundred years ago and women today is that women today work\nTell me about your clientele would you your customers what do we know about them I mean you just introduced childcare right so clearly so more parents with small children\nYes um you

capital funding are they're really abysmal only about three percent of all I'm ... capital dollars go into business is founded by women as a woman going out to raise tens of millions of dollars\nIt's it's incredibly intimidating I'm it's intimidating to know those statistics emanating to walk into a room full of men in suits um around a boardroom table\nOur initial you know seed round was very challenging um just because there wasn't anything that had existed like this and we didn't have proof of concept yet um and there were frankly a lot of men who just said like\nI just don't get it you know I just don't get the products\nYou imagine do you foresee a day uh and and I grant you that it feels like we're a long way from it no with me too and all that but do you foresee a day where this
