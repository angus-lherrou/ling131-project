{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "In this movie forty years later we find\nReally what happens when someone suffers the trauma when they're Seventeen years old and doesn't get any help you know Lori strode she left school on the thirty first of October a dreamer and intellectual someone who would have gone on to brown and changed the world\nAnd instead on November first she went back to school a freak\nAnd that's what happens with trauma it brands you up people point and call gosh ... she's the one who survived and it took\nAway her innocence I think one of the characters in the movie or a doctor characters or something along the lines of there are many ways tragedy and violence can change a victim and it can make people may be sad in in ... in this case it makes her\nKind of a doomsday proper right I mean she is now not living in fear but lying in wait yeah\nBut that's all in response to only one idea that she has per separated about for her entire life\nWhich is that he will come back for her and she has lost everything she ended up in a couple of relationships that were failed she ended up having a child to state came and took the child from her because she was an unfit mother unfit because her only goal\nEvery day was to prepare her daughter for the fact that Michael Meyers was coming back\nI think I had been my notes why won't her dumb family believe her [laughter]\nLike you know it it that it does is excellent thing that happens in horror movies where you can be in the audience thinking why aren't you listening but her family is trying to tell her and not a subtle way to get over it\nAll the hiding all the preparation and it was for nothing [noise] it took priority of your family it costs here family if the way I raised her mother\nFor the horse world than\nAnd get over it everybody's trying to tell her to get over it I think that's been the sort of refrain in her ears since she was Seventeen years old\nAnd in a weird way you know that is all of our ways of trying to distance ourselves from that person's trauma nobody wants to really get into it\nAnd it's much easier to give somebody a pain killer and say get over it you talk about Lori like she's a real person she is a real person how long has she felt\nHave you felt close to this character because we should say that this was kind of you're coming out party for you personally um can you talk a little bit about that idea\nIt was a role I had been on a TV series prior where I was one of six women with maybe two lines a week and here was a script that was completely a character full character with a really emotional and dramatic arc\nAnd so for me honestly her name is on every page of the script and I was thrilled I'm a bit of a smart alec I have a trash talk out not an intellectual and a big emotional hug a lot\nAnd here was a role of a quiet intellectual repressed\nVirginal dreamer\nA who walked down the street and sang to herself I Wish I had you oh I'm\nYou know there was a romance to her\nAnd so for me she was the best role really I'd ever been able to play\nThing that's interesting is I'm thinking of how John Carpenter who along with a co writer Deborah hell created the franchise you're listed along with him as an executive producer and that is the incredible to think like you started out in Nineteen year old [laughter]\nAnd now your executive producer of it I never thought I'd have it and you have to his Audie\nReally though I mean I listen to this people are like Tony Curtis and ... like you don't think acting somewhere [laughter]\nI never thought about it for a second I wasn't very pretty I was cute I had great chief from my mother taking Tetris cycling when I was\nYou know in utero I wasn't particularly talented I couldn't sing and I couldn't do musical theater I just sort of showed up my point is here I sit talking about a movie that I've been involved with for forty years\nAbout some things that it's up about something and that all of my life experiences have added up to this moment\nIs not something I had any idea what happened it's kind of incredible\nSo I I don't have a better thoughts than that [laughter] I'm happy for you Jamie we\nCreate our out I'm and by the way I Am happy don't get me wrong\nI did an interview for um New York magazine with David ... and in a communication with me when we were sort of signing off an email exchange where he was doing some background information he said enjoy your victory lap\nOh and I started of course just started bowling my eyes out because that's how it feels I've been going around the world sort of high fiving people with the astonishment of this moment I've worked hard\nBut I Am I don't expect it and that's what a gift is when you don't expect something and then it's given to you and you open it and go\nWow cue that's incredible and that's what I feel David Gordon Green and Danny McBride gave me when they allowed me\nTo go where we had to go to explain and honor the courage and tenacity of Laurie Strode who represents all women who've been addressed all women who've had to fight back all women who've survived\nAnd that's a privilege and not something I take lightly well it\nHas been an incredible journey and was a real honor to speak to you\nWell thank you ... it's been a a great privilege and a happy Halloween
