think that that maybe people are worried about their privacy at all\n... which may well be the case right the as we have talked about let me ask you a different but related question it's kind of business model and it goes like this hardware is not Facebook's core competency\nYeah I mean separated from all of that I think it is very interesting that Facebook wants to get into the hardware business it is tricky there are low margins it is hard to get right\nYou add a whole customer service layer that didn't exist before you know Google and Amazon both worked for years to get consumer
