{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Or or there would be unintended consequences to their policy but actually evil and that's that's not a recipe for going forward in the American system assumes that politics do a limited number of things but the really interesting things happen in your family and your neighborhood in your workplace in your local worshipping community\nAnd right now so many of those local tribes of textured meaning er and collapse and people are looking for substitute tribes in politics and I don't think that's going to work out very well\nYou talk about the idea of red and blue jerseys you also talk about um cable news being a problem social media being a problem um why is it cable news or something to pick out in particular\n[noise] well we don't have enough shared facts right and so the business model of a lot of different media consumption right now is about trying to deepen and intensify the anger against that you can find in your one percent news tribe\nThat maybe it's worth back it up and just looking about what the dissident mediation if media has done in the Nineteen fifties when there were only three channels\nUh Seventy percent of American households every week tuned in I Love Lucy that wasn't important content but it was shared content\nSo when you think about the MSNBC and the Fox News I'm sort of tribes in the world they're each getting about one percent of the American public\nBut it's a deep an intense one percent that doesn't think there's really any need to reach across the divide and have any sense of ... that's a really unhelpful set of economic incentives that cause us to silo ourselves off from our neighbors\nAnd you go on those shows you don't have to\nA fair point you got to talk to Nebraska it's however you can get to um I live in Nebraska but that's on weekends and so in DC Monday to friday I fly off to my day job and Nebraska's a small place but it's still one point nine million people across the Ninety three counties and a couple of times zones\nA four hundred and fifty miles east to west so you want to talk to your people and listen to your people however you can get to them but right now it would be a lot more useful if we had a sense of we which bridged across some of those one percent divides\nSo I'm not picking on you for going on cable I think\nHe got to do what you got to do but it seems like lawmakers have a hand in this right if they are red and blue jerseys you guys are handing them out and the elephant in the room so to speak would be maybe the president Donald Trump right people talk a lot about his language and his rhetoric how is that not divisive are contributing to the problem\n[noise] sure so I've been critical of the president or on a number of these points but I think it's also important for us to recognize that what we're struggling with right now didn't start two years ago this isn't about Donald Trump Donald Trump or no other politician can fix it either this is about a two year old problem this is that two plus decades problem in the making\nBut can I come back to this point because I think you know lawmakers contribute to divisiveness the way you talk to each other the way you talk about each other the way you talk about us as voters the way you talk about activists I'm we hear people being described as evil as mobs right\nI I think I mean you're surely right there's a lot of blame to go around and that kind of people we have serving in politics right now have become a tribe of people who think politics or the center of life and I think ... to ... you know if I could give a message to American voters\nOr don't elect people who think politics or the most important venue in American Life politics again a really important\nBut it's a place to do specific things to maintain a framework for to liberty so that communities of love and persuasion and volunteerism can actually thrive and flour\nThe things that make Americans happy or do you have a nuclear family do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful calling you have shared work do you have shared vocations do you have a local worshipping communities all of those things are connected to place\nAnd places being undermined by the digital revolution right now in this great stuff in the digital revolution\nBut it is undermining our habits of being anchored in a place and we've got more and more politicians who go off to Washington DC and they never really plan to leave Washington DC or the cable news stratosphere they never really plan to go back home those kind of ...\nThere are rooted in grounded and they're not going to make very good leaders for a republic\nSo you don't sound that excited to be a politician and yet people talk about you are in terms of uh maybe running for president one day left to talk about that [laughter] you don't sound that excited to be fair\nI I think it's all it takes has a very useful role to play but it's about a framework for liberty it's about the frame right the picture for him but the middle of the frame is American families thriving and working with their neighbor and disagreeing over the dinner table for days\nAlliances because you know you you were you tweeted someone who was saying oh I regularly consider leaving the Democratic party you basically said oh yeah I feel the same only about being a Republican\nYeah I don't think either of these parties has a long term view right now I think both of these parties are mostly trying to do anti tribe\nNot whether you're for or what are the Democrats' big unhealthy long term visions of what other Republicans big unhealthy ten and twenty year long visions but both parties spend most of their time trying to explain why the other party is even worse than they are\nAnd uh I think the two party system was not what the founders intended and I don't think is what we're going to have forever but right now we're locked into a two party World War both of these\nI'm sort of do up all of us are pretty content to just run against each other and tried to hold down any discussion about new and constructive policy ideas going forward but I think voters want better than that\nDo you want to be one of the choices are we going to see on the ballot\nA I'm a first time politician I think I'm One of eight people in the U.S Senate who's never been a politician before and we have three little kids and the deal we had at our household was if the voters in Nebraska give us a six year calling for the first four and a half of those six years\nWe'd act like we were never going to do it again was a a a short term calling and next summer a July August of twenty Nineteen my wife and I are due to go and sit down and figure out what we think we might be called to in the future\nBut when you've got little kids and you lived on a campaign bus or for sixteen months I think we did a Ninety three Nebraska counties and I think my baby at that point vomited in almost all Ninety three of them the idea of multiplying that times fifty sounds like a really really terrible proposition so I I think I'm not the right guy\nBen Sasse thank you so much for speaking with us thanks for having me Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse his new book is called them why we hate each other and how
