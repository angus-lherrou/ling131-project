[noise]\nYears of touring he says he started to feel burnt around the edges\nSo he walked away\nI'm Still singing okay I'm Still doing the shows but but that feeling I had when I was six seven years old that passion for music I discovered in half or California listened to forty fives on my photograph player was gone\nOh\nI knew what I had to do was just simply stop\nThat's what I Do is I went back to my home town of Hanford I bought a Harley Davidson I drove it out in in the country roads coyote road where there's ... posts and windy and my hair and I think I just needed to connect to get a read read touch the ground from where the dream started\n\nI Know you give a lot of credit to someone you fell in love with as the impetus for the entire new album Kelly Kelly Nash [noise]\nYeah I understand that you met her when you were visiting the production of a TV series about breast cancer she was actually a a real cancer patient who was on the set and\nAnd you've noticed her immediately\nWhere I was sitting with Patty Jenkins who's really close friend of mine the director and the camera was pending across this\nHospitals where everybody just having lunch and pick camera came across her and I said depending on how can you freeze it right there who sat with us Kelly now she's a PHD psychologist and there was something about our smile there was something\nIncredibly genuine and incredibly beautiful and\nI said well you have an email and she says I Do but\nSteve and she looked at me 'cause she knows I don't do this\nWe said you weren't someone who would ordinarily reach out to him by email or you would ordinarily make the first move you you start you\nKnow not that aggressive you'd be surprised she says will I Will but there's something I Need to tell us it was such that um [noise]\nWell she was in remission but it's come back and now it's in her bones in her lungs and she's fighting for our life so I had this moment where my heart said send the email so then I sat on pins and needles for two weeks\nSo why why do you think you reached out knowing you would probably setting yourself up for something painful\n[noise] oh no I just felt like if I didn't it was\nAnd she got back to me an email one night she called me about six thirty at night and\nWe talked until midnight showing mentioned I Know we just couldn't stop talking you know and I just wanted to be with her all the time\nUm I Know that she made you promised or something it's the reason you're making yourself make music again can you tell me before she passed away in twenty twelve what did she ask you\nOne of my favorite times when we would talk to each other to sleep\nSo one night she says I Need to ask you a favor as such as what you promised that if something were to ever happened to me that you wouldn't go back into isolation for I feel it would make this off or not\nAnd I'm telling you know so when I heard those words I could see her life I could see her getting diagnosed or could see her struggle because she asked me to hear could see the possibility of a stop being together the whole thing was a huge park so I said I promise\n\nWhich sign on this new album feels like you're singing to Kelly [noise]\nThere are two sons are wrote before I met her and I never played them for her because I was afraid to bring the energy into a fight 'cause they were about last one is called most of our\nWhich is the ones who've lost her most of all many years won't Hugh\nOh\nLast\nThat became the good news because from the came joy and songs and ideas and it just did that\nYou know there's a lot on his album sounds like the kind of stadium rock songs you were known for I mean just the first track knowing racing it feels like you're announcing that will determine that\nWhen I heard that I was like totally deals like a journey song but\n... years after\nI wrote a lot of SARS and the bad I sang in the band so that's going to happen from time to time\nThe parents that we're part of you to\nThat would be a beautiful problem if I could see Perry poise honey ain't no spring chicken you know that I mean come on\nThey're also songs that sound not being late journey for instance ah October in New York\nAnd I was listening to that I was like who is this I feel like I mean a dean Martin\nDream or stress from there's some way to\nMy new life until I'm no longer able to talk to you girl is going to be about recording anything that comes to my heart 'cause I rediscovered a passion for music and it is something I don't want to let go of ever\nOh\nDeep Perry his
