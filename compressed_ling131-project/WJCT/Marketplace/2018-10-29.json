airport made pretty good time which was nice but anyway we pulled up in front of a brand new building in a mostly warehouse looking district\nCan morning it's nice to have you here it's cool to be your\nBest Jeanie Buss choose the reason we were there she's the president and CEO of the Los Angeles Lakers\nThis is the UCLA Health training center the Lakers training facility\nIs a nice nice building as if it's a sports franchise worth more than three billion dollars but the Lakers are more than just a basketball team right there a global brand and one of the great teams in the NBA history although not recently and not really the season yet but more about that in a minute\nFundamentally the Lakers are and this is the genius dad longtime owner of the team Jerry Buss would've wanted their entertainment company with outsized influence but you got to deliver on the court and lately as I said the Lakers haven't\nSo Jeanie Buss went after and she got this past offseason LeBron James the best basketball player in the world right now and she brought him to this building there is tons of natural light clean modern lines also a whole lot of purple and gold all with the business of basketball firmly in mind\nWe moved here just over a year ago we had outgrown our other training facility which is just a couple of blocks away and our entire revenue generating arm was in a building across the parking lot so we were a very divided company\nSo this was as we should are overlooking basketball courts in I mean there's like three basketball courts or whatever it is um this was a strategic investment for example [noise]\nYes yes the architects that we ended up choosing talked about how architecture could change culture\nAnd an organization and that was you know exactly what we were looking to do back in twenty twelve we had a player by the name of Dwight Howard that played on the Lakers I mean and we were at our old facility he came up to my office\nAnd he said can I ask you something and I said sure and he goes where the people that work here\nAnd it was then I realized that it was important for them to know how we operate behind the scenes and so this building is a walkable building there is no barriers that you can make a full circle without having to divert through anything or being stopped and backtrack\nSo let's go with all your so I'm Serious little walk and talk so\nOkay herself on me do this way and as you notice um we have I think six or seven conference rooms that is one is called twenty pat and\nThat address on the front there regard for the for the last year in France of yeah he'll eat showing the ones that are ... that that's that's what I'd like to know that million dollar question\nWhen the Lakers are in town is a busy around here I mean granted it's only nine o'clock in the morning but\nUm yes when the Lakers are here this would be when they would normally practice oh brave here in our um [noise]\nShe league a coaching staff as they get ready for practice you just said but also yeah that that South bay Lakers is our team um that we use to develop our draft picks you know bringing free agents that weren't drafted\nI'll take you in here to the war weren't real cause more than ... says take where the draft is how\nDo you know there are one two three four at least four or five like Ninety edge television screen which are showing basketball or ESPN of course um but this oh and you can or the best guess is would you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and when you know when you hear the basketball's it's kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if oh so there you go you know we are one of the player\nSo we'd rooms trading rooms right of course are over\nThe beautiful weight rooms and joke\nSo this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the place where the rubber meets the road um [noise] so what keeps you up at night but\nWhat's your worst [laughter] 'cause my ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the class every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to it in terms of Lakers basketball\nHaving the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but are kind of have to ask her view in la brown and ... near coaching and Magic Johnson drudge were basketball and then you
