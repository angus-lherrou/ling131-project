football league lasts just three points three years\nOr so wildly lasted ten years on four teams in the NFL made it to a pro bowl and then found his way to ESPN and now Fox Sports in his retirement but the idea that he would have even make it to the pros to begin with seemed far fetched his new book about his life and career and what came after that is called never shut up Marcel is one of the things coming in\nOh thank you so much so about about this book a first of all agree totally fascinating I I have to ask you about the subtitle though okay life opinions and unexpected adventures of an NFL outlier way since where are you an NFL outlier menu played that link for ten years you made a good selling dollars yeah I guess that's\nNot so unique but ah to get there was a unique experience coming from Columbia University not the yellow brick road to the NFL\nLiberal back farther let's go back before Colombia right 'cause first of all getting drafted out of Columbia which has a terrible football team and apologies to all the Colombia fans of ... the way to speak the truth I I Know um you grow up like three miles down the road in yeah in South central LA I\nDate I'm born and raised in Compton south central LA right here in the heart of the city in the heart of a lot of gang activity\nOr the drugs are poverty I decided to be more responsible with my talents in only had two which was academics in athletics\nOr and and size right I mean you're physically gifted due to right yeah it's got to be thrown in there and I'm a not not my favorite story about growing up down there but uh maybe the most illustrative story is the first concussion you ever had was not on the football field [noise]\nNo it wasn't I'm Crazy enough when the concussion lawsuit came around for NFL players may I ask me what I joined it and one of the reasons I didn't join is because my first concussion was not football related it was being on a park\nSeven years old on the swings and all of a sudden I see some gangsters coming up acting like they're my friends are we going to push you little man we'll put you on me so I finally they pushed me off and I flipped through the air and in the air I think I'm just going to land in the sand and now I'm a take off running\nBig boat or I saw it coming next thing I Know me and my grandmother's house big hole in my head nice speeches later and that was another childhood experience and the other day\nSo here we are now I mean you're somebody in the world of a football and media and entertainment they catch them courses that for every one of you who plays ten

not what it called a teammate or friend on\nEvery NFL team thirty two teams ambassadors you're the ... of the New York giants whoever that may be now we have thirty two million dollars and and what that match from the owners\nI don't think our own or what their business savvy whatever say you know eighty percent of our league is African American and you know these bastards have come up with a

to the concussion on the playground and count and when you were a kid I'm not to count them in the playground part but what football does to your body you have a son who's three now some yeah you're right that you say in this book you don't want him to play football\nI don't want to play football at all but I'm not going to tell him who he is and what do you have to be if he gets to the high school level he's dead I Want to\nPlay football for real like NFL level that's my goal I'm a talk to him and just let them know every level of pain all the emotional rigors and toll it takes on you
