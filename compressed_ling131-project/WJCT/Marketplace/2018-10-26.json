communities right next to each other moving in opposite political directions wealthier Troy work or chow grew up is shifting away from strict Republican\nThe idea that they could be represented by a Democrat\nOr a Democrat state legislature to me a shocking you know these are areas that used to elect their members of the legislature by\nSeventy Seventy five percent for the Republicans\nAnd across the street working class Sterling Heights is becoming less solidly democratic\nI mean that is a chasm of a difference and it's on either side of the road here\nThese shift could determine whether Republicans hold on to the Michigan governor's mansion and it could even influence which party controls the U.S house of representatives All right well let's explore these areas we've walked ... now let's see what lies on either side of it\nFirst we turn left into a community with lots of people like Kathleen van ... she's got a master's degree in a nursing job with a good salary I Love

I'm going to vote for a Democrat\nYes it was the shooting in Florida that high school shooting Marjory Stoneman Douglas yes that way\nAnd I was having lunch with a lot of my nursing school friends and we've all known each other since Nineteen Seventy six we all started nursing school together then\nAnd we were lamenting I said we can't lamenting where we have to do something about that\nWe can't

economic crash and worked as a truck driver for several years he supported Trump in the last election my very\nGood business background or did he was you know we do a lot better for the country not that Obama didn't\nObviously that was a mistake [noise]\nSo you weren't Obama Obama Trump voter yeah and you were reading but officials are now that I look back\nI think a lot of people around here

has transformed the Republican Party with a focus on trade barriers and immigration enforcement [noise]\nHe's also reshaped the coalitions that Republicans and Democrats need to win elections here in Michigan people\nWill cast ballots just over a week from now in a competitive governor's race in several tight congressional races that could determine control of the house the results here could tell

got a Netflix account you know the company has real hard to personalized pretty much everything I get a lot of history stuff suggested some rom coms to to be honest\nSometimes the personalization gets a little bit complicated because there's a difference between stepping personalized and you kind of being profiled Natasha to covers Silicon Valley for wires you wrote about Netflix and what it knows about you and how it shows you what it knows about you and it's actually rubber\nThanks for having me telling me how you came upon the story what'd you\nSure so earlier this month\nWriter named ... brown she posted some artwork that Netflix had served her for a new movie called like fat and she posted this on Twitter so rather than the debt films to white co stars Kelsey grammar and Christian she saw a toaster showing two black side characters who as as brown said had\nMaybe twenty lines between that and towns and brown and black and she asked\nNetflix users if they were experiencing the same phenomenon and she also along with it posted some other artwork that she'd seen for movies like love actually where she was shown black characters who had a very small roles in film\nSo there's there's a part of this that creepy that Netflix is keeping an eye on us which we do kind of know about but also now they're doing this in a uh I get this is kind of a loaded term and they're doing the kind of a bogus way right\nRight well the company's response was that you know they don't ask members without their race gender or ethnicity or they can't use that information to personalize your Netflix experience but they know what we watch right\nYeah exactly they're personalizing it based on your viewing history and and this particular phenomenon happened because last year they started drilling down personalization even to the level of the work that you're seeing\nIn your Netflix queue applying the algorithm to kind of inherently biased database right like Hollywood movies\nDon't offer many parts to people of color and prominent roles so\nNetflix is here and they're just trying to get you to keep watching doing anything they possibly can\nBut what you said is that they you know they should have anticipated this coming and the fact\nThat they can't just be candid about all of the proxies for race that exist in algorithms is just kind of frustrating because here it's it's actually pretty innocuous their algorithms say probably it was just looking at hey can we get people to watch movies based on secondary characters\nYou know they they might not even have taught that in ...\nSecondary characters who go away and the first ten minutes of a movie or whatever so a couple of great things about all that number one Netflix is taking the time effort and energy to personalize their stuff down to the some nail on your screen mhm which seems like a lot of effort I suppose but I guess it works\nYou know once you automate that and you have machine learning doing it it's just kind of sitting on it's on\nThe other part of this though is is we don't know what we don't know because Netflix keeps all of its data extremely closely held\nExactly I mean say they didn't want to answer a question right out these sensitive topics but they wouldn't even tell me okay well what about your viewing history are they cataloging you know what are the factors that they're using um they didn't even feel comfortable sharing not I think they said it's like proprietary information\nIt it's not just what you see on Netflix that algorithms get used for right\nThey are being used in many areas even outside of tech companies there used to determine on you know who gets access to alone they're used for hiring recruitment all kinds of very impactful areas of our lights on

you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\nIn the old school sometimes just about the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server\nBut you know when you need long term archival storage you want something separated from the Internet\nAnd you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in and the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because it's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and stores a heck of a lot of
