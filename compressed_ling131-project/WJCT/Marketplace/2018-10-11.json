said that you looked at that and I drew a gig as a as a way to sort of fade into the sunset\nI'm I'm resilient so\nI Would like to think that I'd always be into something but I Would be a fool if I didn't tell you that the Tonight Show opened up even way more doors than I expected like I I truly thought\nThis was going to be the most gentle mercy killing ever know as I should I [laughter] I'm just glad I'm not ... not ones that I think like oh this could benefit you\nKnow because I've read on the op eds and even though I Love being underestimated huh someone someone had a road in a I'm In a block once like\nLike oh this is a sad day for music because watching the roots\nExcept this uh Tonight Show gig will be like watching Miles Davis bus going to New York some are changing man and I was actually like good actually what I Want I Want to be underestimated 'cause I wanted to I Want it to to kill all a\nPerceptions of this being a square gig or\nDo do you buy the sort of the the conventional wisdom that you've changed late that music\n[noise] um [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media\nHad just started to become a thing something like ... the idea of viral videos was becoming a thing\nAnd we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block and it was clear like Letterman wasn't going to start being on Snapchat and that sort of thing so we just took advantage of and then the playing field you know a lot of late night shows were just post jazz music\nThere there were other avenues to explore and we took full advantage of it\nIt it's interesting because there is a lineage right there's ... from the old Tonight Show and then there's Paul Shaffer ... and others you\nAnd the roots that's weird and you know again like I didn't you know I didn't have posters of ... shaver on my wall like one day that'll be me is just making them most of it again like in two thousand eight when he proposed it to us that\nWe should say you you didn't take the call for a long time yeah I was like a man we just got to to a place where we are making good money on the road like why will return\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably or was that our domestic personal lives kids were getting older crime or at the airport\nSo it was sort of like we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there's a way that we could Celine Dion our way\nInto a position that I like to use all this stuff is verbs right Celine Dion our way into\nA position where we could still make a good living without having to\nHave lobby call for him and be on the bus for nine hours and bad for him in just fell into our lap and it was like be careful what you asked for\nThere's a ... there's going to get old marketplace in and you know ... management on your hair but I live for that stuff well well good and in fact that's the really the question right because you have said more than a couple of points\nPlanning something is the joy of actually doing that something and the question the ... the question that comes out of it is what's it like to work for you how do you run the ban how you run the ... how do you run you guys on the show um\nYou know there's there's lessons to be learned about it because again where we're at a phase in our lives where we're not twenty two twenty three year review or what forty five now yeah of which are okay for early for that but it's a sign of um\nSo the things that I Would like to do like\nYou know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a row in that sort of thing and we used\nTo do you know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that sort of thing not to mention a lot of our side projects\nWell it's weird because on the roots is just one of Nineteen things I'm responsible for we're in a very sweet spot right now where we're actually having more fun with each other\nSocially which is great that we've ever had I realize that we're going to fall
