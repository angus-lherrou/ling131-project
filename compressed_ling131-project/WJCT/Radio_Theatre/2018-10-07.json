with another of this year's MacArthur Foundation fellowship whenever the so called genius grants to to have an Eighteen class includes many artists and scientists and performers and the Reverend William Barber the second Barbara might be best known for his moral Monday protests outside of the state house in North Carolina\nHe was among the first to draw attention to strategies that he said were suppressing the participation of poor and minority voters\nHe's let non violent protests across the country to fight poverty and racism and the Reverend William Barber the second is with us now on the line from North Carolina Thank you so much for joining us congratulations to you thank you so much so how did you react\nWhen you first heard this news said you had been awarded this prize\nWell you know you don't know it's a novice you don't even follow you don't know who central a man they called me up over stopped playing it I thought it was a prank or basically notice for real\nUh then the next thing for me it was two years I thought about all the things that parents have done his sacrifice to all the years of just working and trying to serve it was kind of overwhelming and you know especially when in the work I Do\nA lot of times people are very very nasty and the criticism they say you're doing it for money you're doing it for attention a big question your motives when the reality is you know you just want people to see justice for the ... you want to see people are voting rights and health care\nPeople treated right regardless of their race color creed their sexuality\nTo a gift like this is\nSomebody else sees what you're trying to do what they want to be a part of you continue to do that work\nFor they told me that the ... come out I was actually in custody stand with low wage workers and\nAnd nurses and people working at McDonald's and that's what I was doing\nWe usually think of this grant that goes to people in the science and art will to stimulate creativity [noise] um so so tell me about the role that creativity plays an activism\n[noise] well you know in every age we know what works people gonna make a difference we know the dog by several just read his words we noted protests works we know that voting works but every age is different\nSo you have to face it the way in Eighteen hundred for us so they were just trying to get the right to vote now and then the vaccine six day war tried to hold all the ... all the press on to what we need to get the dog you know\nWe tried to hold on the basic voting rights but we also want to get to where everybody Eighteen is automatically registered they were voting as a holiday where same day registration voting is something that happens in every state\nUh you know years ago people were fighting just to talk about getting out today we've tried to hold onto their father to a form of carrot ad expanded the universal healthcare so it takes it requires a certain understanding of the time\nBut how do you but I'm thinking about things like how do you get people to see these issues in a fresh way which is kind of the essence of creativity I mean some of your techniques like preaching a\nSpeaking writing demonstrating those are classics but you've also done things that are kind of ... like you know give you an example of kind of like a fresh way to get people to look at something that they think that they already understand\nYou know you read mix I mean James Brown was classic soul but rappers ... so what you do is Esther back in the day they had three\nWho's in teaching what what we did with more Monday is and what we do around the country we do something to call but your post a mob political organized leadership Institute in some what we do is we bring people together of all races creed color\nIn classes and we say OK let's look at voter suppression as to the real numbers the Iraq War battle twenty six states we said let's do same states a hot topic these days those same state\nPassed laws against immigrant people and gay people those same states up to bat or a Medicaid expansion those same states did not you'll get right so if you get the same states that passed racialized voter suppression\nAnd the people that get him elected because of racialized voter suppression being used the election to hurt most white people\nAnd most of the poor people and we show people that empirically then they begin to say oh wait a minute we're fighting the same people the same people that are attacking the immigrants that at one of the ... just get the same people that you\nAre the ones that are attacking voting rights and so if they are cynical that's got to be together we have to be smart enough to come together but that is the way in which you read mix if you will what was done in the past and you expand and depressed\nSo before we wrap up here and she mentioned at the outset that this is not a lifetime achievement award this is an investment in you\nTo watch whatever it is you want to do next as you know one of the MacArthur genius grant winters previously with Lin Manuel Miranda who wrote Hamilton so you know no pressure um what what what are you going to do with the ... have you thought about it\nWell I Know what I'm going to do with life and how the grass and changes I don't see in another reason for me to be allowed to have to work on these issues of racism and poverty of ecological devastation that war ...\nAnd and and try to be or what I called Marlin Alice is Marla ticket ... action\nOf deep diving into the poor people's campaign three pairs of the breach the organization I leave my church pastor bring the Christian Church and I don't know the ship if what we do will soul to see a future transformation or if we will see the big ... and the parents tire which media\nWhat I Do know is as for me and buy houses it's good to say we're going to continue to serve this call because we believe that low and justice emerged to those things are important and there's nothing more important than serving\nThe Reverend William Barber the second he's the pastor Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro North
