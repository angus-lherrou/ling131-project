I don't see chair and lioness who had the shots were he was kind of pale and he was in the baby swing and he was swimming in the dark in the living room\nI could kind of see him through the arch way and the darkness and he just felt like he was on the other side of a divide he felt like he was swinging away from me and I got this horrible ... of the stomach feeling I was like you know if\nThat doctor and so I I called her back you know the next day and I was like listen I really want to get him checked out she's like All right we'll get his eyes check before we start doing neurological testing so I made an appointment with an eye doctor\nAnd this was the winter and all of a sudden New York city was hit with this terrible blizzard was two thousand and three December fish and the whole city was just like snowed in with this horrible blizzard in here I was I was going to take this three month old baby in on the subway in a blizzard because I had a bad feeling but I went ahead and I I\nDid it and I got to the doctor's office and they dilated his pupils and the doctor got very very quiet and he disappeared into the back room and he came back\nA business card for um a mandate in Dr Abramson who was the world's leading specialist um in retinal blessed on my very rare kind of cancer\nAnd he said your son has a massive tumor on his retina of his right eye and you need to go get a treated right away and a week later we had started chemotherapy\nI never knew a child so young could even get cancer I'd never heard of anything like this and so my husband and I went into like straightforward battle mode it's like we were going to take care of this we were going to be in control we were going to do everything that we could we went to Sloan Kettering every three weeks they would gas him they would examine it's either they would find a new tumor\nWe go back three more weeks they Ghassan they'd examiners either find another two or three tumors was ultimately Thirteen tumors and all\nAnd I kept looking for answers is like what could cause something like this I Would ask the doctors it's like you know what caused this and it's like nothing cause it's\nSmart melting Lee lovely strong\nAnd she had a fierce belief in the possibility of occasional magic\nAnd I could have married her and I didn't and that was it\nAnd I had no idea what to do I come back on active duty to um spend the second year in Vietnam because I hadn't found a place for myself a in a very changed America when I went back from the first uh and here I was at the end of the second year and still didn't know what to do\n\nNow this sad tale is not just me this is my mother as well we will we raised one another we practically grew up together she was a girl when I was born and then we raised my two younger brothers\nUm this is women have supported me all my life and she heard that only had married another man and she said you stupid boy you stupid\nStupid boy [laughter] and didn't talk to me for several weeks [noise] that's a pretty\nPathetic a figure but this hopelessness I knew what the focus of it was okay and I just had to hold it in\nBecause I couldn't show it to the world I led the ... to Mike for six hundred mountain tribesmen and Seventeen Green Berets and our job was to be the cavalry when special forces camps or along the border areas came under siege\nAnd so they expected me to be steady to be serious and I presented this daily as hard face as I could to the world\n[noise]\nWell I guess that was probably off putting enough that nobody in the gang noticed when I got a letter a letter some of you may not know what a letter is\n[noise]\nIt's what we what we did before Snapchat and Twitter and email and so forth and it came on paper [laughter] I got a letter from the girl told me\nShe said I'm divorced period bang [noise]\nShe said I thought I Would be traveling perhaps in Southeast Asia [noise]\nProbably at the end of August well that happened to be just one of my tour I I'm Sorry the end of October that's exactly when my tour and did and I knew later I mean I sorted out that she had been talking to my mother [noise]\nWell I went into a military precision mode\nI started by getting a car and driver in Bangkok where we're going to me I mean the way she put it let's why not ... let's just meet in Bangkok is if well you know to people who knew each other vaguely would go to the oriental hotel and have tea\nYou know but I knew this was serious for her yeah and so I Want to make everything just right but the timing was a crucial element because this is a woman who hadn't had in the years I had known her ten dollars per se I mean the same ten dollars at one time\nAnd I do if she managed somehow to buy this ticket to Bangkok\nThat she was going to arrive broke and so I had to be there and so I'm not planning on time was meticulous I figured out how long would take I had one day for every movement every time I had to change planes every time I had to walk across the street we add a day I'm going to get their forties early as my target is four days early and then I threw it in another three days\n[noise] look I'm playing for my life here [noise]\nUh so uh and then very quickly you know we're getting into the the middle of October\nAnd the the fellow who's really they may has reported for duty and I've signed over the equipment weapons to him a we've shaken hands it's essentially done and I don't get out the door quite fast enough with a message comes in and says one of our post\nA on the lotion border has come under siege and we have to go do our part to save them\nOr I could have left but in truth none of none of my guys expected me too because the new guy didn't even know everyone's name yet and you can't really expect in March off to war or when he's just hey you sort of sort of relationships so I put down my pack bags and went back to the war\nUm we went up to the camp or it was an ugly bit of business or they were being shelled by heavy mortars and artillery um and we push back the foreign observers the eyes and ears of the artillery and then we went after the guns themselves and eventually it was all over\nAnd I had a day left um but I rushed to an airplane um\nWithout being on the manifest against the rules and got down to Saigon and I had one day to find a way to Bangkok\nI was five days till the next commercial flights when across in three days until the embassy courier flight went to Bangkok and at the end of a long and very frustrating day arguably the darkest day of my life\nA guy said captain you can't get there by the twenty eighth even if you hijack an airplane [noise]\nI felt like I couldn't worries I felt like I had somehow been hit with something and so I went to the special forces club [noise]\nThe bar there or was open seven days a week twenty four hours a day for eight years\nAnd I went there and I had a lot of money in my genes I was you know and so I drank good scotch and after three after three scotch as generously port\nA it came to me I could fix this I was going to drink myself to death in that bar\nI taught myself you're not leaving here until they carry you out dead and just as I started into\nThat mode in through the door comes more three Maggie re the patron saint of the Green Berets now some of you may not know who Martha Ray is\nOr was um [noise]\nShe was born in Nineteen sixty\nOr by Nineteen Twenty one she was a headliner in vaudeville she made her first movie in Nineteen thirty four made thirty more of them are three times with Bob Hope but my favorite movie most server do or she played with Charlie Chaplin she acted him right off the screen through the entire movie\nAnd he was the director and producer\nSo Megan came in and she and I had known each other since the beginning of that second tour might\nAnd and we had a good relationship we had shared common interest we'd like good coffee and vodka and movies and we spend a lot of time talking about that well she walked in surveyed her domain there I'm Maggie a you know had been there six months a year for seven years\nAnd it wasn't that do shows and it wasn't to promote herself or her career or anything she just came and largely just hung around with the guys with the Green Berets she was a cheerleader she was our confidant\nWell she walked in as I say she surveyed heard domain and then she looked at me and she sat down in order to drink and gave me a huge stage frown tap my hand and said Larry what's\nOh I said maybe I've just screwed up my whole life there's one girl she's going to be in Bangkok I'm not going to be able to get there I don't know what I'm gonna do\nI I've just ruined everything I was just completely follow this whole thing up and I said she's gonna arrive in Bangkok she's going to be broke she's going to wait a day maybe two and then she's going to have to go home\n\nAnd Maggie thought about it for a minute he's she said Larry are you sure that this girl is that important\n'cause there are an awful lot of ways to have fun in this world without you know just invent yourself all over again I said no baggage she's absolutely the girl I Want the girl I knew the girl I Want to marry that this is this is everything she's it\nAnd she gave me another pause and then she said we'll fix this we're going to go tomorrow and see the head of the seven the air force it's a four star general and we're going to fix this will get you a ride to get in Bangkok on time\nAnd so I went to the to my room and woke up and ten minutes later the adrenaline NBA burned off all the hangover and I was ready for the day and I marched out to uh to uh meet Maggie and off we went to see the head of the seventh Airforce\nWe walked into the building at ... airfield that said headquarters seventh Airforce through the door and there are signs that say executive suites this direction maybe understood that the real head of the seven third force was not the four star general\nWho got in the pictures it was a senior noncommissioned officer who really ran the place command master\nSergeant Francis Patrick my honey not Mahoney dear God no mom honey [noise]\nAnd so [noise]\nMy honey operates in a huge bay of ... of people doing busy and important work in a sort of Plexiglas cube\nThat's his office so he can see in every direction and I'm left to sit outside Maggie is received like royalty inside and she her just to ... get Wilder and Wilder's he's pointing over her shoulder may\nBut my honeys head is slowly turning this way and what was a smile is turn to a oh my God\n[noise] um [noise] and the issue is in real doubt I can tell because Maggie cries OK Maggie only cried on cue [noise]", "year": "2018",
