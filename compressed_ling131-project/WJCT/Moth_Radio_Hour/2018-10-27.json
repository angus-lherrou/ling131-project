Todd flew out to Portland and I drove down to visit him and I stopped in this casino on the way to check it out as a new place had just opened a couple of months earlier\nAnd they happened to have a shuffle that was imperfect it was interesting it didn't sufficiently randomized the car so I sat down and I attacked the shuffle the first day I got there\nAre lots of ... which is normal ...\nWent to Portland, Oregon and soft hot and you know we order the route of drinks and he said how are you doing what have you been up to you and I said well you know I Am good yeah a little this little that I've been playing a little bit of blackjack and I could tell this question sort of forming\nA in his in his mind and he he he he was wondering I knew he was wondering you know what Black Jack how like what does this mean ... contact with a team with other people are you on your life so I just preempted the entire thing and I said you know on my own my own bank roll my own money just a little bit of play and he was silent\n\nAnd I felt so\nAngry at him\nAnd threw him at everybody else who he was representing all my friends the people who loved me my mom and dad\nThese all these people who I was you know I'd basically been keeping a pretty quiet it was playing a little cards on the side\nAnd the thing is that there is a dark side and a light side in gambling\nAnd I had thoroughly explored\nBoth sides I knew\nThe difference\nBut the difficult thing about advantage game they're gambling with an edge is that this this situations that emerge when you're doing that and the certain circumstances that come up and the stories that you come back with are so far out an extravagant and frankly incredible that if you admit any vulnerability or any uncertainty\nAbout what it is that you are doing\nIn a casino nobody will believe you\nThat you have an edge they won't see you as this thing that you are representing yourself as they will see you as the stone cold opposite of that\nAnd so I didn't talk about it more I ordered the next round we drank the next day I was hung over back in the casino and the shovel as I say it was not random it's what you call a sequential shuffle and and it's a quaint little shuffle everything you see\nComes back to you again it's essentially a shuffle where it is possible to identify with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact moment\nA specific individual cards are going to appear that's a little bit different from ordinary card counting it's very cool and this game had an additional feature was which is that besides just thinking ordinary blackjack and they had a sign that attached to the blackjack game called the lucky ladies\nAnd the lucky lady side but your place that right next year blackjack and if you were dealt\nA queen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts that would pay off at a hundred to one and when I saw it I knew immediately this makes sense what he wants to do in this game is to sequence the leading secrets to queens hearts they're only six of them in the death but they're very very valuable and so for the previous day and a half\nI'd been up betting for queens of hearts and I caught a few but then nothing ever lined up in his way to win the jackpot but I was ... that was tough and I had a significant edge\nDoing this and suddenly at this moment the man next to me was actually dealt the hand of hands screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and what that means is that there's a good likelihood that those two cards are going to appear within reasonable proximity of each other again\nAfter the chef and so I sequence that I've burned\nAnd image into my head sequencing is Monica technique and use visual monitor you associate people from your life with each card and put them in a scene to remember the order and so I burn this image and has the either was shuffling\nI was alone and the small casino in a remote place but I wasn't entirely alone because in front of me in my mind where these images of the people that I use when sequencing and they were all my old ... college so I saw these prosperous ...\nA kind of brilliant people that I always held in such a floating passed me and I also I was not alone in a literal sense because next to me at the table was this other guy who'd been in the casino all morning this was a Wednesday morning for hours\nGambling and he had that same glaze look at the people I used to sit across the table from it gamblers anonymous meetings hat\nAnd the dealer finished shuffling and started to deal and I\nSaw the cars come out that indicated the queen's we're in theory do and I placed to bad people maximum at this place it was three hundred dollars on two consecutive lucky lady squares and\nSure enough for the first round one queen of heart was dealt on one of my best which had happened a number of times before I'd never won anything from it so I didn't get too excited the dealer kept going around in the second round on top of my queen of hearts she put another queen of hearts and then she stops\nAnd she looked at the table and she called over the ... and he came and she looked at the table\nAnd\nWould they eventually figure it out with something I already knew which is that a hundred times a three hundred dollar wager pays thirty thousand dollars and around the time they figured that out I absorbed the notion that I had in fact just one that amount and in fact in the turn of a single card on one\nHand had gone within crying distance of is fifty thousand dollar not I was trying to recover\nEventually\nSomewhat but grudgingly\nI took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had\nWas the first punishment then the second punishment was I was sent to live with my mother's sister my aunt um because I didn't like my brother they said and uh I was\n... or put on a boat with my little release with my little things in it um I was put on a boat it so happened to be the very boat on which the angry letters went back and forth and uh it's quite possible that I was a letter myself [noise]\nUm [noise]\nI when I arrived in Domenico I'm a Dominique incidentally is named uh because Christopher Columbus discovered it on a Sunday so its name Dominique he had by that time run out of names he\nLikes that [noise]\nIn any case when I go to this island it was very strange my mother had told me about her growing up you know various um\nThings but I thought that the only ... these things only happened to my mother the ah carrying a snake on knowing lead to her on her head for many miles these sort of thing would only happen or to my mother or\nHer description of fish that flew in or out of the water this would only happen to her\nBut it turns out that Dominique it was just as she described it and um which is why she fled from it it rained [noise]\nIt's rained all the time or the beaches had no standard they had ... black pebbles because the island is volcanic are formed from a new one volcano\nUm and uh the skies were not great there was water everywhere where as anti ... as you well know because you've been there on your holiday and it never rains it has beautiful beaches I'm a boost the end and especially blue sky [noise]\nUh and uh so Domenico was the opposite of this place that I had just been banished from [noise]\nUm I'm divorced my aunt was in there to meet me on the on the on the Jackie uh somehow I was taken to her house and where my grandparents also live in my whole ...\nAnd there I met my aunt who was the complete opposite of my mother for one thing she had red hair and gray eyes and that's when I first came to realize that my mother was something called a Richards and um they have that\nMark read here in gray eyes and also my aunt seemed incredibly cost me she didn't have my mother\nGraceful ways my mother incidentally had long black hair she took off to the ... side of her ... her family\nAnd um she was very graceful and very um even though we were very pool where she had very bourgeois ways we ate with napkins and knife and fork and and spoke properly and so and my aunt was the opposite of that\nAnd um I naturally you know missed my mother very much and um I couldn't understand my management\nAh I began to write to my mother\nThings that were not true I Would say that my aunt had mystery to me um had denied me food ah had um made me go without sleep all sorts of things that were not true ah\nAnd then I Would food the letters up and uh take them to come with me out of the yard on my way to school um which was five miles away from my house in a village called ...\n... really massacre but it has a whole other starring which I'll save for another time\nIn any case I Would put the letters ... ah just outside the gate I never posted them I had no way of posting them\nAnd they were all the same you know Jim mommy I miss you so much and I'm very badly treated they give me new food they treat me like a dog all of it completely on true um but then I Would for them up and put them uh uh owned the stone and then walk off to school\nApparently one day my aunts or me do this I'm without my known she saw me secrete these uh pieces of paper under a stone\nAnd ah she let me go off to school but she retrieve them and uh when I returned that afternoon from school or the letters were on a table\nAnd ah there was this red haired degree I'd woman in flames are\nA at me angry at me and um I think I cried and said I was already and so on a bus in any case it didn't matter uh she packed up my things and the next time the boat to\nA arrived it was called the envy report and the next time it arrived she put me on it and sent me back to my mother which is just what I wanted I wanted to go back to\nAh my mother and so I arrived in Ninety ... and are waiting for me at all on the pier was ah\nAh my mother and ah I was very happy to see her\nExcept that yes she had another child
