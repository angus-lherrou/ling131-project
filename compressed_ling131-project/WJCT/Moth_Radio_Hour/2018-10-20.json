I did not think you could do that\nAnd on bat day I'm proud to say that I earned Richards respect [noise]\nAnd I got to tell you wasn't worth it should not have done that\nAnd I started to really love all parts of Missouri and after a while we started to get a pretty big Muslim population in southwest Missouri and the reason why it's hard to these big issue down there and most of them to go to med school so\nWe're like we got you baby [noise]\nAnd we started to get such a big Muslim population in the area that we're able to open up our own mosque in Joplin, Missouri [noise] yeah [noise]\nAnd it was a super important place for us because not only would people be able to practice their religion we finally had a space to do that but it was important for us to have a sense of community like there were little girls and little boys who had actually\nSpoke with axon or who were hit jobs headscarves than to class and in rural Missouri that was very hard for them so a lot of them didn't have the confidence to speak up\nBut by having a mosque there to teach people public speaking and allow them to express their identity out they see fit they started to get braver and they started to get more proactive in classes and the place mattered\nTo them and it was great having the mosque in my home town then I went to college on the east coast and I was just poking around and I wanted to see how the Mona cubs high school football team was projected to do in the upcoming season so I pull up the local newspaper website\nDropping globe and the headline read Joplin ... mosque burned to the ground\nAnd it was during Ramadan\nAnd I knew that my parents were there the night before and I couldn't allow myself to think of the reality that might have happened so I pick up my phone and I called my dad and the phone rang and rang and there was no answer\nAnd then I called my mom and my sister and my brother no response I kept calling throughout the night and finally at six in the morning my dad picks up he was like hello how are you alive\nBecause like yeah I think the phone call settled bit\nAnd I told them at the mosque I'd been burned down and he said that he left before anything like that happened and he doesn't want to call and make sure that everyone was All right and they were\nAnd I would later watch\nThe security camera footage of this because we knew that something bad like this might happen and you see\nA face in black and white look up\nAt the camera you could see his eyes extra white and he smiled\nAnd then he turned back down in the next thing you saw was flames burning the building and I knew that we could not rebuilt this mosque\nBecause no matter how much it meant to our community no matter how much good as it did it was worth nobody's life\nCertainly not my family and so with that in mind I pledge to make sure that no one\nWould rebuild this mask so then I came home over break\nAnd I asked my dad to take me to black cat lane which is where the mosque used to stand and the entire building had been burned to the ground and the only thing left was a mailbox and in that mailbox is a letter addressed to the Muslim\nA few years before the mosque was burned down Joplin, Missouri had the worst tornado and basically American history leveled the town and to try to help out the Muslims in the community opened up a free clinic so people because you are with so backed up it was helpful to have a free clinic\nFor more minor ones and that letter said\nWhen the tornado struck\nI had nowhere to go no one would take my daughter and my wife but you did I don't understand you\nKnow I don't understand your religion but what I Do understand this stuff is that when we needed you you were there for us but when you needed us\nWe weren't there for you\nBeing a Muslim in Missouri means that you have to endure things that you never thought you would have to him that no one should\nBut I learned that day that it matters and it's worth it\nAnd so we keep trying again [noise]\nAsk for the Muslim community and very continues to thrive the mosque was rebuilt and the good deeds continue after\nThe fire many of the local churches and synagogues gather to support the Muslim community Omar said that is typical Missouri he still loves to play\nHowever and um I was sad to learn that hog wild home of the eight pound nacho challenge has closed its doors but we were able to get a copy of all my picture displayed on the wall after his Victorian meal you can see it at the mosque that Oregon\nBut when we return to stories of love
