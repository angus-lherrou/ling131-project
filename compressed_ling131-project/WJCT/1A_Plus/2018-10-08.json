Bush come out after\nAt Thomas was confirmed and say that he hoped the country could now he'll from this vicious battle and you had Clarence Thomas himself come out I'm at his home and strike the same note at\nTrump I people may have noticed is not a unifying president he's a divider and he thrives on a defensiveness so this was exactly the sort of battle that that he really thrives on\nAnd and he uh notably did not come out after Kavanaugh is confirmed and say he hopes this can be a time for healing he was a he turned instead to his base\nSo I don't think that there's going to be a healing from this I think each side is going to turn to its base and try to get them to turn out for the midterms and I think that's because we're in a different era and we're in an area where we have a president\nWho is a base politician I not somebody who turns to the middle\nI Know we have to pause in the moment but worth noting you notice that this was one of those where you know Republican senators really didn't need to play very nice for the Democrats as long as they didn't lose many votes they basically had the votes they needed to confirm kind of wherever they want\n'em that's true but it ignores the the block of moderates on on the Republican side and actually what I think was interesting to note uh both interesting column speech and in the way that Lindsey Graham has been talking for the last few days and\nI think it's important to note that they've been pointing to the process like the process has raged on the way that Democrats on the committee had behaved\nHas enrage them um and I wonder if that is going to damage those relationships between Republican moderates and their friends on the other side of the aisle going forward because we don't I mean when the ground is not like a a service base firing up Republican million by the time he's he's a moderate\nAnd to hear the moderate saying hey we really didn't like how this went down and it's my damage at going forward\nWill continue our conversation and get some more of your thoughts in just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a firm W.

A. M. U. dot org and we're always checking or phone voicemail at eight five five to three six one a one a\nUm but I Do want to kind of circle back just a little bit to this question of leaving aside the standard of evidence\nOr the the sort of process element of this I I think that um when we talk about believability there were a lot of Americans who watch those hearings who believe Dr Ford when she testified and then heard from Brett Kavanaugh and said no she's mistaken\nAnd done that in itself shows the importance outside of a courtroom setting in a cultural setting and in in the court of public opinion of at least some kind of fair process where both sides are heard right because I think think about all of the Americans who had their minds changed by Brett Kavanaugh's testimony after Dr for its\nUm and and I I really think that's the idea about his temperament on that played really really different than going back to what Mona said before\nWe have two completely different world views here on the left they saw an angry man I mean there were some suggestions I thought a very unfair suggestions like oh we see how he is now he gets angry he's probably an angry drunk and\nThen of course it was cold open with Matt Damon playing a Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd on the right I think that saved then\nUm I think that after a doctor for his testimony I think there were a lot of Republicans who thought okay she seems believable I don't want to use the word credible because I think that requires evidence but she seems believable or her story seems plausible\nAnd he came back and they saw the righteous anger or the man who's seen\nHis decades of reputation on you know come crumbling down over false allegations on and and I think that that idea that a man should have to sit and listen to allegations that he takes gang rape is without any evidence that that actually sonic offered\nAnd it's kind of ludicrous like I think we would all be angry I don't think it speaks to the judicial temperament fortunately judges don't ruin their own cases that's why they ...\nTom Joshua Johnson you listen you're listening to one a\nFew more of your comments now Dan in Rochester emailed\nI'm a

term Obama voter and slowly woke up to what I saw a bunch of wise and\nVoted for Trump this last time and I got to say that this whole Cavanaugh I'm debacle really this would be a second awakening for me and a lot of people I've talked to it really has been it's been ugly from both sides but\nMainly from the left and I think it's really going to swing badly for liberals in the midterm\nLogan thanks very much for calling in and Morsi also thanks for sharing your thoughts with us ...\nYeah so the caller raises an incredibly important to point that we haven't gotten to yet but that's the I'm sort of cultural moment here about the me too movement because as somebody who I'm I was very well disposed towards the me too movement of right from the beginning I think it's a necessary corrective\nI'm On the other hand it seems in this case to have been weaponized for political outcome\nAnd the standard that the me too movement or at least some advocates of it and the Democrats seem to want to establish is that an accusation by itself without evidence is enough to sink a man's career ruin his reputation\nAnd a lot of people are rightly Rick oiling at that and saying that cannot be the standard yes we have to listen to women respectfully when they come forward and accuse someone that that doesn't mean that accusation alone is enough\nI Wonder though if there's any way to even separate those things I mean I think about\nThat moment when Jeff Flake was on his way down the elevator remember that when I was in office buildings on the fourth floor he's trying to get the second floor and those women held the door open anywhere like look at me when I'm Talking to you what do you do I was a survivor of look what you're doing to me\nFinally went down and created a compromise with senator with democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware it feels like this is so personal it couldn't be anything but political when she was like this is where the rubber meets the road I mean even Taylor Swift has come out against\nMarsha Blackburn for the Democrats as a result of all of us I mean he was part of what I was in the south part of what you put it on where we are that's where we haven't heard from ... oh not even a minute here's part of what\nTell us with wrote on Instagram quote so many intelligence thoughtful self possessed people have turned Eighteen and the past two

unquote I mean\nJust feels like the kind of thing that just shows visceral that it's just designed to mobilize people to political ... okay\nSo here's the thing every piece that I've read or or testimonial that I've seen the last few weeks ago about I was raped or I was sexually assaulted therefore I Believe that Kavanaugh did this\nThat's the the the the link that's in my opinion really dangerous right because of course so many women have been victims that doesn't mean this man is guilty I've compared it to any time that you judge people by the group they belong to right we're going to judge Kavanaugh because he's a man I mean we could say the same thing about\nYou know young African American male is arrested for bank robbery and uh you know you could say well you know young African American males are disproportionately ah caught bank robbing banks so therefore this guy must be guilty that's not the way our justice system works\nOut I think you're ... I I think that the emails and the cause you reading that this is something that's absolutely going to mobilize the left and I do think that because Kavanaugh was confirmed\nAt the right may suffer from this at the ballot box however I think that Republicans will happily sacrifice ten Fifteen twenty twenty five house seats\nFor a seat on the Supreme Court and that judges are simply a winning issue for conservatives and they will happily pay a political cost to have at adjust\nThis cabinet rather than a defeated judge Kavanaugh\nSeen as I Know you want to jumping on that'll give me a chance to do that as soon as we come back I also want to talk about what this might mean for the court itself Irwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll Kevin ... really took the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some say she will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate\nWhat will she actually mean for the Supreme Court [noise]\n[noise]\nHi I'm ...

was another big conversation that kind of got eclipse by all of this\nThis time about law enforcement you may have heard that a Chicago police officer is awaiting sentencing on second degree murder charges in the high profile shooting of a black teenager officer Jason Van Dyke who is white was convicted of second degree murder for killing that teen le Kuan McDonald\nTrainer appreciate your calling and thanks for talking to us I Wonder earlier on uh what do you make of James comments or heard what you said earlier in terms of these votes these confirmation votes getting narrower and narrower but you know in spring court has always been so I'm thinking of a political football to varying degrees basically throughout American history\n[noise] you know Mona made a comment at the beginning of the show that I think was a spot on that uh I think as Congress has sort of abdicated its role as a\nUh the legislative body the Supreme Court has kind of stepped in to play that role a ruling on sort of the hot button political issues of the day and as a result has become a real political football with every nomination being hotly contested\nAnd I think it is likely to stay that way because people have a sense and I think a correct sense that the Supreme Court it uh plays an enormous role over the shape of the country and and the political shape of the country\nAnd that's really the role of Congress should plan but Congress is not playing that role of Congress and the state legislators are not playing that role to the extent that they should be and as a result uh people perceived the court correctly as a an increasingly a political body\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nYou know is um I I absolutely agree with that we ought to uh we hadn't been made political by this nomination and in fact we saw Ben faster than south that exact point prior to all these allegations and the normal a hearing portion of the confirmation battle\nA saying hey these protesters shouldn't be in front of the Supreme Court they should be in front of Congress Congress has has totally abandoned its role as as the legislature and has increasingly shifted off that role either to the Supreme Court or to the executive agencies and and that's just a very I think long term problematic\nDevelopment of day that if I can just jump in let's bear in mind why they're doing this\nCongress is doing this out of cowardice right because they don't want to act ... they're protecting their own interests they don't want to have to take tough votes and alienated some of their constituents and so they want to push off the power to other people this is the two other branches of government\nLet me get to one more voice mail that we asked regarding your thoughts about how about this process and what impact it has on you here's one more listener who left in ... in our inbox\nHi my name is ... and I'm calling from Cleveland I Am a conservative registered Republican I'm and I\nI support Dr Ford hundred percent I think this should not be an issue which divides Republicans and Democrats [noise] I'm\nA salt is never okay it's never OK to cross someone's boundaries without their permission um and that is what I'm teaching my two elementary school children I think that's a learning tool and I also looked like at at the age of forty two I remember\nBeing in college um and\nA date rape was something that did happen and women often felt shame because they felt as though they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and the man hit that carried away um that is why knowing history and where we and I support Dr Ford\nLipsticks very much for calling in and I wonder if loses comment kind of gives us a way to wrap up this conversation in terms of the conversation that happens now we've heard from a number of listeners in terms of the discussion that they're having with their kids particularly boys to your mom's of boys who are talking about this\nHere's a bit of what David Mark is New York correspondent for the federal is rooted in today's New York times David writes quote the tests\nFor conservatives in the wake of these ugly two weeks is not to point and laugh\nBut to show care and compassion that may build trust him Mr Kavanaugh and the court among those who so bitterly and sincerely opposed him\nThere's plenty of blame for the tribalism in our country to go around\nEnding it however is a task best undertaken by the side that is winning unquote that's part of what they would mark and she was in New York based correspondent for the federalist wrote in today's New York times I Wonder where we see that conversation happening if we see that conversation happening and and what that might look like ...\nYeah I um [noise] I just wrote a book I'm all about some of these matters um uh it's called sex matters and it's a please really for us to grapple better with what's gone wrong between men and women what's gone wrong with the sexual ecosystem that we've created in the wake\nOf the sexual revolution where the rules are not clear at all about how to behave and we're\n... honestly I think we could find some common ground between me too and feminism and social conservatism because we all agree that bad male behavior is a scourge and that it has become all too common\nUm the question is whether we can see that as the um as a unifying issue and and the women and men of goodwill from both sides can look for reforms of how we're socializing children\nYou know just briefly before we go where do you see the conversation going\nUm well I think that's an interesting point that ... motivate I think there might be some common ground there on ... and a full disclosure Davis a friend of mine a and a colleague at the federalist on\nI I think it's going to be difficult though I think Republicans look at the weight of this hearing was handled not necessarily a doctor for herself and in fact I Would point out that on the Republicans on the committee work quite respectful that the hearing was respectful they gave her a full opportunity to speak they did not know harshly question her they had um a prosecutor\nAny sexual assault I'm\nNo expert washing her quite gently on and actually I think that is to to the that is perhaps and on a positive note that is something we I think have moved forward on in the culture at that you know sexual assault victims should be heard that doesn't necessarily mean we take their word as the final say on what happens over to a man's life\nYou know step and

other journalism bloggers not to do the same so there's a kind of a chilling effect that's created by cracking down on individual journalists\nAnd you know I'm looking at the list at least as of the twenty Fifteen version of the ten most censored countries Saudi Arabia is third North Korea is second and in first place is Eritrea\nWe're speaking to Rob Mahoney the deputy director of the committee to protect journalists this is a story that's been on some of your mind says well Tacoma twenty two deep tweeted I'm absolutely horrified by the atrocity that may have been perpetrated on Mr ... she by Saudi Arabia\nIs this in part a result of the u._s. abandoning human rights advocacy and then building authoritarian regimes I pray Mr ... is against all odds alive\nRob I Wonder how you would respond to that I don't think the u._s. has really been particularly heavy on Saudi Arabia on its human rights record for an array of reasons that may have to do with oil and with our military\nYeah absolutely I mean you know a Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally of the United states and many Western European countries it also happens to by tens of billions of dollars of defense equipment and I'm from the U.S\nAnd is able to act as a bulwark against Iran and the region as far as the U.S is concerned so it's had especially under the current administration a pass on human rights in fact President Trump if you remember that picture of him holding a Golden Globe at at an exhibition last year in a\nIn Saudi Arabia with the king and with the a president of Egypt\nWhere the Saudi Arabia is portraying itself as a Martin and reforming nation uh this year the crown prince as a lot of people to go to the cinema\nAnd allowed women to drive but all the women that campaigned\nFor the right to drive a car have being silenced or have been jailed in other words\nThe king the crown prince does not want it to be seen that he changed his mind and relax some of the controls because of pressure from groups of activists women\nKnow he wants to be that he gave it to the ... to the country as a gift\nSo there is there is no room for meaningful political dissent or meaningful independent and critical voices whether journalists so human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia under the new crown prince\nSo what happens now what's the next step in this saga that we should be keeping an eye out for\nWell we need a countries like the United states that you pay and other countries that have influence what ties with Saudi Arabia to demand answers and this particular case\nPhoto journalist ...\nWhere is the what has happened to him you say he's not in the consulate well he was last seen in your constantly wherever they say we need a secular state Pompeo and others start asking those questions even if they're uncomfortable for our allies in the Gulf\nI just want to get to the rest of that list I Know some of you may be curious what the other seven countries are on the ... list of the ten most censored country's ever trace first the north Korea than Saudi Arabia force is Ethiopia then Azerbaijan Vietnam Iran\nEight is China ninth is Myanmar intense\nIs Cuba and one of the things that you know\nIn this list is that imprisonment is the most effective form of intimidation harassment that's used this would seem to be an escalation if Mr ... has been killed as opposed to jailed\nYes it would be a very very disturbing escalation because you now have\nExtra territorial extrajudicial killing if that is in fact the case um murder of journalists is quite common in many countries even here on our own border in Mexico we have\nNumerous assassinations of journalists that have crossed organized crime for example\nBut we've not seen it uh as as a weapon of repression and many of the middle east countries for a long time jailing has been the ah the weapon of choice to silence critical journalist so that if it is true\nThat he was killed in that a consulate that this would be a very very disturbing escalation\nI Wonder if by way of wrapping up the conversation if you give us a sense of kind of where press freedom stands around the globe I mean we mentioned two days ago this female journalist Victoria Marin over\nWho was killed in Bulgaria journalist just don't die for their work in the U.S last time I can remember a journalist being killed here with Sean see Bailey in two thousand seven in Oakland and there was such outrage the journalist from every other news organization got together and finished his corruption report for him and got the people involved in his murder thrown in jail\nThis just isn't something we feel in a country where we revere as a First Amendment I mean that is what one a our program is named after the first amendment\nBefore we let you go do do you have a ...\nCan you give us just a better sense as Americans of what we should be thinking right now in terms of press freedom around the globe especially because quite often we take it for granted here\nYeah we need to talk of we need to defend the values that are on board he's in the first amendment\nAnd the rule of law I'm One of the ways that you do that is by making sure your own houses in order so it's extremely disturbing to me when I see the press being undermined\nBy the kind of corrosive rhetoric that we now get in the political debate here where journalists mocked that their work is belittled and their role as the guardians of democracy is total is is totally dismissed\nSo let's get our own house in order to make sure that we're defending press freedom and the rights of the media here and then we can work to try to improve things overseas\nAnd indeed we didn't have that shooting this summer in Maryland at the offices of the capital Gazette as well Rob Mahoney the deputy director of the committee to protect journalists Rob thanks for talking to us thank you is is a pleasure coming up we'll talk about what's happening at

that means it's time for our special series the state where in about legislative trends at the state level\nNext month in the midterms four states have ballot initiatives that would change how they draw voting districts instead of lawmakers drawing their own lines independent redistricting commissions would take over Twenty one states already have these commissions\nYeah so we were looking at we there's really three options to go about this at least in Michigan one was they could have brought a lawsuit um but actually the legal limit voters\nQuickly after we were kind of thinking about it they ended up bringing a lawsuit against the current maps and really lawsuits are great because they will help 'em right any wrongs that were done but it doesn't change who's drawing the lines\nAnd I really think unless you get politicians out of the driver's seat for these decisions you're always going to have a conflict of interests that is putting\nPartisan politics above the actual people love your state and so then we were like okay well let's try and see if we could work with the legislature and after doing some research we saw that there had been over a lead then bills actually written on a by different members and our Congress but\nThey were either only written by Republicans are only written by Democrats depending who had been doing the most recent gerrymandering\nAnd none of them had ever even been adopted up into a vote so he's pretty quickly that that was not a good rap to go um so then I think a lot of us really felt like we are tired of compromise um\nPoliticians don't have a large incentive to give themselves less power\nSo if we're gonna make this systemic change that it really does have to come for and by the people of our state because otherwise it's going to be a solution that just continues on putting power at\n'em with politicians are special interests instead of the actual people so it's really been amazing though I mean we had thousands of people to get these town halls thirty three and thirty three days where we went\nAnd talked to people about what is gerrymandering what does it look like in Michigan what does it look like in other states and then we had a big long survey asking people their preferences and who do you think should draw these lines and how how should we be drawing the districts what kind of data should be used and then how do you want the process to look\nAnd it really has been um a statewide effort and all eighty three counties and Michigan which has been a really inspiring a thing to be a part of\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a repulsive can you walk us through the ballot measures in four states they would be changing or they were charged independent commissions with redistricting instead of legislators can you just quickly kind of run through what those for initiatives are\nYeah so the four strays you talked to Katie in Michigan Missouri has something on the ballot to Colorado and Utah are the two other states and by and large the\nUm the contours of these ballot measures are largely the same they would create independent commissions you know that there are differences on on the margins in terms of the number of people on the commission's or how they're appointed or things like that\nBut those collisions would include some Democrats some Republicans and crucially or independent or unaffiliated voters and in most cases those unaffiliated voters after vote with the the a super majority which would probably include at least some members from the minority party too so that everybody\nHas a stake in the final maps and and the point is to ah pass maps that at least pass muster with some members of both parties are in order to come up with some kind of\nA comprehensive an unfair process that's what's happened in Ohio earlier this year that you mentioned\nThat's the really the the template that Arizona and California the two real pioneers in this independent commission did in about a decade ago would have more than a decade ago now uh but uh after the two thousands when when the first real effort to reform this came up and or we're seeing that in\nOur efforts to do this in most states where there are aware ballot measures are ah are are allowed to wear citizens are allowed to put measures on the ballot or they're at least some rumblings about other initiatives of this type or coming up in\nFuture years David it seems like one of the challenges with making these commissions is what the composition of them would be whether they are non partisan or bipartisan or independent just\nWho gets to be on them and how those people are appointed and comedy terms they serve and who gets to put them on and take them off I I Wonder what you see in terms of ... the the nitty gritty of how these commissions come together and what the party compositions of them are and what impact that\nI think that's exactly right these commissions really are only as good as the people who serve on them the way that they're chosen and then the criteria that they are given to do their work\nAnd what you see in many states where\nThe commissions are essentially um appointed by the political process so so say a bipartisan commission that works in in Washington state or in New Jersey at these are essentially incumbent\nProtection gerrymandered these are both parties that are coming together in a dividing up the seat\nYou also have the example of Arizona which I think is you know really instructive because it was it was passed is a nonpartisan commission except the way that they constituted it um you have Democrats essentially picking two members Republicans picking two members so immediately\nYou have you know for fierce partisans at loggerheads on commission and then there's one independent chair who is chosen through the state of ... court a personal process so the goal is to try to find an independent\nUm except Republican glass on the Democratic founded way do you know I work a Trojan Horse Democrat onto the onto the panel who voted along side\nOr the ... the two liberals\nAnd created a set of math that have been better for the Democrats this decade than for the Republicans whether or not that's actually true or leave it and they're determined to work the same process in twenty twenty and to try to you know game that process you know\nRight there at the independent chair level so if you only have five person commission at four people are partisans you are going to not get a super good process out of this\nSo they all did we were I Know we're coming up to a break I hate to cut you short and we're having a little bit of a glitch in his own your ally not your fault but we'll learn that out during the break but it sounds like what you're saying is that\nYou have these nonpartisan commissions were they basically appoint bureaucrats to draw the lines than these bipartisan commission's where existing partisans try to work their differences out and then you have a place like California where the goal is to kind of in power citizens to draw the districts and stuff\nI think that's exactly right California and these other initiatives this year as well you know Colorado and Michigan are trying to find actual citizens to do this and California certainly prove that after all citizens can do this and do it really well\nWe'll continue our conversation in just a moment with David daily senior fellow at fair vote read Wilson national correspondent for the hill and Katie ... founder and
