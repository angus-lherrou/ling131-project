like over in a way [laughter] but I tell me about it\nThat's right and it is a great program and it's a it's been in existence for forty three years believe it or not it's a the council on aging or our beaches Council on aging as a small\nNonprofit were primarily known for the transportation program dollar ride\nAnd uh we provide over five hundred seniors per year individually identified with about almost five thousand trips or year for\nFor medical appointments grocery store pharmacy a heron nail salon and even social engagement for art theatre whatever they\nKnew that they need and if you are free to them\nIt's it's it is if\nThey needed to be free we do ask for a five dollar donation per round trip but we don't turn anybody\nDown that's a good deal yeah and this is for seniors at the beaches that just for whatever reason can't drive themselves anymore it exactly one of the biggest needs of of\nSenior live all over our country is is transportation\nAnd for all kinds of reasons people live beyond their ability to drive national study so that\nPeople live something like seven to ten years beyond their ability to drive\nThey lose their license for macular degeneration or physical limitations or whatever so something like a dial a ride steps in and allows them to continue to have a life and independence and be able to\nUse the term agent place continue to live in their home or their apartment or or wherever a instill have that independence to their lives\nHaving mobility is so important because seniors can get isolated or without that it it can be terrifying this is such a vital thing are doing\nIt's it's uh it's amazing that the seniors\nOften do retreat into into their homes and isolate and ended up dying that way because they lose that social engagement\nOf being able to ah just get out and go to the grocery store to have the right kind of ... nutritional foods to go to their medical appointments and often times we find that\nWe may be able to take a senior to their primary care physician for that appointment but then they might get recommended to a specialist in another part of town\nThey don't have a way of getting there they don't want to go through the process so they just don't go for the appointment\nPeople can sign up for dial a ride pretty easy\nLee they just need to call you right always all the number that's correct it said nine

A. M. U. at NPR in Washington this is one egg [noise]\nHey there I'm not sure what Johnson today on one a retired General Stanley McChrystal on leadership his new book argues that history's leaders are too diverse to generalize some leaders run terrorist groups or create abusive workplaces yet they changed the world could we learn from them\nWe'll speak to General McChrystal in a moment and explore his new book leaders we begin with a nuclear treaty between the U.S and Russia one the President Trump says he will pull America out of\nSounds like a lot of people in pits Dr seuss and rent ties worked really hard on this and now the president seems ready to pull back what do we make of his comment when he said that Russia has not honored it's part of of the agreement is there any truth that\nPresident Trump is just a wrecking ball okay he has never seen the treaty that he doesn't want to destroy and um it would make sense to get out of a treaty like the treaty we're discussing\nOr if we had a weapon system coming along that we wanted to deploy\nThat is prohibited by the treaty okay\nYears ago George W. Bush got out of the A. B. M. treaty and I both missile treaty because we wanted to build FBI this she's like Defense Initiative\nTo protect our country from incoming ballistic missiles in that program was underway and ... in offers us good protection even today\nAgainst any North Korean missiles or Iranian missiles that are ... or Pakistani missiles or whatever but there was a reason to get out of the ab ... there's no reason that I can see to get out of the IMF tree and so President Trump sees the word treaty Joshua\nAnd he says holy cow let's just get out of it and that was true of the Paris accord that is true of anything he just likes or wrecking ball\nIt's like to destroy what he oversees\nWe're speaking to Ken eight I'm an author of Reagan Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director under President Reagan or former U.S ambassador to the un we welcome your questions and thoughts won a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nIt's interesting that at least two of you\nHave sent us comments with the same word in them that kind of makes me wonder can whether this is primarily political rather than strategic\nEdward commented on our Facebook page given the president's track record this makes perfect sense I N F was one of President Reagan's greatest achievements it needs to be re branded\nAnd vi who's here in Washington emailed Trump just wants his name on everything he pulled out of any deal to re brand it not repair it is this more about re branding meaning being able to have kind of a a a political climate in the bag or is there anything larger behind this\nI don't think there's anything larger behind it it's a re branding is what he did with the NAFTA agreement he changed uh three cameras in parentheses and the semi colon and then\nGave it another name and issues again I don't know what you would change the treaty we're talking about to make it any different or any better than it was you were actually right Josh where it takes a chunk of nuclear weapons out\nThat was the main threat to NATO in Nineteen eighty eighty one eighty to eighty three eighty four until the treaty was signed by President Reagan and I'm\nA Mikhail Gorbachev in the White House it's kinda funny Joshua a when Gorbachev came to town for the signing of the IMF treaty\nThere was a banquet given in his honor and I was asked to host the table\nAnd at my table was a businessman from New York Donald Trump\nWho had Barbara Walters was at our table to my wife said it was the only time a\nDuring the whole lunch I couldn't get a word in edgewise try do but a Trump was talking the whole time Barbara Walters are dying and Trump seemed to love it love the treaty and love everything about it uh so you know obviously he had no idea what it was all about and I I think probably today has no idea what it's all about\nAaron commented on our website the one eight dot org from what I have read the smartest move would have been for Trump to try to bring the Chinese into the treaty\nThat way the world will be safer and he can boast about his better deal which in that case would be true unfortunately John I hate all arms control treaties Bolton has his ear and this is the result worth noting that John Bolton national security visor he's in Moscow now meeting\nWith the Russian government and president Vladimir Putin's there today what about this idea of bringing in the Chinese they are increasingly bellicose interactions on the world stage what do you make of your income is\nI think Aaron is absolutely right I wrote a column about um\nBoy Thirty years ago in New York Times Joshua that said we should international lies the treaty in other words the United states and Russia than the Soviet Union but Soviet Russia were part of this treaty\nIt would be a wonderful idea to open it up to all countries around the world and I thought we could get a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty signatures had that happen I think the Chinese would have come in at that time but\nEveryone is absolutely right that today that would be a very good approach say there were prohibited from\nThis certain range of nuclear weapons the Russians are prohibited from the super this certain range and the Chinese should join us in that at least it puts pressure on them or to get\nInto the treaty and if they don't do it then it gives you some reason although not very good one for some reason to a venture we get out of the treaty it's a good reason to get out of the treaty if you have a program that you want to\nUm deploy a new uh some kind of device you wanted deployed to protect the country it'd venture interests those for HIV but it by the treaty but there are none that I can see\nI Know we have to pause and just a moment what what about the flip side of this I mean to the end of this treaty or at least if America pulls out does that mean that it opens the door for an arms race between the U.S and China and North Korea and Russia and whoever else I mean is that the is that the immediate results are is a little more complicated than\nThat is certainly allows Russia to enter into this space in a big way and to deploy missiles that were prohibited for all these years so yes it's a opening up a nuclear weapons or to more possibilities for Russia\nHow should we view that as a likelihood particularly since we have to pay so much attention to North Korea right now rightly so how likely do you think it is that Russia wants to rebuild that kind of arsenal it if the treaty went away\nI think very likely it's a it was a very good idea of errors in the seventies to target Rome in Paris and London and Berlin uh to drive a wedge between the NATO allies in Europe and the United states\nAnd if that's their objective which it obviously is with ... and I think this is a great device to do it and they could do it relatively cheaply by having missiles that threaten just those countries and\nIndividually threat you know so I think it's um you know it's a good move for Russia to bad move for America\nFewer quick questions I'd love to ask you on the other side of this pause if I may we're speaking to Ken eight I'm In Ronald Reagan's arms control director and former U.S ambassador to the UN still to come we'll speak to General Stanley McChrystal about his new book

X. dot com or from an agent Hitchcock's insurance encouraged courage\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're speaking to ten eight and former U.S ambassador to the un and the author of Reagan at Reykjavik let's get to a few more of your questions about this treaty before we move on to speaking with General Stanley McChrystal quite a few people ask questions\nLike what Catherine asked on our website the one eight dot org Catherine rights is this an actual treaty if it is wouldn't that be Congress\nTo turn against and try to destroy the United states of America which his mentor or his role model George Washington had helped established\nAnd he did it in defense of slavery and the contradiction there let me conclude he was not an evil person by definition I mean many of the good quality things that we would assigned to leaders he exhibited 'til the day he died in Eighteen Seventy\nBut the very contradiction and his departure from the values that I hold dear we're just too much for me to ignore\nThis feels like one of the kind of founding\nParadoxes within the book that you explored this question of what it means to be a great leader that's worth study may not necessarily emulate them but at least study is that their leaders who have done bad or anti social or abominable things but who can still teach us something about why we follow certain kinds of people\nWell that's right we have a crisis in leadership in the United states right now and I think we all know it\nWe may see it from different perspectives of political viewpoints but I think we all have this negative understanding that something is terribly wrong if we go back to the Nineteen sixties and some of the lies around the Vietnam War the resignation of president Nineteen Seventy four the financial crisis\nTo in fact Nineteen eighty seven and then the more recent financial crisis we find that\nMany of those in power we might call them the elites are leaders failed is pretty badly and so as a consequence a lot of our nation has grave doubts about what we've actually gotten for our leaders from our leaders\nBut yet we we constantly look for the next great leader the next person and will step forward and and solve our problems and take us to where we want to go [noise]\nWe tried to take this on I had studied leadership and tried to practice it for my entire career we tried to study this and what we did was we we said well why if we got that wrong and we went back all the way that the first century\nHistorian put talk and we looked at how leaderships been studied beginning with Pluto dark and his famous lives and then going through history\nAnd we said okay what is leadership really right we what we really came out is it's never it's not what we think it is and it never has been\nWe've looked at it through these methodologies as soon as a consequence because we look at leaders through bird lenses we drop bad conclusions right\nWe select the wrong people we elect to the wrong people we promote the wrong people and often we follow the wrong people all we expect unrealistic outcomes from those leaders\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a glad to get some of your comments about what makes for a good leader Lenny from Maryland emails\nRate leaders aren't necessarily involved with great big undertaking ... I'm In a play that opens this weekend and the director of the show is exceptional apart from his specific expertise in theater he has qualities that could mark any first rate leader including that he holds his team to high standards and he's honest with criticism but he's also generous with praise\nWe also heard from some of you who left notes for us Lena called us from Chile and let this in our inbox\nA good leader and somebody who can monkey on it in and group and they must be humble and open to learning new things\nLena and Lenny thank you both very much for sharing your thoughts with US West in Nashville emailed the greatest leadership quality is empathy it's the ability to put themselves in the shoes of those she or he is leading\nIt's interesting General McChrystal the in your book there's an array of examples of of leaders you know Robert he leaves even zealots like Maximilian holds Pierre who led the reign of terror during the French Revolution or a ... a colleague Coco Chanel Walt Disney Martin Luther and Martin Luther king\nAnd of the things that our listeners have said all of them apply\nAnd none of them apply there are examples where you have leaders that are empathetic with audiences like Walt Disney but who beat down their staff and people who worked for Disney after ... Snow White could say he was a very ... leader it just seems like there's there's no formula there's no equation\nWell that's absolutely right and one of them is that we came out is the idea that there are a list of traits or behaviors that a leader has which therefore makes him an effective leader is entirely incorrect we found leaders who have all of those traits and failed completely ... to be true\nWhat we really realized was leadership is not a thing of that a leader possesses it's not a magic power they point at followers and motivate inspire or direct\nIt's an interaction and what this means is the followers to have a larger agency a larger responsibility for the outcome than we sometimes admit and sometimes even leaders\nDon't admit that they they get put on a pedestal some of them like at some of them are reinforced that but in reality is that interaction between followers which gets to the points of empathy it gets to the point some willingness to understand what your followers need and to followers to understand what the leader needs to be effective\nI Know you have to pause in just a moment but I think this gets to the example that you\nCite in the book of Coco Chanel the inventor of the famous little black dress and the Chanel number five that what she was really selling was the image of herself\nAs this glamorous woman living in the post World War one age when when views of women and women's bodies were beginning to change like if she wasn't able to create that following\nAs a foundation for business she might never become the leadership became\nAnd it was extraordinarily thoughtful on her part because she made herself into a symbol essay lifestyle and then the products that she actually marketed we're all things that allowed a person to be as much like cocoa and her lifestyle as possible\nAnd it was very very powerful and it was important that cocoa understand there couldn't be too great a gap between\nThis alert that she presented and what people could attain so she had to be related will\nI bet you never thought she'd be studying Coco Chanel for leadership after attending West Point\nJosh what to tell you the truth I didn't know there was a Coco Chanel started this book I thought it was I thought it was just a brand name I was actually came from a perfect but she's a fascinating character and and when all is said and done she found an empire she's hard to work for but people flock\nTo follower and flock to work with her\nI'm Glad you know who Coco Chanel is now and we'll get to know some more of the people who you got to know a little bit better in the process of co offering the book leaders myth and reality we are speaking to retired General Stanley McChrystal\nAuthor of the book we walk a more of your questions and thoughts as well one at a at W.

regards to the war on terror Matt who is an army major has served four deployments to Afghanistan\nMet ask what conditions need to be met for the U.S and NATO to pull out of Afghanistan without the Afghan government\nFalling apart should the u._s. negotiate with the Taliban is it possible to see them become a legitimate political party in Afghan politics general if ever there was a leadership question that plays out on the world stage and they're very real way it's the war in Afghanistan but which said I'm at\nWell I Would say that look two or three moves down or ten or Twenty years down the vision of potential future for Afghanistan but would it might look like and and they're certainly limits on both sides to that how bad can it be and how good kid can be and then move toward that\nThe idea that we will go get a decisive military victory has\nBeen proven unrealistic at the same time the idea that all the Afghans are corrupt and not worthy of our support is not in line with my experience\nSo I think that like we need to think politically we need to think about compromise is when you think about leadership we need to think about giving people hope twenty six million Afghans the vast majority just want the hope that tomorrow and next year will be better than last year because the last Thirty years had been very difficult\nTo the degree which we can help provide conditions for that\nThat's the way we need to go\n... emailed my colonel in junior ROTC was a very solid leader instructed participated gave and received criticism and cared about the growth of

our politicians conduct and their me first attitude is there\nAbout a systemic problem with our present day policy general\nI think there's a a challenge with that because we say we want humble leaders but\nEgo tests are over represented in CEOs and politicians and our system our media all parts of it seemed to support that think about Harriet Tubman we profiled Harriet Tubman in the book and she's a five foot tall African American middle aged female former slave\nWho goes back into slave territory sir teen times riskier recapture and\nRe enslavement to bring out other slaves not because she's paid for it but because she thinks she should she doesn't want anything for it but what she does she becomes a symbol\nShe becomes a symbol on African Americans who won't give up she becomes a symbol not just for abolition is but for heroism in America and for female heroism and America she didn't\nHave a big ego she wasn't trying to ah be on the pedestal and yet in many ways she defines what I think of is that kind of humble leader that is actually backed up by a willingness to do what needs to be done\nBriefly before we have to let you go I Know it's hard to generalize on what leaders do right is there one thing you found many of the leaders that you profiled in your\nBook tended to do wrong or tended to regret before we let you go I Would say the biggest regret is is typically being narrow is thinking about them thinking about their outcome it's really about the followers and it's about that the situation in reality and they they don't fit themselves to that\nWhen you say it's about the followers\nIn terms of putting more focus on the people who trust them\nWell you are meeting needs of followers a leader can lead themselves all day and there'll be leader a leader of a band one the reality is you've got to be attuned to your followers some of the most effective negative politicians can pull it the heartstrings and emotions are followers and they can\nBring out a lot of vitriol and other things but good leaders can do the pause the positive side of that\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal co author of the new book leaders miss and reality General

the same construction industry on Long Island for and they had known each other for fifty years is going to go do that to me but that's fine that I own that that's part of my naivete as I describe in the book um I didn't sense or not you know it was too trusting Harry Truman says if you\nWant a friend in Washington you got to own a dog so I was too trusting and so he he went and created this whole salacious storage swine I and again I own the story\nBut what what what what what I Hope I'm explaining and the story\nYou had forces inside the system that really didn't want Mr Trump to be president rice ...\nUh he can re characterize himself now but I remember the scenes at the CNBC debate we're having Sean Spicer we're trying to get them to either shut off Mr Trump's a microphone or get the questions in the air time shifted to the establishment\nA group of people and I mean during the Republican primary debates yeah no question I also remember a Mr previous also telling Mr Trump\nWhen he was then a candidate after the Access Hollywood tape to drop out of the race and he specifically said that he was going to lose by Fifteen Percent and and so on and so forth and um\nYou know listen I mean the fact that Mr Trump then made him the cheapest staff now you had the great set up and so the Trump loyalists we're in a civil war slash conflict with the orange the people that Mr previous was bringing into the administration and then when he was doing was flooding the place with our and see people\nAnd they were directed by Mr ... to do all the leaking and all that are necessary nonsense people don't remember 'cause it's Fifteen sixteen months ago now but the first six months of the the why does all leaks week one one after the other and I explained to the president what they were doing I showed them\nWhere the cut outs where a journalist like putting their names at the bottom of each other stories and I was circling the names okay this is how they're leaking on you and this is where they go when they want to use your name and this is where they go when they want to attack\nOr other people inside the administration and you're right it was that was kind of one of your primary jobs as you as the president that it was close to us to find out who was who is doing is legal but I Do wonder though in terms of nonsense actually but I also handle it the way an entrepreneur would handle it and they handle it the way a business executive would have handled it\nAnd that was a big mistake by me I should have handled it like a Washington operative and I didn't unfortunately have any Washington operative experience and so that's why the flame that was pretty abrupt\nWe're speaking to Anthony Scaramucci his new book is called trumped the blue collar president we welcome some of your questions and thoughts as well Michael wrote us on our Facebook page I'm not a fan of the luge or Trump but he has a strong point\nTrump strategy has been working very well for him this entire time since announcing his candidacy he pulled his GOP opponents defeated the most qualified candidate in American history and his base is super energized Democrats need to switch up their strategy if they want to stop losing all the time\nI I Wonder how you reflect kind of broadly on your time in Washington you said that you know there are certain aspects\nOf the of the Washington establishment that you dealt with more like a businessman than\nLike a Washingtonian how much of what you encountered working with the Trump Administration do you think was inherent to Washington as opposed to connect to to working for Donald Trump in Washington I mean did change a lot of the game in terms of the way Washington works\nListen it's totally inherent to watching it I mean these are these are terrible people I mean you\nKnow but he picked up living around him so he chose to hire writes pretty well ban an end you while there was that was that was Mr Trump's biggest mistake and I do write about that in the book you know if you're building a condominium you're going to hire a condominium builders if you're building a golf course you're going to have a golf course builders\nAre the president made a mistake the president elect by hiring Washingtonians you're not going to drain the swamp if you put a cesspool operator in charge of the White House I mean you know what's gonna end up happening is extra sewage is going to dump into the swamp and so you can't drain the swamp by hiring assess cooperate or\nTheir job is to protect themselves because they look at the president's ... hill lasts for possibly eight years I'm part of the artifice of this system I'm part of this whole business model and so you know we're just gonna wait this guy out and so I mean that's what they do but\nYour your your listeners comment I think is apropos he doesn't have to be my fan of fact I respect the fact that he is it my fan\nBut I Do appreciate it at least he's listening to me by telling him hey wait a minute guys got a game plan he has an offensive strategy and he's beating you on the playing field so you may want to get in the locker room and change your strategy or you're going to get beat again and so that's the message and in my book and by the way\nYou know the wages are up or the economy's doing better the slack has been cut from the African American and Hispanic American labor markets primarily because of the reduction of illegal immigration at the border or he's trying to get a peace deal down in North Korea is a lot of good things going on\nBut I think when people are really upset her sword the president that it's more personality related is the sharp points in style it some of the exaggerations that he's making at some of these rallies it's some of the tweets where the ad hominem tweets that are going off\nAt people and a lot of those who frankly I don't personally like you know you could still like the president be a supporter of his but not like certain elements of his personality and so that's another big problem with the society right now everyone's got a litmus test\nIf you say one negative thing about the president then you get demonize if you say you use like certain elements of the Democratic playbook which I Do you know I'm for gay marriage I'm for\nA woman's right to choose I'm very socially liberal that way well then you get in trouble with a certain group of people in the Republican Party I Do want to I Do want to toss you've got to end that nonsense\nBasically I Do want to talk more about messaging when we continue with Anthony

and his new book Trump the blue collar president we welcome your questions for Mr Scaramucci acknowledge that there are quite a few of the audience who are questioning our shall we say editorial choice to bring Mr Scaramucci on NPR duly noted you can spend the time to complain about the gifts that we pick which is you're right\nWhat's the point that super important to you and let them get rid of the role\nIn that too because he doesn't seem to have any desire to to be that guy he ... and this huge list that like he he he's digging it I'm surprised\nWhen they go to the last page in my book and you'll see what I wrote he has an adaptive enough personality he started as a Democrat he gravitated to the Republican Party he has an adaptive enough deal making sort of a personality\nHe could be the guy that does that um and so uh but he's not right now why but I Wish I Wish you well because I think what ends up happening to him and he's a he's a fighter and so people are ... people punch him\nHe's a ten punch back sort of a guy and so now he's locked into that struggle okay you're hitting me greater going to punch back ten times\nAs opposed to cutting a deal I mean he sent out a tweet

the middle I I kinda wonder I Know I Know we've got to move on we electrical momentarily but I Wonder as you reflect back on your time\nIn the White House whether there are things that you wish you had done differently any mistakes you wish you could undo I mean I I'm I'm sure you're generally proud of the time you spent their but is there any one thing in particular that stands out that you like if you if you could do it again\nYou don't have enough time on your show for the next year for me to recount all the mistakes that I made inside the White House so I may probably twenty five

of your self consciousness and fear of failure or to get to where you want to go in a life and so that's my big resonating message but yeah\nI got tremendous progress I made a lot of mistakes and you
