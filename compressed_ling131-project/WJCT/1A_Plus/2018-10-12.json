A. M. U. and NPR this is one a\nA there I'm Joshua Johnson visiting shaky leading public radio in San Francisco today on one a it's the friday news roundup Michael is long gone after devastating Florida's panhandle this after a new un report feeding the climate changes making these major storms more likely\nBrett Kavanaugh joins the Supreme Court and Nikki Haley will step down as UN ambassador also Kanye West raises eyebrows at the White House and the two main candidates vying to become California's next governor has had a chicken we'd we'd love\nShane Harris what do we heard from the president's so far on hurricane Michael the devastation and also the recovery effort what's even say well\nLargely praised it and of course and he spent a lot of time in Florida had good things to say about the resiliency and the professionalism of emergency management and first responders\nOr in Florida a he knows well of course a as hobbies are saying what the outrage was the response with Hurricane Maria and previous previous her hurricane previous this of course\nA President Trump inspired a so much outrage and push back when he question whether the death toll now stands at more than three thousand people in Puerto Rico was accurate and accused Democrats of making up the number so he will have good things to say as long as the response goes well and really for any president\nA FEMA and the whole disaster response works well when you can de politicize it as much as possible\nAnd really left the professionals take over with the response that appears to be what's happening now here as well it's also going to be though the aftermath you heard rock long talking about rebuilding the power grid\nIf they are even rebel will have to be completely rebuilt now that the brunt of the storm is over it was very quick and very powerful few dead but the clean up here is massive if that is slow if people aren't getting the money the release that they need if there are problems with claim adjustments as there were during Hurricane Sandy that's where it all comes back to root for research for the White House\nNow adds to just the raw devastation of hurricane Michael the conversation than many people have been having this week about the nature of climate change this week the un released a major report on climate change which came with very dire warnings for the planet\nPresident Trump had a fairly skeptical reaction to the report's findings listen\nMan I Wish I could afford that are that are but I Will be looking at it as\nPart of what the president said after this report came out worth noting that the report\nWas compiled by a consortium of scientists from around the world one of whom we spoke to on this program this week you'll find that program on line at the one a dot org\n... I Wonder what your senses of how you know the administration's response to this report might affect the way we deal with storms like this are in the in the future\n[noise] yeah well you know as he mentioned this is a credible source is it the eyepiece the sea and they've been putting these reports out for years now and what strikes me about this one in particular that people are actually talking about it it seems to have penetrated\nAt that complacency barrier that we often run into when we talk about climate\nChange and I'm Sorry I should say the eyepiece she sees the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change this international group it's kind of under the age of the un\nRight exactly and the main message here is not one of pure despair although it does outline you know some very scary scenario is if you see global temperatures rise even incrementally from the same one and a half degrees Celsius hit two degrees Celsius\nBut there is this sense here that you can still do something that we can still do something about this and you know California ... California and south in ... where the ... that that the home of the resistance against that Donald Trump\nAnd certainly on this issue that's been the case that tear chair question governor Jerry Brown has made the fight against climate change a signature issue\nHe'll joke about how he's going to be long gone by the time some of these worst case scenarios come to pass but he's really trying to make and California it'd be seen as a leader at a time when the fed are pushing back\nAgainst the science and and you heard Donald Trump set the tone that he's taken on that in that soundbite you just played\nIn terms of being able to deal with a challenge to speak it's also worth noting that the Nobel Prize in economics went out at the start of this week to poll Romer and William Nord house the two of them had been studying the economics of climate change Nord house has endorsed a universal carbon tax\nRumors research shows that humans are innovative enough to solve a challenge even as big as climate change to perhaps that's the reason\nFor some hope we're here at ... speaking to ... corresponded with the California report political journalist Todd's willing and Shane Harris of the Washington Post we welcome your questions and thoughts about this or any of the big stories across the country that made news this week one a at W.

U. dot org before we move on from the weather and climate lily there was one more thing you want us to to\nWill be knocked down the biggest name for you right away Joshua Johnson Ivanka Trump a first daughter was\nPretty quick to tweet out how on earth she wants to be considered but that that person will not be me so we will not happen bathroom evocative have at least not by her own reckoning the biggest name that was being bandied about by the press as soon as Nikki Haley stepped down was Dina Powell a former deputy national security advisor\nA Dina Powell says yesterday she is staying at Goldman Sachs where she is ensconced as an executive now and making plenty of money\nUm people have thrown out Bob Corker his name he's currently chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee not a Donald Trump ally and as of January first not a senator anymore he's retiring is going to be looking for a job probably hoping to make more money than he would make if he were UN ambassador again those two gentlemen\nDon't get along but also President Trump does have a a demonstrated history of getting over it if you want somebody to serve him but there been a couple of other names that had been put out as a ... sort of put around the beltway as well Richard gr now is\nA former spokes spokesmen at the un a current ambassador to Germany\nI Believe in the highest ranking I think openly gay Republican in the administration that's one little part of his bio and also Brian Hook who worked for Rex Tillerson Rex Tillerson ousted of course the secretary of state and Brian is one of the people who managed to\nHang on a state and really keep his I'm sort of keep his bona fides with the Trump Administration his name has been out there as well\n[noise] I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one eh\nLet's move on to an op ed that was published this week in USA Today written by the president himself the headline quotes\nDemocrats Medicare for all plan would demolish promises to seniors unquote stop it began by laying out the president's opposition to the Medicare proposal from Senator Bernie Sanders then it transition to a broader criticism of Democrats he wrote in part quote\nThe truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead the new Democrats are radical socialist who wants a model America's economy after Venezuela unquote\nNow other journalists quickly criticize USA Today and pounced on the paper for publishing the op ed pointing out that nearly every single sentence contains something false USA Today did have an online version of the op ed that had some fact checks in it but that does you know good if you read a newspaper on paper\nShane Harris I Wonder what you see in terms of the strategy of White House publishing this op ed it's the first of its kind how important really is it that it was tearing down this Medicare for all proposal and and how important is it the u._s._a. today just kind of let it run as it\nYou know there's there's two two thoughts on this one is there's the political and slipped through this which is a place to get in USA Today which has a huge circulation and has a lot I think probably more market penetration and places where President Trump would like to get this message across than perhaps than New York times over my paper the Washington Post\nUm so what you're seeing here was almost the tax version of a Trump rally where he will make all kinds of assertions\nA false hoods uh maybe lives regrets calls him of them lives we can dissect them and categorize them uh but but this was really I mean I think my colleagues opposed Glenn Kessler who is the sort of the fact checking gold standard used that line and you mentioned that nearly every sentence contain something misleading or a fall so in that sense I think you can view this much more\nAs a political document that kind of rallying document then there comes the second question which is All right if that's the case what was the journalistic obligation of USA Today\nTo push back on this and I must say I haven't met on the editorial side I'm On the news side there's a bit of a church and state separation but if I were a media reporter I Would not\nBe that impressed by USA Today's responds to say well we give people a lot of leeway in their opinions um there is the old saying you're entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts US Senator Moynihan said ah it seemed like the leeway that USA Today was giving the president in this op ed\nJust random crashing right into the hall of what the basic fact checking is supposed to be about um so I'm Still not quite understanding how the editors chose to go ahead and allow this to run in the form that it did and it's frankly it's a real embarrassment for USA Today\nAnd it is worth noting though many papers you know on even on the editorial team ... or ... it was like there is an editor who edits editorials to make sure that they're accurate there at the ground and the fact\nAbsolutely you know I think Trump recognizes that this is going to be a rallying cry for the Democrats not just in the mid term that looking at it had to twenty twenty\nAnd this is something that here in California US Senator Harris and is out front on talking about it um and she's actually the first person to back Senator Sanders on this last year at least publicly newsstand I gather news in the running for governor or\nOn the Democratic ticket and media Italy took to Twitter to strike down ... comments in this op ed and he talked about Trump support for the grand ... allowed insurance to charge more\nFor preexisting conditions is is absolutely something they gather news is running I he wants to government run health care system\nAnd Trump actually called him out in Montana a couple of weeks ago on this thing not only does news wind sat universal healthcare he also wants it to apply to undocumented immigrants had kept trying jokes he may even move here to California to get their free health care\nOr story we'd like to start getting into before we have to pause and there has to do with the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed Saturday in fifty to forty eight Senate vote sworn in as a justice over the weekend and on Monday in a ceremonial swearing in with the justice is family by his son listen\nTo\n\nPart of the swearing in ceremony for the newest Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nIs confirmation to the Supreme Court comes after a month long battle between Democrats and Republicans over that nomination we'd like to talk more about how that confirmation\nHas resonated across the country and frankly whether this fight is over some senators are vowing to continue that fight against Kavanaugh so what would be their next move will get into that and we continue our conversation with political journalist Todd's will like\nShane Harris intelligence and national security reporter for the Washington Post and Malaysia Molly co host and correspondent of the California report here it\nEating Brian in Portland New Hampshire writes does it strike anyone else's unseemly the Trump in the midst of the Florida disaster

A. M. U. dot org cuts will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nI'm ... and and doing so at a time when ... has taken in billions of dollars and direct\nA direct money from the Saudis\nDon't show he he's running in ... addict born into Iran I Believe\nI don't know if he was born in ... he is Iranian American\nTop can you say quick word about the kind of position this puts us in the U.S does have a fair amount of dealings with Saudi Arabia right now including military dealing\nA lot of dealings and when you saw the president's response yesterday in the oval office to reporters' questions about this the president said I don't like it I don't like at one bit it appears ... went in the embassy and it never came out and then painted right away to point out the show he was not an American citizen\nWhich seems to have a subtext of maybe not my problem and then pointed out the hundred and ten billion dollars that Saudi Arabia is spending on American weapons deals went as far as to say do you want that money going to great American companies like Raytheon and McDonnell Douglas\nA and Boeing or do you want them going to China this was the president's thinking over how the United states should react\nTo the probable murder of an American resident and a journalist and I and I will point out as well this conference that we mentioned are the Saudis sponsored economic\nDevelopment conference media ... media co sponsors American media companies including CNN CNBC others have all pulled out of this conference a Steve mission the secretary of the treasury as of right now\nIs still going the Trump Administration is still in there still all in for NBS for Mohammad bin ... and they are not pulling out to basically showing their support in the president's statement while saying he's concerned about it has a presidential concern made it very very clear I'm afraid to say that\nHe really doesn't I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nCan't come to California without talking a little bit about California politics in ... let me kept up with you for a bit you spent some time in California's Central valley that quarter the runs on either side of interstate five talking to people about the upcoming elections she was a clip from bill pine vice Celia California listen\nWell it's been at least the wrong times since\nI've seen a negative campaign on both sides and whether Republican or democratic and I just read more about saying what their ambition is what they\nPlan to do as far as trying to discredit the\nThat's the bill pine and vice Celia California closer to highway Ninety nine further east inland from interstate five what else did you hear from voters in the area by ... is a a GOP strong\nIt is and this is actually a district and they held currently by a guy you might have heard that the newness\nAnd Bill Payne is a long time supporter of ... as he was actually on his way to a new ad campaign event with appearing with Jason Jason ... former congressman from Utah now Fox News personality to try and race in campaign signs\nOn and it was struck by when bill said today because he said at one point I've gotten to the point where I don't believe anyone anymore and that was really reflected what I saw across that distract 'em you know there's deep distrust frankly and the national media\nAnd it was it was challenging to kinda do that icebreaker to to talk to people because they were like where are you finding they've been approached by you know multiple national we ever by and um you know it was a case where you got to go there and you know I show up at his high school and ended up talking to his ad teacher for\nAbout twenty minutes and he told me that multiple outlets have tried to contact him and he always says no\nFor the most part um so you see a real wariness and this is a district that has a lot of serious issues we're talking about high levels of poverty high levels of\nUh illiteracy and water contamination I think there is a sense that deadline unit has gotten a somewhat distracted by all this Russia stuff or that Russia conspiracy as one person put it\nOn and you know is that taking some of his focus ... uh and attention away from local issues quite possibly\nTricky we had a big coup this week hosting California's one and only debate between the two major party candidates democratic lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom and Republican level John Cox just briefly literally any major takeaways I mean I have a new service kind of an angling for this job for a long long long\nTime as you know well from having spent some time here yourself the key issue here I think is really going to be housing or they spend a lot of time talking about that in this debate everyone agrees that the situation is bad you know people are leaving California and where are they going their plate going to places like Texas and Arizona\nA Oregon places where the cost of living is lower on the housing affordability issue has had a lot of people here are very hard\nCox John Cox of Republican uh in this race is trying to play up his role as a as a home builder for many years you the business San Fran San Diego he says you know in his own experience he's seen how expensive it it is to build new housing here\nAt the approval times can go on for years he compares you know building a a unit in Indiana you need six months versus here I can take up to Fifteen Years is a little vague admittedly on how he plans to address that\nKnew him for his part and is talking about how the state doesn't have specific objectives in time lines in place until the criticism Cox\nLevel that him ways well he's been in office for sixteen years via where have you been on this all this time versus mayor of San Francisco and then as lieutenant governor\nYou know Trump looms large in this race but he's not um you know you

for the first time and the un warns the climate change will become critical sooner than expected\nWe'd love to hear from you email one a double you AMD dot org or to feed us out to one [noise]\nA figure of a reassurance I think when she and she was a good communicator I mean you know you and she took on the Russian ambassador and she had the picture of the children who had been guy Scott spin a chemical weapons attack in Syria I you know I think the rest of the international community community thought she was highly effective\nIn what she was doing and I suspect\nThey will miss her a ... worries that maybe you're going to end up with somebody\nWho is even less international is less kind of global listed in the kind of you and sense of it and therefore may be more difficult person to deal with\nWill re freedom and that's kind of what I wanted to ask you about particularly the tone of Nikki Haley compared to some of America's other leaders on the world stage I mean you have Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state who's more hawkish than his predecessor Rex Tillerson you have John Bolton the national security advisor who is definitely not shy about his view of the ...\nAnd what America's foreign policy should be what sort of thought so far any way about who or what might be next in terms of America's presence on the UN would it be someone who is a little more in line with John Bolton and Mike Pompeo in terms of being more more hawkish and more\nUh more more forward or someone in line more like Nikki Haley yeah\nI Would bet on someone who is more in line with Donald Trump's America First vision and we don't know that there have been a number of names floated one name with Dina Powell formerly served on his national security council now that's being batted down and there was some criticism that she was too much of you know in Trump's derogatory to a derogatory term a global is\nI'm Wondering though striking about Nikki Haley as John mentioned some time she was trumpeting without being Trump sometimes she wasn't even Trump Ian right you would actually be a check on the president and things like Russia being more aggressive\nOn Russia I'm Talking about human rights which almost no one else in the administration did and\nOne thing that I've noticed is that over time as Donald Trump has settled in to the presidency he started to surround himself with people who will more at even if they don't believe exactly even if they aren't true believers in his America First vision or at least can help enable his agenda as opposed to serving as a chat or obstructing his agenda that is what we've seen\nWith like ... versus Rex Tillerson\nAs always seem to John Bolton versus HR McMaster so I Would assume that who may follow Nikki Haley will be someone who is more of a true believer or at least more willing to enable the agenda rather than stand up to the president and that will have implications for U.S policy at the United nations\nAnd already since that term gets thrown around so much that's not always meant as a compliment when we say someone is a global list what are we talking about what the term like what's the code underlying that\nYeah the idea you know uh the way\nTrump supporters used in a derogatory fashion is that they people are concerned about global interests and forgetting about the primacy of the national interest there you know what Donald Trump often said he wants to stop looking out for the world and started looking out for America and then the feeling is that if you're a global if you don't have America's national sovereignty national interest in mind\nBut you know defenders of that with the America is the leader of the world we are trying to we're\nTrying to help create in the international system in which you know human rights or champion and their stability and our we prevent conflict and all these things and we have to think that in our current twenty first century world things like climate change or not just\nYou know an issue for the United states industry issue for the world they're transnational issues that everyone needs to care about and we have to have more international us mindset\nAnd a mindset of working with other countries in order to solve problems that don't just affect us but affect all lots of other countries so that the the pro global if a mindset but it has really become I wear a term that has been more targets in the Trump Administration as people have argued that we spend too much time being international minded and not enough time being national minded\nWe're speaking to re Friedman who covers global affairs for the Atlantic John ...
