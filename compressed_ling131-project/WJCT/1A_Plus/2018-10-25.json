J. C. T. [noise]\n\n[noise] we're continuing our discussion now about national team driver safety week with Matthew pause gay at cooker law and Trish Johnson creator of\nThe apex virtual vehicle uh now this virtual simulator which she recently uh\nFor the kids at Wilson High school is a way to fill the gap or over the way vehicles roads in traffic have changed over the last half century but drivers ed courses have now what what are some of the differences and what did the kids learn\nSure saying well we've provided this virtual vehicle to also high school for their freshman to use their freshmen will have an opportunity for the reluctance class to be there and get free training sessions during the year\nIt gives them an opportunity to be in a less stressful environment\nAnd to gain practical experience and driving which is the safest way for them to learn they don't have parents who stressful enough next to them ... and a lot of it is they can do it on their own and then they can look back and see the skills that they are strong out and the skills they need more help with\nWithout being criticized or or treated in a bad way so it's really an opportunity for them to learn in a controlled environment less stressful and and get the experience they need\nNow Trish when you and I were sixteen getting the driver's license was very\nVery important and the minute we got it we were out and rolling and that's not true anymore no why is why is that\nWell you're absolutely right Twenty years ago about Fifteen Percent of high school seniors did not have a license and now that number is thirty percent\nYeah so we had to stop all they're not as eager to dry they aren't there there I think there are many factors the cost of driving a car is certainly part of that for some families are teenagers today what technology can connect with their friends without ever leaving their bedroom that's the other big part of it isn't it yeah but I've been able to work with a lot of local families\nAnd it's kinda like peeling onion and when you get to the very bottom of it it usually comes out that they were just terrified\nThey knew that they were not ready to be out on Atlantic boulevard and the only way they were going to be able to drive was to\nKind of suck it up and get out there in and try to make that work and and they just they're completely overwhelmed and\nCities have gotten more crowded and more dangerous they have roads have gotten more dangerous\nThey have and again these this generation is not coming into the driving process with a lot of the against skill set that that my generation have so their skill set is low but they're awareness is extremely high and they know they're unprepared they know the roads are dangerous\nUm so they just kind of opt out and many times will come up with a lot of excuses why\nThey don't want to drive when the reality is they're just terrified when they come in and work with me at the virtual vehicle or certainly for the Wilson students now it gives them that safe learning environment\nNow the virtual vehicle is open to any parents out there that wants to train their teen uh how can people get a session how can they train their budding team driver on this simulator\nYes I I I Do have an office locally so they can go to a packs resource center dot com and get more information about the sessions that that we conduct\nApex resource center dot com or two\nWho do this I'm going to be doing this uh we've got a Fifteen year old who really needs is and help her law as well or is part of this campaign safer streets through smarter drivers anything else plan with is\nAbsolutely it's something that is just the beginning of what we like to do to make the streets safer in our community\nUm the program that we've done was with Trish at Wilson High school was great the leading causes of teen crashes of those eight leading causes for them or dealt with directly with this virtual vehicle but we're looking at other alternatives\nOther things we can do in the community whether it's expanding it was other schools but also other initiatives we can do to make the streets safer for Jacksonville\nI'm sure other schools would love to have this come to their campus it's something we're looking into yeah and I'm sure the juniors and seniors would like it to\nMy daughter's a sophomore she already has her learners permit yeah me too but she herself has gotten so much more experience and confidence behind the wheel by using the virtual vehicle\nAnd so it it really does it it's a virtual reality immersion you really feel like you're on the road\nAbsolutely yeah and the scenarios that you're going to deal with are going to be exactly what you're going to deal with\nOn the first coast but we can duplicate it we can have ... and a great example it it's really terrifying how many of my students have come up to an intersection and turn left in front of an oncoming car\nAnd individual vehicle I can let them make that mistake and it ends up being a crash and they had this deer in the headlights look they have no idea what on what happened\nIf you're out on the road practicing with them you have to ... stop somehow\nAnd that's where the disconnect happened they know that their parent is yelling to stop but the reason why they don't understand so what happens when you're out on the roads code driving\nYou have to do as a parent you have to do a lot of the heavy lifting you can allow them to do what they will naturally do and that's why when young people get a license the first few months so many of them have crashes\nRight and it's why so many parents have gray hair [laughter] this is a really\nGreat way to address this it is a national team driver safety week go to a packs resource center dot com to access the apex virtual vehicle teacher teen to drive\nAnd coke or law dot com for more about this safer streets through smarter drivers program right here in Jacksonville

T Jacksonville\nDonald Trump built an image as a self made billionaire an image that helps him win the presidency [noise] how does that image match up with the facts and what impact might that have\nFrom W. A. M. U. and NPR this is one\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson visiting Georgia Public broadcasting in Atlanta today on one eighth Trump's taxes the president has refused to release his income tax returns\nNow an extensive New York times investigation of his family's taxes suggests that he and his father manufactured that's self made image and doing so may have started tax laws were broken down we're also watching the investigation\nInto suspicious packages sent a prominent figures across the country lots to get too including your questions about the times investigation so comment on our Facebook page or tweet us ... one\nHelped us lay out sort of a roadmap for the different streams of wealth overflowing to them\nAnd then we began to try to find people who had been\nIn and around Fred Trump's empire over the decades and develop sort of a network of sources that\nCould provide us more insider documents um and we of course when you receive those kinds of things you have to be careful that you know the person that has them um had a reason to have them legally enough ethically and we've never had any\nDoubt about that um and then from that sort of pile of documents a couple of hundred tax returns from\nHis various business entities general ledgers financial statements we were able to call it all that into a pretty cohesive picture of the scope and a magnitude of this vast and highly profitable empire\nAll right let's start to get into some of the details of that picture starting with the loans that Donald Trump says he got from his father Fred Trump the president the now president\nMaintains it was just a one million dollar loan that he had to pay back with interest and basically that that one million dollars the implication is that million dollars was the genesis for a fortune that Donald Trump built himself Suzanne is that true\nIt's possible in there he did get a million dollar loan and probably paid it back with interest but we found\nMore than sixty million dollars just in loans um that for the Trump over the years gave it to his son many of these loans weren't repaid many of them had low interest I'm so imbedded in there there is a million dollar loan but there's a lot of million dollar loans in there\nSo it's not true that the only loan he got what's that one million dollars\nNow it's a it's in its ally\n... by the way when we're talking about\nThe money that's involved in this report in and Russ correct me if I'm wrong we have to be careful and I'll Try to be careful with it myself this hour in terms of the way we discuss the money there are places in the report where you talk about the real value of what was spent or bought or sold\nAnd then the value in today's dollars is that right so the million dollars we're talking about we're talking about a million dollars then at the time not to be equivalent in twenty Eighteen dollars of a million bucks is that right\nWell I think what you're talking about there that's how Donald Trump describes it as he received a million dollars at some point in time and he's never really narrowed down your right and we did when we were talking about the money he receive we tried to talk about that\nCohesive alert coherently like in current dollars so it wouldn't be\nConfusing um for instance he's receiving twenty thousand dollars a year from the time he's three years old today that doesn't sound like a lot but in Nineteen forty nine when that started it was the equivalent of physicians salary today that's the equivalent of two hundred thousand dollars a year so when we address those things we tried to talk about them and and current dollars just to make it clear and easy to understand\nBut with the loans that's actual like loans that were valued at that time at a million dollars it would be more than a hundred million dollars today if we look at the loans sixty million that we found a sixty one million is actual uh the time money\nGotcha gotcha we're seeing the two investigative reporters from the New York times Suzanne Craig and rush Buechner who helped report this exhaustive study of the finances\nOf the Trump family in New York we welcome your questions and thoughts as well one a at W. A. M. U. dot org before I read some of your response as we should note that both the president and his staff of pushback\nOn this report a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about it at the White House press briefing earlier this month here's what she said\nThe president's lawyer address some of the specific claims and ... how the allegations of fraud and tax evasion or ... percent false and highly defamatory there was no fraud or tax evasion\nBy anyone he went on a much further and I would just encourage you to read every word of his statement a which completely undercuts the accusations made by the New York times\nThat was press secretary Sarah Sanders speaking earlier this month we have that statement on our website the one a dot org also in response to this investigative report the president tweeted the following quote\nThe failing New York times did something I have never seen done before they used the concept of time the value of money time value of money in doing a very old boring and often told ... piece on me\nAdded up this means that Ninety seven percent of their stories on me are bad\nNever recovered from bad election call unquote\nLet's break this into two parts will get to the time value of money thing in a second but first of all uh ... what do you make of the White House's responses to your report\nUm ... you're not a lot I suppose that they make the sort of sweeping accusation that there are factual issues or that the factual underpinnings of this is incorrect\nAh we laid out all the facts and all the explanation the source documents to all this very clearly there wasn't a single instance where they raised a specific problem it sounds like they just don't like it or want it to dismiss it\nAnd Suzanne this term but they use time value of money I've never heard that term before what does that time value of money\nIs going to say I'm not I'm not rush to take that 'cause I I'm not even are okay or the ... I think what they're talking about there is is is inflation\nAdjusted dollars um and to say he's never seen it done before I think he would have had been living in a cave to never seen that done before it's in fact done\nEvery day for the reasons I described a couple of moments ago um that ... a dollar in Nineteen fifty is not the same as a dollar today and so you typically adjusts those things are to to make it clear and and meaningful and the federal outside as well yeah\nI Know we have to pause and the moment but let me get to one comment charisma kings treated with respect to taxes tax avoidance is not a crime tax evasion is folks who are involved in criminal ventures evade taxes high earners like Trump avoid them and do so with the help of high priced accountants blame the system not Trump\nSuzanne what do you make of that tweet before we pause\nIt's it's the story looks at it both the tax avoidance that went on throughout the years with the inherited wealth that Donald Trump got but it also shows very clearly\nThat there was a lot more than talks avoidance going on Donald Trump stepped over the line into the legality um and and we outline a number of schemes and the story I'm using you know documents both\nThat we we got from various sources including I'm Fred Trump and his empire to show that the that much of went what went on and how he inherited fortune was done through through legal means\nWe'll get into some of those schemes as we continue our conversation with Suzanne ... and ... of the New York times\nVarying reactions from some of you to this Chris wrote on our Facebook page wow what news a rich man trying to keep his money shocking we'll get some more of your questions and comments and just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson glad to be with you from Atlanta you're listening to one a firm W.

Johnson before we get back to our discussion on the New York times investigation we want it to update you on the investigation of suspicious packages that have turned up around the country in the past few days\nA series of pipe bombs were mailed or delivered by careers to top democratic figures from LA to New York to Washington the bombs were wrapped in bubble wrap and manila envelopes they're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary\nAnd they submit them to various government entities to justify rent increases on tenants who are living in their rent regulated buildings it was an insidious down side of this scheme so they not only were draining the money to override paying tax they hit their tenets whether that's illegal\nSo Suzanne I Want to I Want to just try to re articulate just to make sure I've got a street in my head so you've got these buildings these these rental buildings that the Trump family owns frayed restaurant buys things of that for a trombone spreads from buys things where the buildings like boilers in air conditioners or whatever [noise]\nAnd does go into the buildings but all town see this this company from the Trump children\nCreates invoices would say well this thing that you bought the costs three hundred dollars actually costs five hundred dollars and there's there's two hundred dollar gaps so that allowed for a way of claiming at these items cost more\nThan Fred Trump spent and the difference in that is where things begin to get funky with for tax purposes that it\nThat said and they they would profit the difference everything you know sometimes the markup would be\nFive five thousand dollars if it was a boiler we saw mark ups anywhere from twenty to fifty percent so over and over and over again um items were bought for Fred Trump's building all county would pay the vendors they would create a padded receipt over and over and over send it up to Fred Trump's buildings and he would over pay for it\nAnd not allow them to train millions of dollars of cash from his empire\nWhat a tennis say about this\n[noise] well tennis aren't a lot most parents were not happy about it they were aware that when they started doing this their rent started increasing significantly uh but they didn't know why and some of that was legitimate if you put a boiler into a building a regular building New York city you are allowed to raise the rent by some certain amount that they were getting rather extraordinary\nOr rent increases and we're in the process now talking to some of the tenants the buildings are um about how much they're rents are still artificially increased by the actions that Donald Trump and his siblings took in the Nineteen nineties\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nLet's get to a few of your comments now Craig tweeted Trump has been a con man from the get go his father taught him how to avoid paying taxes and Donald continues this theme today all the while blaming the Democrats for constructing law so he could get away with it legal or not he made a choice\nDoris tweeted the New York times article was lengthy fascinating and depressing as a retired realtor I recognize many of the tricks Donald Trump and his family used people usually lose their licenses some go to jail and\nIt's worth noting rushed by the way there there was a reference early in the investigation\nThat news organizations including the New York times or a little bit complicit in helping Donald Trump build this image I mean the number of reporters have said not just the times but a number of reporters have come forward in the last well I guess since Donald Trump became president\nAnd said shame on me for being so ... about this image of his wealth\nIt's been a problem for a long time I think part of that is the way our sort of celebrity culture\nAh works in this country you know Donald Trump came up through up became a public figure through sort of celebrity life\nNot as a public figure there was engaged in government or politics and and so he wasn't always taken very seriously was more like this novel the\nA spectacle that he created and it began in the Nineteen seventies that we mentioned an article that was prominently featured in New York Times and quite lengthy one of the first real profiles of Donald Trump on his own\nWhere he took a reporter on a tour of what he called his projects things he suggested he'd built and he owned\nUm and they were all through the many boroughs of New York city's things that his father owned and things that his father had built\nAnd it was through that like originally appropriating his father's wealth pretending that it was his own a vet he first ah landed on the Forbes List of the most wealthy Americans and once he was there\nThe sort of the guy was cast those lies got repeated over and over and over again and leave their way into the fabric of our culture and what people thought of Donald Trump and you know eventually were amplified\nA on The Apprentice if you watch that opening sequence of the practice which which first appeared in two thousand four it is just a brilliant one minute marketing campaign for what appears to be\nA a titan of business a self made billionaire and Donald Trump was was never any of that\nIt's kind of like the beginning of a Donald Trump infomercial in a way that really isn't really is and I\nThink in the minds of millions of Americans who saw him for the first time in the course of that show uh other than you know articles about his his his various marriages um that that really ...\nReally set the the the the cast for or how they view him and how they would remember him as he began to increasingly partake in public affairs\nHow how Suzanne how Fred Trump feel about this image that Donald Trump was cultivating the way that your article is written they've kind of suggests that that French Trump was not only okay with his image even by playing fast and loose with tax laws he kind of she was in on it he supported it\nWe find very much from when we started the reporting that that Donald received very little if any pushback from his father um there's times where he's quoted an article articles you know saying that you know Donald more brilliant than I Am and\nThese these things go on and Fred Fred we never see points where he he really push stock publicly\nBut there is one interesting moment in the story it becomes I think it really important um inflection point between a father and son and not softer you know decades of Fred Trump both I'm giving a his son Donald money a year and year out and loans and\nIncreasing those loans and money flow as Donald got into trouble in Nineteen Ninety Fred Trump is is you know at the final years of his life\nAround and the pushback came rather privately but Donald Trump had one of his lawyers are in in late Nineteen Ninety and this is the point of great financial distress in Donald Trump's life\nHe had a lawyer dropped a caught us all to his father's well essentially and knew well and that will that caught us all was presented to Fred Trump\nUm without Donald being there but by lawyers and fried shrimp um you know he flipped out he saw it as a way for his son uh he thought his son was trying to gain control of all of his empire and potentially put at risk so well you don't see a public um pushback by Fred I'm In fact you see 'em\nYou know you see a loving father there at every moment or not private moment you saw a very big pushback of of what Donald Trump was doing\nTo discuss what

I actually have an excellent question it's not something that we've looked into so far at this point um we do know that Donald Trump has done favors for his children who sold them apartments that well below market rate which is a means of transferring wealth\nBut they also work directly for him um and that opens the door to a a potential way to transfer of wealth without having to do some of these things because you can just pay them an extraordinary salary that maybe they wouldn't or anywhere else in the world for the work they're doing a as a way to sort of get your money into\nTheir hands and and the laws of also changed um you know in recent years that makes it easier to transfer I'm much more wealth without having to pay\n'em a state tax 'em and and so that also I think factors into exactly what he can transfer and how much tax will be paid on it it's if there's you know it's easier now to transfer wealth generationally by and paying less stocks\nWe should also be clear on what Donald Trump did actually build Becky tweeted Trump's supporters praised his business and leadership experience is any of that praise really deserve it really earned\nI Know he's had bankruptcies to his name at a huge head start from dad has he ever really made any wealth was any of it honest\n[noise]\nWell I think it would be a really hard to come to conclusion he has never had anything that's been financially successful there are a lot of examples beyond the casinos some of the buildings that we looked at that he built his\nGolf he's he's never had anything at all that's made money in The Apprentice his brand not show my\nMy point was to say it would be extreme to try to say that it's it's I don't think that's a wonderful I don't think anyone knows enough to say he's never made any money all in his own the my point I mean there are he has had a lot of businesses that have lost money but certainly there are some in there that have made money forty Wall Street's\nThe ... the one office building that he owns on his own it seems to have made some money for him but a lot of his enterprises\nEither lose money or are are just breaking and creating tax write offs for him\nIt's an open question as to how much does enterprise the things he built himself or kicking off and one has to wonder if that's part of the reason that he's a refused to release his tax returns that it might show that he's not as successful as a businessman um aside from being a personality as he said that he is\nNicholas tweeted what is really going to come from this it's hard not to be cynical anymore but unless criminal charges can be brought against him and his family what really changed his detractors will yell impeachment followers will say he's a smart businessman status quo remains Suzanne what would you say to Nicholas ... is going to come from this\nI think it's too early to say um in terms of the investigations both the city um New York city in New York state or looking at the allegations that were raised and the IRS maybe I just I think those are\nToo early days to conclude um what's gonna happen and we're going to be following those but I think on a larger level I think that this begins to reset the narrative of Donald Trump and where his fortune um where he got his fortune and we now understand that much more of it came\nFrom his father than previously known huge amount more than was previously known\nAnd um that tax fraud was involved um in him being able to get more than he might of that's going to you know I didn't take a while to to seep into the to the bloodstream of of the country and voters hum as you know but I think over time\nIt'll affect you know how his story is written going forward um that's important um to me as a reporter and somebody who values the Fox and that things are set straight so I think that's one thing that\nI'm you know I think will happen over time\nAnd what about you before we have to go you do to spent you spent well

Jacksonville\nOf terror people coast to coast including to living presidents targeted with suspicious packages where does the investigation stand and who did this from W. A. M. U. and NPR this is one [noise]\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson visiting Georgia Public broadcasting in Atlanta today on one a we begin with the search for suspected\nPipe bomb had been male to presidents Obama and Clinton CNN Robert De Niro and others right now there are tons of questions as to why this happened we'll focus on the investigation had been we shift gears to another high profile attack\nThe nerve gas poised to make a former Russian spy Sergei Skripal\nWho is he and why would the Kremlin want him dead\nWill speak to mark ... the only journalist known to have interviewed scribble and we'd love to hear from your comments on our Facebook page or tweet us ... one [noise]\nRight and so there are a couple of things we can we can discern right away one is that you know pipe bombs tend to be fairly a simple construction or there are there is such a thing as complex pipe bombs but most pythons are actually fairly simple so that's the starting off point\nThe other thing we know is that uh you know none of these have gone off\nSo there is there some reason to think that this person either was not a particularly good bomb maker or\nMay have designed a bomb that he in some fashion may not have wanted to go off a you know it's there's obviously you're obviously sending still a very stark message even if he's bombs don't explode\nAnd then when I Wonder if we should clarify that none of these bombs under these devices went off on site they did not go off where they were apparently intended they may well have detonated\nEmbalm squad custody if they chose to detonate them so I I I'm not sure maybe you know wetter than I Do whether these devices work capable of exploding or whether they were incapable of exploding but as far as we know there was no detonation that injured anyone right\nCorrect and and we've been told that\nThese were a these are viewed as a at least many of these devices reviewed as live explosives\nOr in the package now you can have a live explosive in a pipe\nThat is not a very well made bomb and is unlikely to go off for or maybe even very difficult to go off we don't know enough yet to nowhere on the spectrum that falls\nBut yes and and what they have but what they do have\nIs to to your question about destruction what they do have is they have as best we can tell ten unexploded pieces of ordinance which they can now come over for clues and that's a big deal to and to expose is the best the gators because they often don't have that they often have detonated material which is much harder to look through sometimes\nWe're speaking to Devlin Barrett who covers national security and law enforcement for the Washington Post well of course had much more to say on this story here on your NPR member station and on line at NPR dot org but for now we're glad to get some of your questions and thoughts about this will also be talking about this tomorrow on the friday news roundup for short\nLeery tweeted as a letter carrier I never thought just going to work and doing my job would feel like an act of defiance these are dark times civil\nAnd tell us more about the targets or at least the people whose names were listed on these devices we've already said that none of them was injured but how did they factor into the investigation\nRight and and the victim allergy what what\nA behavioral scientists called victim allergy of crime is very important because a lot of investigators will tell you who the victims are a show me the victims in al ... and I'll show you the criminal um and so the first I'm a that was discovered was founded the mailbox of George Soros a billionaire who finds a\nLiberal groups and and pro democracy groups around the world [noise]\nI'm a huge target of criticism from from the right wing\nOr and then very quickly after that we saw\nBomb sent to Hillary Clinton's residents to Iraq Obama's residence 'em to a John Brennan the Obama's former CIA director but that was a male to him at CNN [noise] uh and that got a lot of attention yesterday obviously um when they evacuated that building\nUm and so what you see a sort of a what what emerged from the ... at the pattern that emerged was essentially\nA a bunch of folks who have been a critical of President Trump or\nHave been sharply criticized by President Trump including congresswoman Maxine Waters another one of the intended recipients we're told and you know that leaves a lot of people to\nWonder what the political motivations of all this war um and obviously politics seems to be playing a part and the decision making process of this person\nUm but I always think you know criminals don't act necessarily rationally and we shouldn't try to impose too much reason our logic on what they're doing as early so I think we need to know a lot more before we can make any significant judgments as to as to what ... what precise message this person has tried to set\nFor sure and it's also worth noting that John Brennan the they sent this package to CNN but John Brennan is not a CNN contributor he's an NBC News contributor has been since I Believe this winter in the interest of full disclosure I'm an NBC News contributor also bought CNN has been a frequent target of the of the president in some of of his remarks did when were you trying to jump back in\n[noise] no I was just going to say so you know the target list suggest this is a person who uh is angry at or wants to scare or many of the people on the left that a Trump has criticized the most or people that have criticized Trump the most\nUm and what's interesting too is that you know one of these packages was addressed to former attorney general Eric Holder but we're told that had the wrong address on it and was essentially return to sender that alleged center or at least according to the package being Debbie Wasserman Schultz obviously they don't think she had anything to do with setting a bomb\nBut I I've spoken to investigators who think that because these packages all use to her as the return address this\nPerson has a particular antipathy toward her and that that Eric Holder package may well have been set deliberately mislabeled and hope that it would go to her office and and might hurt someone there [noise]\nUm we have to admit that when I hate to cut you short and then we got to move on and just a second I Do want to make sure we play a little bit of President Trump who opened his rally in Wisconsin last night by addressing these bomb threats his part of what the president said\nWe will find\nOn our\nSee\nThat at all or race or\nA a\nR O\nPart of President Trump's opening address in his rally in Wisconsin last night\nContrast that with what he tweeted this morning the president wrote quote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nFast unquote\nDevlin Barrett covers national security and law enforcement for the Washington Post Evelyn thanks for making time

visor dot com and from the sustaining members of this NPR station\nThis is one day I'm Joshua Johnson in the middle of a park in Salisbury England a young woman sat on the bench\nBeing against an older man that older man was former Russian spy Sergei Skripal he had been poisoned with a highly toxic nerve agent the young woman slumped against him was his daughter she had been poisoned to\nI mean on people who'd been on those planes the one coming from Moscow and the one coming from the U.S to try and reach out to them and have contact with him so that's why I chose and\nA ... a U. comes he lived a totally open eight that he\nWas on what we call the electrical register so he wasn't living ... that he and he also had some contact with\nA some a minute tree and educational organization so he'd come along to one or two places to give talks about the G O U or things like that and and you know because he had that little bit of interaction with the ... why the world will though he tried to keep a disgrace\nAnd low profile or that enabled me to sort of to get a handle on on how to find him\nWe are speaking to mark urban whose book this cripple files tells the untold story of Sergei Skripal by the way we know that there are some of you in our audience who heard his mentioned to the Americans and perked up we did a conversation about\nThe reality in the fiction of the Americans with two of the program show runners as well as a historian and a curator from the international Spy Museum you'll find that conversation on line at the one at a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nWhy did Sergei Skripal defect from the G argue I mean you mentioned that he had been doing some work for the British\nYes that's right well I mean he ... and I'm just going to be ... slightly up a nicotine ... where he he he was on a defector in the sense of somebody who contacted the British saying I Want to come across well can you do for for me he was an agent in place\nSo he was somebody who uh agreed to spy for my six while remaining\nIn the jail you and he was among the British ... indeed yeah that that the James Bond organization of of of fame and fiction so right so he he had decided that he was willing to trade secrets and I think he he had lost all faith in the people running Russia\nHe won't feed a ... if it ever came to that and of course he wanted payment for what he was doing so uh he was cultivated during the cools off a the spring and summer of Ninety Ninety six in Madrid where he was stationed\nBy a deep cover and my six officer who was essentially ... specifically to cultivation and they had various meetings with the ... they got more friendly and then of course eventually walking in the park in Madrid uh the the British guy ... the question\nAnd as a guy told me when when we were speaking\nBefore the poisoning that you know I was ready is the way he puts it he had these internal dialogue about who is who these posts and walls who he was talking to was he a spy for western agency then of course when the question was all things became much clear up\nAnd he was ready to to basically enter into this kind of agreement even knowing of course it could be extremely dangerous to themselves to do say\nLet's talk a little bit more about the poisoning attack he was attacked with a chemical nerve agent known as no shock Dr Steven ... was among those who are on the front lines of trying to save scruples life when he was brought into the hospital here as part of what Dr ... said at the time when we\nWere with was a an ice and\nWere expecting them not to survive we would try to therapy we would show the clinical cat\nBut all the evidence that they that they would not survive\nI imagine mark you've not had a chance to speak to mistrust ripple since he was poisoned but I Wonder what your take is on the use of poison first of all and poison like another shock which we said many times on this program\nIs kind of ... spoke to Russia it's it would be like if I shot someone with a bullet that I had signed my name too\n[noise] yes uh I mean first the no I haven't spoken to him since the poisoning I'm\nA I I think are the the assumption of your question about sending a message I think he's caught and important one um there are obviously ways that this could have been done I mean some people said well why didn't they just woke up to them in the streets and shoots him well\nIt's a user geo you will for so without dramatic cover to do that it would be very tricky from from an operation points of view because obviously someone might give chase a they'd be in ... that description would be every way they needed something that allowed them time to escape\nA now even having said that she didn't necessarily have to go with no Mitchell clearly there are other forms of poison ah and it was always intended to be absorbed through the skin\nAnd in a formulation actually that would absorb quite slowly very viscous formulation so that was the idea in in in in a sort of cold operational sense of why was he used but undoubtedly as you employed\nOr with your question it did carry a a distinct signature of something that has been a developed some effect they didn't ... I live in southern Russia during the Soviet period\nAnd was a quite distinctive in terms of its chemistry now in the early days off to the incident Russians tried to claim all sorts of people from the checks to the Swedes to the British themselves Ukrainians marches made this\nA then they sort of moved away from that law and then they don't tend to use it so much anymore but I think if we look at this um and we compare it for example to the case of ... who was a\nAnother former Russian intelligence officer who was\nWho was killed in London in two thousand ... string a different poison a radioactive isotopes ... and the ... on the nova chocolate very distinctive and you could say carried a Russian states should they be substances that\nOnly a very very small number of people in special the ... trees in Russia might get access to\n'em so although in theory you've got the idea is they may be someone was bribed to organized criminals into a hold of such material\nRight by law she can you can say ... and I think a lot of people do some of the people I spoke to in the intelligence business say then I it's designed to send a signal that while you tonight at the diplomatic level\nEverybody knows that it's you and the messages sent a if you ever consider working for western intelligence agency or not only will we try and catch\nAnd put you in jail for a long time but if you get away we'll try and come for you\nWill get some more questions with mark urban the author of the new book to ... to get some of your questions on the details of this as well Marco put some more of those to you\nAnd also get your sense of the aftermath of all this diplomatic ties that worsened and may be whether or not this saga is over or whether there was another chapter in this story that we should be keeping an eye out for stay close [noise]\nDo you suppose the world Trade Organization could just you know and the U.S trying to trade more\nThan maybe under the WTO will United States is not allowed to unilaterally to ratchet up the tariffs on Chinese I'm kind of resolve footing the trade war just attack\nExamine marketplace week nights at six on eighty nine nine W.
