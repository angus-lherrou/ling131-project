{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Also last year judge Kavanaugh will argue it in the dissent in the Texas case that Jane Doe should not be able to exercise her right to choose\nBecause she did not have family and friends\nHelp her make the decision\nIf adopted this argument\nCould rewrite Supreme Court precedent and require courts to determine whether a young woman had a sufficient support network when making her to the decision even in cases as is and this one where she had gone before a court\nHis reasoning demonstrates the judge Kavanaugh not only is willing to disregard president but his opinions failed to appreciate the challenging realities women face when making these most difficult decisions\nWhen I asked him about whether row and Casey we're settled law and whether they weren't correctly decided he refused to answer he would only say these cases are entitled to respect\nRoving weight as we all know is one of a series of cases that have held an individual's right to decide who to Mary where to send your children to school what kind of medical care you can receive at the end of life as well as\nYou're listening to live special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some of the Senate speeches today is where your way to vote on the ending of debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court\nNPR's Kelsey Snell is at the Capitol and listening along with us and Kelsey I just want to know something is Dianne Feinstein the\nSenior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee begins her speech here Chuck Grassley of Iowa primarily focused on the lack of evidence against Brett Kavanaugh the accusations that have delayed this nomination and made allegations of democratic conspiracies a left wing groups a shaming us all as Grassley pointed\nFeinstein has returned to more traditional ground of arguing about Kavanaugh's judicial record and her disagreements with ah with him and and her suspicions that he's been placed on the court to overturn roe versus Wade or something like\nYeah I think that's partially because Democrats have more or less identified a three part strategy about cabinet they want to remind all of their voters that even if they do not weigh in on this if Kavanaugh is confirmed\nThat they fought on both his credentials so the his position particularly on role and on on gun control those are two major issues that Democrats have been talking about\nThey also want to make the argument about that the what we have heard the past several weeks that the issue about his behavior in high school and college and the allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd the third thing is that they want to focus on the unfairness of this process and the fact that he they believe that he revealed himself to be a partisan during\nThe last hearings so they are going to hear them throughout the rest of today and now on those three ideas because what they want to do is they want to remind voters that and this midterm election coming up is their chance to make a choice about who makes these decisions who has the majority and who should be in ... in control of the house and Senate\nScott Detrow we've really seen that that temperament that partisanship argument pickup in the weeks since the hearing ... when Kavanaugh was so confrontational with Democratic senators and that's one reason why\nHe had a remarkable op ed in the wall Street Journal last night saying I may have been too emotional during that time for the during the confirmation hearing last week arguing he would be an impartial judge on the bench\nA he said that we couldn't quite say what was that he would have taken back I said some things I shouldn't have said they didn't specify let's return to the Senate floor where Dianne Feinstein is still speaking here on here a little bit more of her speech\nHaitian on guns because of widespread ownership in this country I'm also concerned about his views on presidential power specifically he has said that sitting president cannot be indicted cannot be prosecuted should not be investigated\nAnd should have the authority to fire a special counsel at well in other words the president and the United states is above and outside the law\nThese views raised serious concerns that should concern us all especially at a time when the president continually threatened to fire the leadership of the department of justice for failing to be loyal and raining in the mall or investigation\nThese views alone or not sufficient for me to vote against judge Kavanaugh but what we have seen and experienced in the past several weeks has raised serious new concerns\nConcerns I Believe shouldn't worry is all judges are expected to be quote even handed unbiased impartial and courteous and call however at the hearing last week\nWe saw a man filled with anger and aggression\nJudge Kavanaugh raised his voice he interrupted senators he accused of them than Democrats of quote lying in wait and quote and replacing quote advice and consent with search and destroy and quote he even went so far\nAs to say that Dr Ford's allegations\nWere nothing more than quote a calculated and orchestrated political hit\nHealed with pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election and quote quote revenge on behalf of the Clintons and\nHow could he says the have hair revealed hostility and belligerent that is becoming a someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme court his display was so shocking\nThat more than two thousand four hundred law professors\nFrom around the country have expressed their opposition they wrote and I quote instead of trying to sort out with reason and tear the allegations that were raised\nJudge Kavanaugh responded in and in temperate inflammatory and partial manner as he interrupted and at times was this courteous to\nDianne Feinstein of California making her arguments here before the and vote to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh talking about the judge's temperament during\nHis testimony last week Nina Totenberg what are you learning about\nThe what we saw the Justice John Paul Stevens the retired from the Supreme Court last night he was raised Kevin out in the past said he said he'd changed his mind after he saw this performance\nI've talked to some of Kavanaugh's colleagues on the bench on both Republican appointees in democratic twenties and they were really shocked by what they call the dropping of a veil they never knew was there where\nHe talked about a conspiracy to get revenge for the Clintons because he was part of the Ken Starr investigation no evidence for that but that was his view and extended under oath\nYeah and and they never seen that and were shocked\nOkay Nina Totenberg is going to remain with us as we continue our coverage here today and let's just review very briefly where we are and then in a moment we're going to take a break and continue hearing the speeches here\nSo continue hearing the speeches today\nCharles Grassley of Iowa lead off today alleging that left wing groups have quote shame does all\nWith their effort to stop Brett Kavanaugh he said that Senate investigators had been tracking down virtually all leads and that there was nothing in an FBI report we did not already know about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that it's time to confirmed this man Dianne Feinstein speaking right now saying that this is a judge willing to disregard president who believes that the president of the United states is above and outside the law\nAnd a man

to eighty nine nine devil Jaycee T Jacksonville on a friday mostly sunny this afternoon upper eighties will have an east when this afternoon about five to eight miles per hour clear tonight Seventy four degrees and mostly sunny for your Saturday with a high near nice\nTo have an actual coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well and one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote\nThe Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend I Will say okay\nAnd executive who's on accountable\nTo the law the sworn to uphold\nA head of state\nWho while in office\nShould be beyond the reach\nCriminal investigations or civil investigations\nThis moment in American history demands deep skepticism about judge Kavanaugh's views on executive power\nNominated as he was by an executive who just stains the constraints of his office\nAnd who is at this very moment\nThe apparent subject of investigations his Supreme Court nominee\nBelieves should be invalid\nI met with judge Kavanaugh for almost two hours I asked him\nAbout all of those issues\nHis answers were constantly invasive\nAn orderly unsatisfactory\nWas deja vu all over again in the first round of hearings\nWhen judge Kavanaugh deliberately avoided talking about his views on roe\nPresidential accountability and more\nThere was no legal reason rule or ...\nThat prevented him\nFrom being clear and saying what he thought\nBecause he knows that his views are deeply at odds\nWith the progress America has made\nOver the last century of jurisprudence\nWith what most Americans believe\nHis performance was not only unfair and frustrating to the Senate\nIt was unfair to the American people\nWhen the nominee refuses to disclose their views\nChances are you have a nominee whose views are far outside the mainstream of America\nWhether they be far right we're far left\nMy colleagues on the other side of the trial\nMay not have as grave concern about these views as we do\nBut let no American be surprised\nIf judge Kavanaugh\nBecomes a decisive vote\nTo restrict the rights and privileges of the American people\nWhile stretching the bounds of privilege for the current occupant of the White House\nJudge Kavanaugh's nomination ultimately\nDoes not only encompassed questions of ideology or credentials\nBut questions of character\nJudge Kavanaugh falls woefully short of what Americans expect and deserve\nAnd the Supreme Court justice\nHe has repeatedly misled the Senate\nAbout his involvement in some of the most serious controversies of the Bush administration\nIncluding warrantless wiretapping of American citizens our policy against torture the theft of electronic records from Democratic senators\nAnd his involvement in the nomination a very controversial judges\nFaced with credible allegations of various types of misconduct\nJudge Kavanaugh's credibility was again tested\nAnd he continued to dissemble and even ... barricade\nAbout easily refuted facts\nBeyond the issue of credibility judge Kavanaugh presented to the Senate the bitter is partisan testimony I have ever heard\nFrom a candidate seeking the Senate's approval whether they be for the bench or the executive branch\nNow there are many who thinks that what happened\nWhen judge Kavanaugh was Seventeen years old should not be this positive\nHis actions at age fifty three\nIn terms of demeanor\nAnd above all credibility should be dispositive judges at every level of the federal bench should be held to the highest standard of ethics and morals character\nJudges at every level\nShould be judicious incredible and independent\nBut especially especially on the Supreme Court\nI Do not see how it's possible\nFor my colleagues to say was perfect confidence\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the temperament\nOn the United States Supreme court\nSo I asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why judge Kavanaugh\nThere is no dictate\nThat you have to march blindly forward with a nominee when there are other is available to you\nThere are many judges\nWho I Am sure conservatives would be happy to have on the court\nI'd remind my colleagues\nThe seat that Brett Kavanaugh aspires to fill\nWas held by a justice who assumed the bench after one nominee was voted down by the Senate\nAnd the second nominee withdrew his nomination\nBut the Republican majority\nHas press forward blindly\nOn judge Kavanaugh\nEven when brave women came forward to speak truth to power\nFor what cause for the sake of winning\nThat's not reason enough\nMy colleagues on the other side\nIf you have doubts about judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nAbout his ability to tell the truth\nAbout his ability to be impartial and nonpartisan\nNo matter what you think of his jurisprudence\nOr what he may or may not have done in high school and college\nYou should not vote to confirm him\nSo my friends\nDemocrat and Republican\nFor all the controversy\nAll the heavy hand in the process\nAll the hyperbole and vilification uh both sides\nWe can salvage some decency\nHere at the end\nIf judge Kavanaugh was rejected\nPresident Trump will select another nominee\nLikely right of center\nProbably not to my liking\nBut without the cloud\nHangs over this nominee\nAnd we can proceed to consider that nominee and much less\nBitter much better less partisan way\nA bipartisan majority of senators\nConsidering fully the weight of judge Kavanaugh's testimony record credibility\nTrustworthiness and temperament\nConsidering fully\nHeartbreaking testimony\nOr doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nCan vote to reject judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nAnd asked the president\nTo send the Senate\nAnother name\nMy colleagues will do so\n[noise]\nThat's Charles Schumer the Senate minority leader and we're waiting on Mitch McConnell the majority leader next Charles Schumer making the point argument arguing the Democrats have not delayed this nomination divisions among Republicans have done so\nThose listening to this speech and others include David Axelrod former adviser to President Obama he's now on the line Mr actual rock and mourning mourning what are you hearing there [noise]\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of a sound and fury on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and\nTo be the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice Kavanaugh by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination\nEvery one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes\nYou ever cash and the Senate\nNow the stakes are always hot for U.S Supreme court nomination\nBut college the extraordinary events of original wage have raised them even higher this time\nWhen we vote later this morning\nWe will not only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly\nWell qualified judge Shaw harsh court\nNot anymore out after all this\nUnited States Senate will also\nBe making a shape\nThat partisan politics can override the presumption of medicine\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEvery one is innocent until proven guilty will either state\nThat factor that evidence\nCan simply be brushed aside line politically inconvenient\nAnd signal that media bullying\nAnd mob and ...\nAre valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case\nAlthough sign up and say that serious thoughtful\nFact based deliberation\nThey were dumped on judge Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd restless leg\nBreathless lay the media sees on them the more outlandish the better\nAmericans who are informed the judge Kavanaugh mastermind violent drug gangs as a young teenager\nUntil that accuser Walker story that\n\nWe were informed that judge Kavanaugh beat someone up on a boat in Rhode Island harbor\nUntil that accused are total Eric had it\nWhere it another tall tale of physical assault until that account was thoroughly debunked by sitting federal drug\nOh yes we were informed a juvenile jokes in his high school yearbook were actually sinister secret references\nAll of the Keystone Cops were all in the case\nKeystone Cops were all in the case\nAnd Senate Democrats\nCheered them all\nParts of this uncorroborated unbelievable mudslide\nEnd of the Senate record\nThey sided them in an official letter demanding a judge Kavanaugh's nomination be withdraw\nWell of course that was quite beside the point\nQuite beside the point\nSo long as they were convenient\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the fact free verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail\nBut they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say around here\nThe Senate will have the files\nSo madam president we're almost at the end of the runway\nThe cross rounds of anger and fear and partisanship have blown strong\nThese past weeks\nThey harm a good man\nHave tarnished the dignity of this institution\nBut all of it going to end it at\nThe time has come to vote\nCenter stands on the threshold of a golden opportunity\nWe have the opportunity to advance the nomination of an incredibly well qualified and well respected jurors to oppose that demands such action ones we have the opportunity to put judge Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court\nWhere his distinguished service will make us and our nation proud\nBut we have the opportunity\nToday we can send a message to the American people\nThat's some core principles remain unfettered by the partisan passions\nFacts matter\nFairness matters\nThe presumption of innocence is soccer suck\nThe senator started back on these things before madam president but never for law\nAnd never without deep regret\nThis institution does outlook back proudly on the era of Joseph McCarthy\nOr on any of the other times when the politics of personal destruction poison\nNo no the Senate looks back on those things was shy and when the conviction that we cannot go down that road again\nWe know the Senate is better than this\nWhen all of the nation deserve better than this\nBack and farming judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court this brilliant jurors will be charged with a holding the rule of law\nAnd honoring American Justice\nWe must hold ourselves to that very same standard\nWe must choose the golden opportunity before us today\nTo confirm Supreme Court justice\nWho will make us proud and\nKorea from our own commitment to the justice\nThat every single American deserves\n\nAs a room that's Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader the Republican leader wearing a red tie with spectacles reading from his speech\nAdjust now calling him the vote there were about to hear about today one of the most consequential votes you've ever had that is what he described was listened to the uh the action on the floor now\nTo be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Senate Seventeen senators\nTo anonymous consent of the medical records probably was\nAny action by unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call has been weighed the question is is it the sense of the Senate debate on the nomination Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to close\nThe ... the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the Rome history Alexander\nOkay recalling the role this is not formally when the votes will be registered that will take a little while uh but we will learn over the next number of minutes how this vote has turned out\nWe should mention the speeches we've just heard are effectively speeches in one sense for an audience of four because they're only about four lawmakers maybe another that we don't quite know about\nWho are in any way undecided here uh Murkowski of Alaska flake of Arizona Collins of Maine Manchin of West Virginia NPR's Scott Detrow has been following their progress there's some news about Susan Collins\nYeah we've been saying all morning that this is a key test vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination but it is not necessarily the final tally Susan Collins confirmed that saying she is going to vote yes this morning on Kavanaugh but that she will announce her final decision on this weekend's final vote later today people\nJust joining us may ask wait a minute what final decision if she's voting yes isn't that a yes\nThat is usually the case but there are lots of moments where where senators will vote to advance the nomination to a final vote and then change their mind at the last moment most high profile example of that John McCain last year round\nBecause we just heard the question on the floor is is it the sense of the Senate that were done with debate in effect to paraphrase what the resolution is that they're voting on you can vote to end debate and still vote against the nominee if you should want to do that there is one ah let's give it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suspect this would have been it a bigger difference because he knew that that was a pressure point for him that was why\nThey hearings were not in the middle or ... ... why they didn't start in the middle or the end of September ... that's n and perhaps go in and be the final vote the after the election\nThat charge always always was and it was always directed by McConnell in consultation with ... let's get a nominee fast let's get him get and get him here like ... or her here early in September and use it to as a club for Democrats who are up for re election in red state\nNow just mentioned as we're talking we have the line open to the Senate floor so when the presiding officer opens the microphone to announce the final count and everybody's now recorded at fifty one forty nine we will hear that\nA Ron Elving is listening along with us it does appear though that the vote unless something dramatically changes his last second it's fifty one to forty nine that's actually one vote more than they would need ride Ron Elving\nThat's right because if there had been a time which we do not have that would be broken by vice president Mike Pence who has the constitutional power to break tie let's give a listen approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate galleries\nThat was just a reminder of from the gallery here let's see if more set on this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine the gavel comes down Brett Kavanaugh advances to a final vote in the United States Senate there you have a\nCloture fifty one to forty nine or not the closest to vote in the history of the Supreme Court Nina Totenberg but pretty close to the closest\nI think the closest for some time in the Eighteen hundreds but this is this uh this is one vote difference a Clarence Thomas was confirmed by it to vote margin and there are senators who\nWho said afterwards that had they known it was that close that they could have made a difference\nAnd I think it was ... were in Redmond in Bill Cohen we're prepared to vote against Thomas huh but Bob Dole\nAre said to them I've got the vote and they figured I Need this stuff from do I like a new antagonize him so they they went ahead now don't may have had more votes in his pocket that he didn't need to fall maybe there were eleven Democrats who voted for the plane as time is maybe had another one\nBut in any case he got up into the mid fifties and here we have fifty one it's not the final vote but it's hard to see on the final vote this going much higher than fifty one very hot and we know\nI in fact we don't know that he'll get fifty one absolutely because senators can vote differently on the final measure in a moment I'm hoping to go outside of the United states Capitol you hear what the response has been to protesters if this news is I'm sure the news is spreading very rapidly outside the United states Capitol\nAh I'd like to ask Ron Elving about having having studied the history of all this is you have what's your sense of this moment\n[noise] one moment at this one ... at this particular moment is that those ten senators we were just mentioning who are Democrats running in states Donald Trump one and twenty sixteen nine of the ten have voted against cloture Joe mansion was the lone\nA Democrat to vote for cloture and he is one of those ten even though it is also necessary to say that he seems not to be in this much trouble as some of the others he seems to be on his way to re election but he did not want to be apparently the Democrat who made it a tie vote\nI to be the corresponding a vote that would have forced Mike Pence to break\nThat particular talk about in historical terms of this is quite unusual because until last year if you had\nFifty one or forty nine votes in this case against culture\nYou did not get cloture that's right you seem to be had had a sixty votes and and when we talk about Mitch McConnell and his ... significant maneuverings over the years none is more important than his decision to change the filibuster rules so that it would apply that\nThat the filibuster would not apply or not be usable when we came to Supreme Court nominees he changed that last year for Neil Gorsuch and now of course it's still in place\nI Want to take notice something that you just said there Ron Elving because you said that there are ten Democrats who are seen as vulnerable who are in states that voted for Donald Trump who might see some advantage and voting for the Supreme Court nominee and nine of them chose to vote no and the one who did choose to vote yes seemed to have an option he could have voted no but he decided that he wanted to vote\nYes we presume that so many of these lawmakers so much of the time or making shameless short term political calculations uh [laughter] the evidence is overwhelming that that is very often drew and yet it is not necessarily always true and we heard just yesterday Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nWho is extremely vulnerable uh who seems possibly on her way to defeat who chose to vote no announced her no vote and the immediate political analysis was well there goes her Senate reelection\nBut China and whatever she said what she said was this isn't a political vote I just couldn't face myself when I got up in the morning if I voted that way that is true I've known to many other women like this\nAnd and she is behind in North Dakota biased mouthed about as much as ... imagine is ahead in West Virginia so these are different calculations look at somebody like Claire McCaskill in Missouri whose races absolutely neck and neck\nShe also chose to vote no and a number of these Democrats did vote for Neil Gorsuch he got three democratic votes isn't that right now I think that's I think he got three democratic votes and\nUm and it was assumed that those people would be under tremendous pressure to vote yes again on another Trump nominee even if he were conservative as Brett Kavanaugh is until we got to the allegations of sexual assault and that raised a whole new set of questions\nAnd and so did the cabin up performance at the hearing it wasn't just Christine Blasey Ford who was I think\nBy what the Republicans on Republicans on the judiciary\nCommittee said they believed her they just didn't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president of the United states admitted that she was a credible with it yeah so they decided to buy something\nRed Kavanaugh's performance which she\nSorted kind to apologize for in the wall Street Journal editorial that performance was unlike anything anybody had ever seen by a nominee I think that's one thing that a Chuck Schumer said that is absolutely on debatable um there were things that both Schumer and\nMcConnell set in their closing arguments that I thought were poignantly true for the country for the Senate for the shambles that this was I don't think this was a one way street by any means nobody comes away from this either side with completely clean hands but\nIt it evolved or at\nThe end into the worst spectacle imaginable for the Supreme Court of the United states uh and its standing which is really only a almost an emotional standing that it has that people follow what it says because they believe in it and for the Senate if the United\nStates well let's review some of the remarks that were made in those speeches before the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination Chuck Schumer of New York described Kavanaugh's testimony as the bitter wrist\nPartisan testimony in memory\nHe said that this was a nominee who had a hard right conservative George jurisprudence and then the dam broke there were questions about him according to Schumer and the dam broke with credible allegations of sexual assault decades ago while he was in high school a completely opposite picture painted by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky saying that\nHidden sinister meetings had been found an innocent statements by Kevin on the past that he suffered great and dignity that there was no corroborating evidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this was one of the most consequential votes you've ever\nHad and it's a vote that went for Kavanaugh\nThis is special coverage from NPR News\nThe Florida Times union editorial staff\nProbably present Jay a new magazine dedicated Indian editorial staff probably presented to the rebirth

China for five to sway public opinion in America and first lady millennia Trump visits Africa were also across the Brett Kavanaugh vote in the Senate\nBut in the meantime let's review this week's top global headlines\nComments on our Facebook page or tweet us ... won a [noise]\nAnd the accusations that they've been involved in a poisoning people around the world so I think they're hitting back every time they're being criticized or they're being ah they're they're hitting back\nAnd the G are you this is a Russian military intelligence that we didn't hear about for a long time it was not part of the old KGB which you may recall was broken up but they've really been at the center for the past decade of of ... all most or all of these big Russian hacking scandal\nVivian the department of justice has brought charges against seven Russian officers Scott Brady is the attorney general for the western district of Pennsylvania here's part of what he had to say this is not spy versus spy these were not passive intelligence gathering operations\nThis is a criminal conspiracy which caused real harm to real victims when the G O U publishes us athletes most private insensitive medical information to embarrass our national sports federations we're all made more vulnerable\nThat's attorney general Scott Brady from the wars of the attorney from the western district of Pennsylvania Vivian I what we've mentioned this on the program before\n... it's almost feels like it was meant to be seen like some of his was meant to be noticed it if it feels very godfather to me like when when there was a hit you don't clean up the blood you want people to see that something happened and no we did this and we can do worse\nWell I mean and this is the tactic that the Russians have Easter time and time again where they like to leave by comes hum when they do these kinds of attacks and especially in the cyber realm where it might be a little bit harder to to\nTo detect exactly the source of an attack you really could be completely anonymous and ... and a lot of these cases if you wanted to be but the Russians like to kind of mark their territory and say you know ... it's kind of send a message to the world and say we have the ability to do this and\nEssentially put everyone on notice and on guard and so that's exactly exactly what they've done not just to the U.S but around the world\nAnd just to clarify that title sorry Scott Brady the U.S attorney for the western district to Pennsylvania sorry about that is the friday news roundup with Vivian ... of the wall Street Journal NPR's Greg Myre ... and the New York times reporter David Sanger David he wanted to jump back\nYeah just to stink observation I think on on a ... point here which is\nDoing these indictments against people who will never see in us courtrooms publishing their photographs as ah the British and the Dutch did is based on an assumption that there is a deterrent effect in embarrassing the Russians by revealing what they've been doing\n... exactly right since some of this is meant to show your power\nIt's not clear to me that Vladimir prudent is embarrass people here in fact he may like the additional publicity that comes from this considering that there are no real penalties to him a vein for their guys got thrown out of of\nUh you know Amsterdam after being caught thirty minutes into their operation um\nWhat does that tell you it tells you that we still have not figured out the core issues with how to deter cyber attacks and the old assumptions that doing it in secret is the goal is wrong and you know there was a moment when after President Trump\nMet ... in ... a year ago and I kept us in the perfect weapon he came out of that meeting and he called me from air force one to make the point that flooding recruiting had told him the Russians are so good at cyber\nThat if they had done the DNC hack they never would have been caught\nIn a letter potent argue old Donald ... that that that were so good at what we do that if we had done the DNC hack you never want to know you never would have seen us and the president called you to tell you that to\nTell me this end to end the he's since made this argument in public uh many times and he called me they say so that sounds about right and I said well you know Mr President I don't think that was the intent
