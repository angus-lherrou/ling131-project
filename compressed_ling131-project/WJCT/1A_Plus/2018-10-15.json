[noise]\nWhat Brecht said on the rise in a three hundred year old British territory is caught between a rock and a hard place we want to remain British\nThat means we have to leave the EU if that means that we have to take an economic hit then so be it\nOn ... all the rock of Gibraltar breaks it next time a marketplace week nights at six or eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. [noise]\nHoly on Castro has been mayor of San Antonio and served in President Obama's cabinet this summer he spent time speaking in Iowa and he just published a memoir\nAre you thinking what I'm thinking\nOf your questions for potential presidential hopeful young Castro next on on one hand weekdays at ten after first coast to that on eighty nine nine\nW. J. C team your community your world\n\n\n[noise] well finally this hour the jaguars turned in their worst performance of the year over the weekend\nOut in Dallas [noise]\nJust have so much colpepper is here now hey good morning\nGood morning I Would call it an ass in big the ad wars of the oh in the D. didn't show up and uh neither did the special teams all around just an awful performance\nForty to seven the loss of the cowboys are the worst loss of the team in fact since twenty Fifteen you might remember when the patriots just absolutely blitzkrieg them up in New England I Will say this or any team have a bad day any defense can to the fence as it is currently constituted\nIs that enough struggles to say that until they get healthy the jaguars shouldn't expect all that much on that side of the ball but let's talk about the defense this is the U.S has been talking all year\nAbout wanting to be historically great so for some perspective\nLook to most dominant defenses in the last forty years the eighty five bears and the two thousand ravens each had a bad day at the office the jaguars actually scored thirty six on the ravens that year when they said the scoring record the ravens did defensive scoring record\nOf the dolphins beat the bears scoring thirty eight on them on a Monday Night football game back in eighty five the differences those two teams didn't have to bad days of the office so at the jaguars want to continue to\nTalk about themselves in those kind of context mhm yes they have to win a championship but first they've got to just not do what they did yesterday too many miscommunication issues not enough police being made at the jaguars are going to turn this thing around as a team I think the defense has to be the catalyst they need to create more turnovers\n... points as crazy as that sounds\nAnd don't let opponents get out to a big leads the second straight week the team has gotten out to a twenty plus point lead by half time because this team is just not built to play from behind so there are certainly more work to do big question here what do you say after performance like that well here's what some of the jaguars were saying after the game\nBefore and I mean starting with me I've got to do a better job at all the players [noise] we've got a coach better we go play better I don't think there are there and again we don't have that you know you could say well hey we we go to build on it is a build on that um you know right now we've got to give back we've got to get to work [noise]\nUm my responsibility I think some responsibility for it and I will get the same right\nTo describe it means is a pretty much a waste of a day and the trip and um you know not not by any means but we expected to do or we're planning on doing ah give him credit they played well and we played once again pretty\nBad ... it'll move the roof of what they're going to go to revert to the struggle for him to\nDo you believe somewhat ... and ... and the group of guys a row\nBut I Will have to do with a job after that we're fine we're fine\nYeah and those tell them Smith the last one saying we'll let you all have it out we're fine ... maybe I mean let's let's be honest you don't have the kind of performance as the jaguars they they were mediocre last week he gives a very good Kansas City often this week against are you in offices have been struggling in Dallas to give up forty so I'm going to get fixed in a hurry\nYeah so ah they were ... three and three at this point last year what are they now same record\nThree and three so I mean that listen it doesn't mean that the season's over by any stretch of the imagination it's the warning signs of what we're seeing here with the last couple of weeks the injuries piling up on the fence and\nAh the defense not perform this team has to be led by the defense right now the defense in running game and when you met Leonard pointed out with the injury the running game is going to be hampered uh there's some real serious work to do for the jaguars right now\nOn the other hand the gators had their biggest come from behind when on the road over the weekend in the history of the franchise at the school\nReally impressive vote come from behind the effort against Vander does Vanderbilt it wasn't like they did was he was Alabama but he's still an FCC team and I can't remember a team changing the perception of himself and such a short period of time\nRemember the gators lost the Kentucky was like oh here we go again but since then they've ruled out five straight wins they are ... you can just tell how much better coach they are under ... and they were previously ...\nFor no foreign want an FCC play and they're coming to Jacksonville after a by week for the Georgia Florida game in Georgia last over the weekend ... teams with the same record in the conference\nA and this makes this Georgia Florida game\nSo important in the SEC east including wind up impacting the national title picture I'm not saying that Ford is going to go to the national championship game\nBut with Georgia remember last year they lost one game worse than they did against LSU they lost to Auburn and still wind up playing for the national championship so because they've been racial highly or they do have a shot the right now in the polls Georgia is a\nFlorida is eleventh and I should say as well uh one other team of of note in the polls UCF has won Nineteen straight games down in Orlando mayor right tense in the country now if they go ... season undefeated there's going to be a lot of clamor that the night should have a shot at the championship\nHas well nights so what are your Florida Georgia plans\nWell I'll be in London so I hung I'll be covering the jaguars game in London that comes on the same weekend this year so uh I Will not have any of the fun that I had last\nYear I roll under ... anything like that as\nSoon as I probably depends on how badly I just you

T Jacksonville your community your world take your umbrella we could have an isolated shower anytime after two today it will be partly sunny up to Ninety in the afternoon and down to Seventy three tonight\nOnly on Castro has plenty to say about today's politics and where America might be headed will he tried to turn his politics into policy that's our next president\nFrom W. A. M. U. and NPR in Washington this is one\nYou there I'm Joshua Johnson today on a holy on Castro some consider him a twenty twenty presidential contender he's a former Obama Cabinet secretary former mayor of San Antonio and a regular on the Democratic speaking circuit we'll get to know who the Castro head also the latest on ... to Saudi American journalist she's reporting may have gotten him till\nThis morning President Trump tweeted that Saudi Arabia's king denied knowing anything about the show he said how does a close and\n... I Am a obviously I've been to New Hampshire twice I've been to Iowa twice I'm seriously considering running for president I'm going to make a decision after the November election and before the end of the year\nWhat's the biggest variable for you in terms of whether it's a yes or no in terms of your candidate\nA couple of things the first one is personal um my family and I have talked about it of course and um um my wife has always been wonderful and very supportive\nThroughout my time in public service at the same time there's no question that that this is a bigger deal it's a bigger endeavor than anything that we have done and so we need to have a longer conversation about that\nAnd then secondly ah I'm getting out into the country right now to different states as I help candidates who are on the ballot in twenty Eighteen and I'm getting a sense of where the countries that\nAnd I think we'll also get a sense of that in November I Believe that these November elections set a mood they set a tone for the next couple of years and there is no absolute rushed to make a decision right\nI don't know anybody who doesn't feel like the November elections are going to say something cogent about where the country is right now I Wonder what this process has been like for you of of kind\nStrong border enforcement uh\nFolks should also understand that right now we have some of the lowest numbers of people coming across the southern border uh than we've had in forty years and my hope is that\nUh that\nThroughout this debate that we've been having than we are going to continue to have that more and more people understand the facts and that some of these misperceptions about immigrants is just criminals or or immigrants as just a drain on society that folks get the facts\nI hate to be a downer but I think we know that fact St worth what they used to be these days I mean facts facts don't necessarily want elections you got to make an emotional argument to get elected than the facts come into play when you make policy or how do you work around that and especially now when people are just so\nTicked off about everything that getting them you hear facts off and it's just not happening\nYeah let me say two things uh number one that's why it's so important in our society to invest in public education\nTo invest from the very beginning and an educated um society I think all of us want our kids to be able to to you know grow up and have a sense of both history and also be able to find the facts for themselves that's why it's\nImportant that we have a thriving um newspaper and media industry because they felt they helped keep us informed and focus on the facts\nBut then also let me address your point about emotion one of the most emotional things\nThat I've heard in the last few months was that audiotape of the little girl who was crying out in that detention center for ah her mother and her aunt\nOr an thought in that moment that she was going to get to call\nHer and and um kept crying out for her mom or dad or so\nWe ought to make decisions based on facts but if you're talking about emotion or I don't think that we've seen anything worse than what Donald Trump is done to all of those children who are still separated from their parents and every night you know that they're crying in some Baron detention center\nOr so you know we can go at it either way\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nAnd we've only got you for a few more minutes let's see if we can get through a bunch more questions before we'll let you go\nThe baking man tweeted if secretary Castro runs for president well he tried to bring the Democratic party back to center and be a bit more moderate or will he ride an extreme left wave which is where it seems to be going at the moment I'm asking as a moderate let me add to that a little bit of context former U.S attorney general Eric Holder\nUsing Georgia just over a week ago speaking to a group of Democrats and told them it's time for Democrats to be as tough and dedicated and committed as Republicans he kinda referenced that line from former first lady Michelle Obama when they go low we go high hears what Eric Holder said next\nSays you know when they go low [noise] [laughter]\nThey go low we can [noise]\nAnd then a few\nMinutes later he clarified saying he didn't mean Democrats needs to do anything inappropriate but I also noted they didn't exactly gas they collapse like a lot of Democrats feel like you know of Republicans won the election by basically punching us in the face and stepping on American values you know why or why the hell are we still playing nice\nWell in this you know I I'll I'll let a kind of a turning general low holder or you know speak to what he thinks we should do um I I Would say that um you\nDo have this divide out there right now amongst Democrats some who want this Michael ... style in your face give Trump what he gives us a versus folks who won a more hopeful vision for the future in a manner that I think a bronco Obama painted ten years ago\nAnd um it's understandable why folks want that you know in your face style I Do think that we have to stand up for what we believe in um we have to be very forthright and blunt I'm at the same time\nIf you look at the history of this country and you look at um the the Democrats that have prevailed in presidential elections are they painted a hopeful vision\nFor the future of the country are and so I I Believe that that is the right path ultimately\nTo comments about just your visibility your name recognition black ... yeah I could vote for Castro might be an issue in the Cuban community in Florida different Castro's people different Castro's\nRSP sale wrote on our website I'm Glad takes us politicians are getting some of the national limelight I don't think ... and ... are the best examples for for individual roared a Democrat who's running for the U.S Senate\nIn Texas how is the name recognition game going for you just in terms of getting people to know who you are and what you're about\n[noise] uh well I mean you know my brother and I have both been active um of course in Texas but uh now across the country for the last few years um if I decided to run for president I guess I'll concern myself more about that ah remember that\nThat the president a primary is not a national election is a state by state primary and caucus election\nOn so folks need to do the hard work and Iowa New Hampshire or the other early states\nUh to to be able to do well of course raising your name id nationally and that leads to your ability to fundraise is important um but you know basically been out there I'm making sure that the folks who are going to get the call 'cause uh if I decide to run or that they get to know me\nOne more question I Would ask you mentioned your twin brother who is a congressman you talk a lot about him particularly in the early parts of the book and how you two were the most competitive twin brothers who ever lived there for how was having a twin affected the way you view politics\nUm\nThat's a good question I don't think anybody's asked me the question in that way I Would just say you know uh what's interesting about being a twin is that everybody sees you the same way right like you're part of the package your in your group feel\nI'm a package deal and I guess it's helped me to understand issues of identity and how people think about themselves in politics\nUm because I grew up and everybody saw me as part of\nSomebody else who young Castro the new book is called an unlikely journey waking up from my American Dream secretary Castro it's been a pleasure thanks for talking to us thanks for having me\nComing up we don't want to lose sight of the

E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase Jamie diamond bill Ford who is the executive chairman or Ford Motor company Larry fink who's a CEO of a gigantic investment from black rock\nHave withdrawn from this conference before we have to wrap up Karen I Wonder what you think the pushback\nTo all of this might be just as we look to government to push back to business to make it so felt a little bit of both what do you think\nI think the pressure on business is going to grow because the activists have learned that they're more likely to intimidate a CEO than they are too intimidated American president into action\nBut I think the bottom line in the end is that turkey and Saudi Arabia will cooperate if the oil [noise] ah to make this\nSomehow ambiguous and us what what will happen is that Congress will and arms\nOf for use in intelligence cooperation in the war in Yemen\nBut not a\nLot more that will still have the U.S Saudi security relationship it will be cold but it will hold\n... houses senior fellow at Harvard's built for Center for science and international affairs former publisher of the wall Street Journal and author of on Saudi Arabia its people pass religion fault lines and future tearing thanks for talking to us thank you and Sarah Leah Whitson executive director of the middle east and North Africa division of human rights watch thanks Sarah\nThank you this hour was produced by the nice couture to learn more about her and the rest of the staff visit us on line at the one a dot org slash staff\nThis program comes to you from W.

[noise]\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson today on what an eight part three of our special series the state where\nHealth care is top of mind for many lawmakers especially in states that are fighting epidemic levels of opioid that other states are rethinking medicate\nAnd whether low income people who could work should have to as a condition of their coverage and then there's the cost of prescription how do you know you're paying a fair price we'll explore these and other health care issues at stake houses across the country we love to hear from you what's your state government doing with health care and what would you like to\nComment on our Facebook page for sweet on that one day [noise]\nMake up that ten percent that the feds aren't making up a lot of states that it was\nPolitically tenuous for a lot of Republican governors to expand Medicaid under the Affordable CARE Act people thought that they would you were going along with Obamacare at the time when Obamacare was very unpopular especially among Republican circles\nBut a number of states went forward with uh\nEither Medicaid expansion or Medicaid expansion under a different name for example in Indiana the governor there guiding Mike Pence who's now vice president obviously\nA expanded Medicaid or through a program called a hip a Hoosier insurance program um two point oh they got some waivers but essentially it's the same thing as Medicaid expansion so in the states where Republican governors or legislators did not want to expand\nOn it and where ballot initiatives\nMore and more examples of ah of Medicaid expansion going on the ballot and so that's what we see now in Idaho Nebraska and Utah\nJulie let me back after you for just one second so we should be clear on why Medicaid expansion was opposed was this purely you know ... as a Democrat or Republican I don't like your face and so to held Obamacare or was there a policy argument behind why Medicaid expansion was a bad idea in certain states\nThere are conservatives who are going around the country is to these red states Hank don't expand Medicaid don't do anything to make Obamacare succeed so that was part of it a lot of it was political um some of it was and we're seeing this now the idea that\nWell these are able bodied people kids remember they're not disabled they're not age they're not children that are pregnant women the traditional Medicare population\nAnd the idea is well why should we be giving these people health insurance if they could go out and work and Dutch we're starting to see these work requirement um be added and these are being fought mostly in court I don't think there's any on the ballot\nBut the idea of course you know if you look at the statistics the vast majority of people already work that's why they earn a hundred and Fifteen Percent of poverty they just work at really low wage jobs where they don't get health insurance we're hearing\nFrom some of you in states that have decided not to expand medicate jump into Medicaid Joni in Florida left this note in our inbox\nFor almost three decades we've had a Republican led legislature and governor and and the last one has been in place Rick Scott\nHe has refused to accept Pakistanis we've already sent to Washington DC medicate can be paid to about eight hundred thousand needy people in Florida so I Would say we need to get\nSome Democrats in place hit maybe make it happen because there's a lot of people that need care in Florida in it or take it let's turn the tax dollars away\nTony thanks very much for calling in ... of course now running for Senate in the state of Florida read Wilson what's your response to Joe nice comment\nWell that's why we are seeing Democrats across the country talking about health care a ... there is as a matter of fact uh there's a lawsuit right now that challenges a part of the uh the Affordable CARE Act\nThat was filed by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton\nAnd um the attorney general of Wisconsin as well as joined by a number of Republican attorneys general across the country and there are a number of cases in which the Democratic candidates running against those attorneys general are running for US Senate seats are running for ah for governor in ... a bunch of key states including\nPlaces like Michigan or are using that\nA a lawsuit as an example of how Republicans would you know that as they say take away your health care take away protections for those with preexisting conditions\nAre and things like that as we look at at public opinion polls were three weeks out from the mid term elections a health care is the top issue in most states where this is being fought and I think that's a sign that a democratic voters especially our king in on the Affordable CARE Act which you know was an albatross for Democrats in previous elections\nWere speaking to read Wilson national correspondent for the hill Julie Rovner chief Washington correspondent with Kaiser Health news\nAnd Scott Greenberg or executive editor of state line we'd love to hear from you too what issues related to health and health care or hot topics in your state government your state legislature maybe in the elections next month is anyone in your state\nCampaigning on health issues what are they campaigning on how do you feel about that I mean how big a deal or health care issues to you\nAs it relates to who you vote for and how you vote email us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Scott Greenberg let me bring you in Julie reference to the work requirements with Medicaid some states including Arkansas Indiana Virginia\nAgreed to expand Medicaid in exchange for work require much can you detail that a little bit more for what these work requirements actually are\nWell they vary from state to state but ah the ideas Julie noted most people on Medicaid already work but these are attempts to expand the work requirement to more people on and again it varies\nBy state but I think what's interesting about this a couple things first or in some states notably Virginia this was a way to kind of ... to get Medicaid expansion over the finish line the legislature there which is\nClosely divided between Republicans and Democrats this was a way to get Republicans on board and now a with a democratic governor there to finally approved Medicaid expansion and even some\nDemocrats are sort of centrist Democrats were saying well if this is the price that we have to pay to get Medicaid expansion um than it's worth it or however they're all at Arkansas which was one of the first states to approve a work requirements that date where it's actually operate that's right and there are early reports um\nThat uh many many people ... almost five thousand people ended up losing their Medicaid coverage as a result of these requirements and that is focused attention again on on whether uh on on what the requirements should be and whether it's a fair a right to require people to\nUh to to work if they have uh other are facing other challenges\nJulie and I just want to say something about Arkansas what's interesting what we've seen again is that the sort of the first test it's not that these people aren't working they're not losing their Medicaid because they're not working they're losing their medicate because they've been unable to navigate the reporting system which is all on line and there's a lot of people in Arkansas who don't have access to computers um\nYou mean reporting system for declaring that they are working out any time she\nExactly they basically not been able to submit their time she eats a lot of them I've seen a lot of reporting where people have gone around and and some of the people on Medicaid don't even have any idea yet that they're supposed to be doing this um you know they did was we we all as to the Medicaid director and the people who did it\nYou know why are you doing this all on line when so many people don't have Internet access\nAnd the response was well you should be able to be to find a place with Internet access and use it that will be part of helping you get a job um that was sort of their argument with they wanted it to be all on line but because it is all on line a lot of people have not been able to basically prove that they're working\nI Do want to talk about the political prospects for passing Medicaid expansion through the ballot box\nAs we continue our conversation with Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health news Scott Greenberg of state line and read Wilson of the hill still to come here from a state lawmaker who introduced legislation on prescription drugs after he found out from his pharmacist that he could be paying way less for the medication he needed\nI'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a firm W.

in continues today with the discussion of trends on health care law's with read Wilson of the hill Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health news and Scott Greenberger of state line\nGlad to hear from some of you about where health care policy stands for you in terms of your overall politics Suzanne in Maryland wrote on our Facebook page\nAnd I just wanna make sure we're clear because we are a lot of terminology route or fast the formula Larry is the list of prescription Fisher insurance will cover that's correct what about this plan out of California Julie I mean the Jerry Brown is progressive but he's also highly pragmatic\nAnd so I'm guessing he wouldn't have signed this unless he believes it would actually have an impact of lowering drug prices but what do we know in terms of whether these laws actually work in cutting the high cost prescriptions well\nNothing beyond the actual price controls is going to cut the cost of prescription to there is a lot of sort of discussion last week when the president signed these two laws that would basically eliminate God closet so that you can find out if paying retail it'd be cheaper than using your insurance\nUm that doesn't bring down the price of drugs one of the things that's driving up the price of drugs is the advent of these new very fancy biologic drugs that cost billions of dollars to develop\nAnd are you know and and they come out with you know these eye popping price tags you know like a half a million dollars a month and there are a couple\nI mean just really expensive drugs but if I had half a million dollars a month and yes it was for I think that one was the muscular dystrophy drug there there have been some of these very specialized drugs\nBut their cancer drug said that costs you know tens of thousands of dollars per month I mean that the end they may stand life a few months you know some of this is a societal problem that we have to\nYou know think about how much do we want to pay how much is it worth to pay for these drugs on the other hand you know if um\nIf you don't if people people want them that was I had been set it in this very see you're talking about right to try about getting to some of these experimental drugs so if you're dying you clearly wanna try anything you can but who's going to pay for them\nAnd I just want to be clear when we talk about a half million dollars a month that's the sticker price before your insurance pays whatever piece of paper that's correct or I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nScott let me shift to what we believe by far it has generated the most health related legislation which has to do with addressing the opioid crisis there have been more than twenty bills passed this year involving prescription drug monitoring programs talk about what some of those bills too\nSo the idea of the laws differ from state today it's just from state to state some of the laws mandate I'm reporting a debt to prescribe or as a use these prescription or databases which has existed in most states for a long time to make sure that people aren't\nI'm a doctor shopping as the term is called which means go into different doctors in search of a opioid prescriptions also uh these uh databases are designed to prevent people from a a mixing certain drugs that might be harmful to them [noise]\nUm so these are efforts or to to\nTo do something about this opioid crisis which is is killing 'em many many people it's the worst drug crisis that uh the country's ever faced I'm the federal government um uh we should say did recently passed its own a bill to to uh\nTake on the opioid crisis and uh\nThis spill 'em is interesting I'm not just for what's in it but for what is not and it's one thing that's not in it is or what many states have done and other stuff they've taken a curb opioid abuse which is a limit on the supply of opioids that can be prescribed especially for a first time user um\nWe had to supply like the number of days that they would ask like a number of\nDays on it did not include that ah which disappointed some people but uh the the argument on the other side the argument against a including that\nIs that a first of all a doctor's many doctors say this is a complicated or\nA question that should be between a doctor and patient you shouldn't have a blanket rules on how how\nHow what the supply um should be also there's a concern that if you cut people off they you might be pushing them toward a more dangerous so dangerous opioids heroin or ... um and also there are people who are in chronic pain who really do need these drugs and um [noise]\nAh they also have been increasingly vocal about a these are what they consider to be draconian limits on prescribing so it's a very complicated issue the federal bill instead of\nGoing that direction emphasized expansion of of treatment so now allow Medicaid to pay for residential treatment in large facilities and also will allow Medicare to pay for methadone treatment\nThere's also a another set of laws that some states passed this year that would expand access to the ... which is a drug to reverse an overdose some states including Arizona and Rhode Island passed laws that allow for a ... prescription of ... so when opioids are also prescribe is that right\nAh yes ... is a drug that can be administered that will a reverse an overdose Senate ... in addition to the uh\nThe measures you mentioned some states have taken steps to to get in the locks on in the hands of first responders and and also to uh uh to pass so called good Samaritan laws so that if for example of\nA two people are using drugs or perhaps heroin in a legal drug and uh someone overdoses that uh if if the other person the friend uses the locks on that they won't be in trouble with law enforcement is or if they're called in or when I called him\nJust a quick point on this that states that you mentioned Arizona in Rhode Island are are pretty much the most a polar opposite polar opposites that you can get politically and I think that underscores a broader point\nThat the ... the measures that are responding\nTo the opioid overdose are coming from very conservative states and very liberal states are and everybody in between when when I go out to\nState legislative conferences and ask the state legislators what the biggest issue is facing their states every single one of them says the opioid crisis it crosses all kinds of party line this is there's there's no partisanship in any part of this Julie\nAnd I should point out that the bill that just passed Congress a couple of weeks ago was also extremely bipartisan um you know while they were busy in the middle of this huge you know fight about you know a justice cabin uh they were busy putting together this enormous opioid bill that came from Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals at something that basically everybody agrees on\nDixie tweeted we live in
