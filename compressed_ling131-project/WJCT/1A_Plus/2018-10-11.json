a chance of rain and thunderstorms low around eighty one Thursday it's going to start off cloudy but it should end mostly sunny and when they look for hype Ninety One\nBlack lives matter movement has no central leadership but it does have some big names like ... and how does he see his place in the fight for justice\nFrom W AMU and NPR in Washington this is one egg [noise]\nHey there I'm Joshua Johnson today on one age ... his advocacy goes beyond issues of police brutality and his work goes further than organizing grassroots protest there is no lack of issues to keep him busy but now he's reflecting on his time and activism\nEspecially in the four years since the protests in Ferguson, Missouri [noise] how did he face the difficulties of being a full time organizer\nAnd what's in his future will get to know during the cussing and explore\nAbortion clinic in Harlem Missouri I didn't even know there were seven states with only one abortion clinic right so they're all these things that we try and focus on that people just don't they don't make the news but they are incredibly important and that's what gives me joy right now\nLet's talk a little bit about some of the things that have been going on lately you came to the nation's attention as a result of these protests in Ferguson, Missouri as we mentioned\nProtests has come up a lot in the last few years as a result of the current administration the president has opined on the campaign trail and asked president or some of his views on how protesters should be treated early last month the president told reporters in his words quote I think it's embarrassing for the country to allow protesters\nIn the old days we used to just throw them out today they just keep screaming unquote that was in response to dissenters at the Senate hearings for Supreme Court nominee now justice Brett Kavanaugh now protest is protected by the first amendment so we can't just\nThrow protestors out but what do you make of kind of the public conversation around protests today\nWe see that when it's people of color in the street that everybody thinks protesting\nOr seeing in the world a Trump didn't have the same comments when they when the the white supremacists in Charlottesville right that in Charlottesville where so wild about Charlottesville beside the T he tortures and besides the the guy\nWas how I don't know if you saw the footage of the the white supremacist literally pushing the police like as a group pushing the police it's like that I couldn't even imagine you know I've been in many places and many streets in in none of them can I imagine black protesters physically pushing that police in groups and then not ending and bloodshed like I just don't even know what that looks like so\nTo what we see here is like the the not so friendly coded language about like what happens when people of color push back and say that\nThis isn't working um you know that sort of the thing about the right is it the right you just re packaging old messages with a new language and we've seen you know laws for a long time that we're like people can assemble people call it can't be in any groups like that he just like repack any that\nAre for this time that like when it's white people doing it he hasn't said the same thing\nSo that I guess gets to some of the critique about what folks on the weeks a demonstration in Ferguson where some describe it as unrest or or even riots that did you feel like there's a more of a racial component there than some of the critics made themselves ...\nYou know people are always asking me if I'm over exaggerating the the impact of Twitter and it's a Twitter literally saved our lives that like you have to remember that in twenty four teen parents go up there was nothing for glide Instagram live like none of that the only live streaming with like you stream and that was like people to pay to use it so\nIt sounds like Twitter was like the mechanism if you remember that the the first city that you saw ... do you remember the first city that you cite aerial footage of the protest at\nThe first city um that you saw arrow footage I I don't remember the first city you know I remember seeing it and being stunned by it but I don't remember the first city\nIt was Baltimore you didn't see any you you've never seen any arrow footage of the protests in St Louis because they declared a no fly zone immediately so I can make a killing the night and they declare no five on the on the twelve so\nLike there was no way for you to see what's happening if it wasn't people who are on the ground and I think one of the things that like work to benefit is that the media came in and you're right the language is like the rioters I you know black people are being dramatic industry and like that\nAnd then the police are like indiscriminately wild like I remember when Don Lemon got tear gas and it was one of those moments where like he was one of those people in the news that of a quid vacating about the police and he's got to be I think he's like no they the protests are right where like yes we knew we were right right or like\nYou brought up the five second rule that people don't people don't remember that it was illegal to stay in film August September October twenty four team that if we still\nFor more than five seconds we were arrested like that's why we marched all day not because we're not marching was like the most effective tactic like we had to march and like people forget those things and I never want to lose sight of how fragile freedom is and that was one of the big takeaways from being in the street for the initial wave of the protest in St Louis\nWe're speaking to dream a caisson his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope we got a number of voice mails from some of our listeners about you and your work Andrew in Atlanta left this in our inbox\nEd or a huge fan I'm just wanted to say how do you respond to criticism from your opponents when they say just outlandish ridiculous things like black lives matter as a terrorist organization\nI'm it's just as bad as the Ku Klux Klan and it's just as bad as neo Nazis and a few guys his fault for what happened at the Charlottesville protests like how do you guys respond to that\nAndrew thanks very much for contacting us through our apple won a vox pop to write what would you say the Andrew\n... so we know that that is an attempt to distract of so when we when we think about like why do we focus on black people the first thing that we can focus on the issue around police volunteer the violence and that doesn't mean that we don't care about the other issue so I can go to a breast cancer rally in that doesn't mean that I don't care about colon cancer just means that I'm focusing on this specific issue\nIn this way why focus on black people live at a we know that the disparities in the outcomes are just so bad for people of color that if we fix it for black people were actually automatically fix it for everybody else like that makes sense\nI think that the other points to like you know where the cause of the violence and things like that it's like you know when I was on the street the only violence I thought it was about to the police and like we wouldn't have been there the police and killed anybody and remember that like the problem is a problem all across the country you think about California one in eleven gun homicides and California is actually committed by police officer that's like\nThat's wild you know like this is a big issue and there are structural reasons that the police never get held accountable if you think about places like California where there's a law that says that\nLiterally any investigation of an office in the last more than a year can never resolve discipline regardless of the outcome in Cleveland they destroy a police officer disciplinary records every two years in Maryland my home town there's a lot and said that\nAh you can follow ... complaining it's an officer for everything except brutality so when we hear these sort of deflecting like you know why are you guys doing this you got to bring the pain I the way I respond to he's always like we pay it back to what the facts aren't the second thing I think very quickly if\nI had no longer even really preachy about this stuff I Want to have other people I explained to me so you know when people tell me that social welfare programs are bad and like why are we just given people things in fact I asked them\nLike what does a four year old has to do to earn dinner\nYou know like what is a seven year old have to do to be worthy of shelter like you tell me how they earn dinner great like\nI Want to hear them explain that to me like people say Mike Brown didn't have his hands up it's like ... dead today for supposedly Jay walking like you is that a consequence of with the police you know I'm going to a lot of panels that the police and they'll say to me during there's a lot of crime crimes you know crime is bad or\nAre you saying the police you never kill somebody and I said and I'm like tell me when the police to kill your child like your kids going to make a mistake your kids going to do something then negatively impacts somebody else like what's the mistake that you be okay with the officer putting a bullet through your child\nShe was like I don't know I'm like well you know I don't know right so a part of my work as a share the cognitive\nBurden much more to discuss as we continue our conversation was during the cats than I Do want to talk to you more of course about the black lives matter movement particularly your role which in it I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a firm W.

of catching the host of the podcast pod save the ...\nOh and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope one by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nThat people have him on it too and again the outcomes with police fallen suggests the stock that this there is something there\nWill lead you wonder though about that second test club comments about disregarding the entire police force that kind of echoes a short voice mail that we received here's what Holly from Kentucky left in our inbox\nUnderstand why black lives matter like you were ...\nHow does that help public safety\nHolly thanks for getting in touch with ... what do you make of that to raise this kind of\nHash tag not all police arguments the question becomes what you want the police to do well actually I'm Sorry I Know I hate to cut you short read first of all I just want to fact check Holly's ... of ... voice mail does black lives matter actually want fewer police officers or remember that\nThe movement is expensive so there's some people on the move mountains certainly um\nWho sort of think that that level of policing that we have is okay a lot of people push for less\nI think the question is like you know what what do you think police officers do and if if you think that police officers like solving the most heinous crimes and think that actually isn't happening if you think that like they should be responding to cats and trees and like traffic incident that's actually happening more often than not\nTo the question becomes like where do we put our energy if we want community is actually be safe and again like most of the crimes that we see in the neighborhood that we see it in his crimes of addiction and crimes of poverty and like we should actually attack\nPoverty an addiction really aggressively so that we actually don't need a response to conflict because we can actually make sure that there's less conflict to when you hear people talk about like just more police have like a blanket it's like sort of what do you want the police to do that these are the same people who are like police officers aren't counselor and God's counting the social workers it's like\nWhat you think that the solution requires guidance counselors and social workers we should probably invest in those romantic that actually makes sense to me is that if anything I Want more police on Wall street right like I Want more police like with white collar crimes like that's what I Want and if we have to invest your money policing like I'm trying to figure out the people that like\nBroke the stock market in and like the fraud and all the people out of their homes with mortgages like those are things that I don't understand but like we can do something about addiction in poverty\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nWhere we are coming up on ten years since Bernie Madoff got arrested for his gigantic Ponzi scheme so there may be something to that in like the only person or what we think about all the people that didn't get arrested you know didn't get arrested or got arrested and then got out and have kind of just gone on with their lives and in one way or another in the book you write\nThat quote like all institutions policing wants to convince you that at his permanent\nThe only way forward and is in its best form now unquote clearly you don't believe\nThat that's true there are some parts of the country that are you know definitely grappling with the future of policing\nThere was the liquid McDonald's case in Chicago where a white Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of second degree murder for shooting and killing him a case we spoke about on the show recently\nIf what what'd you say to people who are generally supporters of law enforcement who feel that all officers shouldn't be painted with a broad brush\nBut who might be open to some kind of reform is there something some low hanging fruit some common ground that people across the spectrum on this issue might be able to agree on tackling first\nYeah do you think about in when you think about in Austin we work with the often organizes the Austin city council unanimously voted against the last version of the police union contract and one of the ways that they got that to happen in like in Austin the contract said that an officer who suspended for one two or three days\nAt the suspension automatically get three code it as a written repairman reprimand\nAnd like that just doesn't make sense ... like you can love the police and still be like that's just not fair rate and Cleveland and Chicago where their closet and say that we destroy a police officer discipline records you can love the police and that's just not fair right like to some of this is some people's interest is not like it's just not fair that you would lose your mind if like\nIf I told you that at the school system we just delete it every bad thing that the teacher did the teachers can slap kid and like there's just no consequence you'd be like that is wild\nBut when the police do people like oh ... that's ... that sort of crazy and again like this isn't a ... a you know part of it too is pushing back on the premise and it's like all police officers are bad people it's like I don't know our police officers people this is a statement about the institutions do you\nThink about school public school that's like when you look at a school where like nobody's learning it's not that you think that like every teacher in America is a bad teacher you're like what's going on like what is going on in the school districts or schools were like nobody is it a lack of investment is it just like a lack of outcomes but like\nNobody is saying that the questions that are worthy question it's weird that like or it's odd that like with policing the moment that you say like it's not working people like oh my God you must hate everybody it's like no I'm just saying it it just isn't working like that sort of just a true thing\nUm [noise] so it's interesting where the people who set of defend that police getting me immediately defensive when you are literally just asking for a modicum of accountability Ninety seven percent of the\nOfficers who are involved in a\nAny killings like aren't even charge Ninety nine aren't convicted and like you saw the ... you heard about the bathroom gene being killed or where the Austin just walked in to his house like that\nI don't that just doesn't seem right to be raining I don't think very controversial yeah it just doesn't seem controversial that sense of humor I you've seen the videos like I've seen the videos and\nAnd like I won't accept that that's just collateral damage of what it means to be safe\nWhile I Know we we have to pause and just a moment where might step one be in terms of reform that people across the spectrum on this might be able to agree on before we have to break\nI think it's like with the police you encounter coming with the laws that like it is it is basic about fairness and we started to sing and check the police that works that you can see in your city that clauses that they just aren't fair\nSo just being more active in terms of what the basic rules are the governed policing\nYeah like it's actually really hard to find out the ... the rules that allow police officers to shoot and kill people in the cities it's like so there's some places where like officers don't have to use any escalation did or the escalation like to kill people they learn early in the first interaction they can shoot you that's why if that doesn't make sense you know you can love the police and stuff like that and\nWe have been spending a fair amount of time talking about the political will try to talk a little more personal with activists and offered to re

called on the other side of freedom the case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book it's like a page and a half\nWhere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nTrumping crazy he was crazy before he became president and that alone wasn't a motivator he's crazy now and like that actually is still isn't necessarily a motivator for people for some people with a de motivator because they feel like he's so wow that nothing can change to like she's voting against him is not I think that's like the wrong message\nThe second is like this or that sort of battle with Obama's at just a telling people if they really care about the country that they'll vote if also the bad message at like there's a\nGeneration of young people who like won't be shamed into participating I bought in my entire life I got\nArrested tia grass tear gas dragged on a police department by my ankles like boating wasn't it wasn't the end all be all that changed everything we think about voting as one of the important tools and the tool kit and it's one of the tools and I think that that's how we start talking about it the second is that we should give people things to have a fourth year in Florida you both for ah getting\nTheir voting rights back for ex felons if you're in Louisiana you should vote for changing the jury loss of the ... jurors have to vote to convict somebody\nOf a felony right like that should be our language like you are voting for and America when we think about who's going to be trumping twenty twenty and won't be somebody who's running against Trump it'll be somebody who's running for vision of American it's bigger than him that if you just run against him you're only as big as he is and we we need to have somebody bigger than that\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day [noise]\nSpeaking of tactics for the future maybe we should talk about that as we wrap up our conversation the next to last chapter in the book the penultimate chapter is called on organizing\nAnd you argue that the tactics and strategy is to serve activists in the past don't necessarily help now quote the tactics that were effective in bringing about change in the sixties seventies and eighties are well known to all especially those who oppose them unquote\nGive me an example of one of the newer tactics that serve activists today that you think has some real viability that people should be\nPaying attention to is I think that like this is a macro comment one is that like we just have access to the Internet and uh and so she meet in a way that we didn't before so they are the style of active and they said that the only way to be a part\nOf a of any thing Rio I'd like to be a member to join a collective to do that and like what was so beautiful about the protests about the movement certainly about St Louis they you didn't need any of that ad like you just needed to come into work and that there's like a whole organizing tradition that just invalidate that that like\nIt says that if you don't participate in like an established group and honored member like\nThat that's the only way collective action can happen in like that I think that's actually just a really dangerous way to think about organizing the second is that not that the tactics have failed but that like the other side actually just like understand some better so there was a there was a time when like being in a union union organizing with like the best possible organizing it was like the most organized you couldn't go get singing\nOr unions are remain really important they are political salient is just different now not because they are weaker but because people are found other ways to organize\nSo we should like support unions and you're in organizing we should also validate those moms would just like set up a a organizing banging their their community like all of these are real and like they're still people who say like if you don't do it if you're not trained in this tradition like you're not a real and like that sort of weird I remember being in the street in St Louis and like\nThere was this narrative literally that like people came down and I'm like\nStarted a movement and found that things and like organize all that sort of Savage protest that was that's like still have the narrative is and like what actually happened it was like we were just like we don't know we're doing we know we're right though and we'll figure it out and a lot of people that just had to do a lot to figure it out even I write it in the book about the guy who um\n[noise] the first person ever use the hash tag black lives matter like he's been just a race from the narrative and he did it you know a year before other people even say they started saying and race\nHow do we just talk about the whole space uh and like let it grow like let other people that come in and see what's going on in the last thing on the very quickly that there are a lot of organizers\nWho sort of do that if you don't do it with me are like me you're not a real organizer and that's also a really dangerous and we have to like ... and I said this is somebody who's been a lot of places I think I've done go work I also know that like I've gotten messages from like sixteen year old\nTo have had no political training who had incredible ideas and I'm not arrogant enough to believe that the way I Do it is the

didn't know how to respond effectively I told him\nThat it wasn't his place as a privileged white male to say if black people should or should not get over slavery uh but I Would be curious what Mr my cats and would recommend as a more thoughtful effective response to a comment such as this thank you\nThank you Molly for asking the question dream or a super long time but I Wonder what you would say

A. M. U. and NPR this is one egg [noise]\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson today on what a we begin with the Netflix animated comedy bow jak horsemen\nThe series follows a horse human hybrids is rebuilding his life and it deals with real life issues in unique ways ... creator Rafael Bob ... than we shift gears to Saturday Night live we see the actors\nBut they see someone who can make or break their performance if we'll get to know SNL cue cards guy while we ... our conversations today are on tape\nBut we love to hear from you comment on our Facebook page or tweet us at one egg [noise]\nAnd and it's really for me a show about sadness and and melancholy and isolation um ... which I guess there are other cartoons like that um but it's it's not just about\nHaving fun and being silly although it is also very fun and silly you really kind of cornered me I'm I'm not quite a scribe is I think I'd be better about it by now but but the the ... the part\nIt's a it's a horse man uh in the nineties he was a on a TV show called horsing around about a horse racing three human kids are now he's a washed up actor he lives in the Hollywood Hills and he complains about everything that's that's where he is are we first find him and\nOver the course of the last five seasons are a lot of other things have happened\nHe was on the show back in the nineties it was essentially I Would say like a full house type of ... ...\nYou know it has its feral [laughter] maybe I Love horses around I you know I think some people\nWatch Jack ... and they go yeah this is okay but I really much rather watch horse and around the U.S up to each their own well Bo jak\nThough he had fame and success plenty of money a nice house he is a deeply unhappy person in Hollywood he has a good sense of humor he has fun sometimes ... misery and depression as you said isolation and loneliness are never too far away for him\n... yeah that's right [laughter]\nIt's a comedy [laughter] yeah he he's he's he's a he's a sad guy and you know we I pride myself and the fact we take that sat in this very seriously and we explore in some ways the root cause of it and also the effect that it has\nOn others um I I I think this is a show about loneliness\nUm and I think that is why it appeals to so many people because there aren't a ton of people who are on successful sitcoms in the eighties and nineties but there are a lot of people who feel lonely sometimes and I think those people to see something of themselves into jak\nNot only ... the man but he is troubling personality is set in Hollywood\nThat seems like the worst possible place for someone like him he's got damage self esteem he selfish she's got a substance abuse problem that's the that's the tip of the iceberg really for Beau jak and he lives in inhabits a world with all the wrong enabling forces it seems to me\nA bit really push against him I Know I'm over analyzing bow jak but it also is a send up about Hollywood\nYeah and I I think that's exactly\nRight but in many ways this town in this industry\nIs the worst place to be if you're someone who needs limits and help\nA because this is a town that's that's built up to help you not get help 'em and and to enable you and allow you your worst vices um\nYou know I I think a a a ... a big fear of mine is someone who is a found some success\nIn this industry and and you know may continue to find more is that eventually I Will get to a place where people stop telling me I'm wrong and then I won't make some very big mistakes and I'm I'm lucky right now that I surround myself with people who are not afraid\nTo tell me what I'm screwing up and what I Need to apologize and when I Need to uh check myself and ask for help but I think it's very easy\nIn this town to to find the people who won't do that and uh then I think you're in real trouble\nWell David pacman writes about your show he says the bow jak horsemen is the only animated show that made me belly laugh Saab and sit in shocked silence all in the course at a single episode or is that what you're going for hitting all these different notes in in in in a single go\nUm yes [laughter]\nYou know we're very ambitious and you know I think one of things I enjoy the show and keep it fresh for me that it's a lot of different things and we I think we have a lot of different\nAudiences who enjoy the show for different reasons right so there are people who say this is the funniest show I've ever seen and it makes me cry and it makes me think and made me call my mom\nUm and then they're also sections that like there are people who say you know I don't find the show very funny at all but it it it moves me and I care about the characters and there are also people who say I think the show's hilarious and I don't care about the characters at all but I Love the jokes\nAnd I think this is a show for all of those people and depending on what you go into it looking for you're going to get something different out of it and that's really fun for me and that makes\nEvery day of work fun because I come and go okay what kind of showed her I Want to make today and that can change yeah sometimes within one episode or sometimes even within one scene or even within one line of dialogue you could start heartbreaking and end all areas or start with some goofy wordplay and end with a real bummer\nAnd I wanted to ask you exactly\nAbout that dynamic on the show because on one level you've got a lot of crafty sometimes corny word play a lot of them on a lot of\nLot of slapstick lot of anti jokes that could be on any sort of children's cartoon that has to be fun for adults as well right overlaid on a lot of deep satire and an overlay that on some of the deepest at times most troubling emotional stuff\nThat I've seen on television I mean slapstick and pat falls and ... and I've had to look away from both ... once or twice\nWell it's it's funny because I sometimes people tell me uh when they meet me at like a bar mitzvah or something oh my you know my son loves that show\nAnd I really worry I oh do you have you seen it go no but my son loves it and you know whose whose twelve years old um and it's a very adult show and\nYou know not because of the the the drug humor the sex humor which of course there is plenty of Adam swearing as well but because I I I think it it goes to some very a deep dark adults places and I use that word adults to mean\nA complicated and and and nuanced and and troubling um and so it's definitely not a show for kids but I think you know one thing we found when we're making the first season is we wanted it to be silly and we wanted to also be serious and the question was can we do both\nAnd one thing we found is that yes we can and and rather than um\nYou know water itself down it actually helps the show to to have both of these polls and that ... to me I think it creates kind of a um\nA a savory and sweet or solve the ... all kinds of sensation where it is both very are real and sincere and melancholy um but also very bright and silly and cartooning\nAnd that I I think the farther you go in one direction almost counter intuitively the further that allows you to to go and the other direction and and I don't think we found a limit yet for how silly we can go or how dark and introspective we can go I think our our latest season might be both are so we just got to get the same time what\nWe're going to talk a lot more about some of the amazing voice performances on ... and we'll talk a little bit about season five I'm speaking with ...

Blacksburg he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen it just released its entire season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season a rough it let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it [laughter] getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a ... actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nWas and he said there is as princess Carolyn David Sedaris her brother as her mother cutie cutie cupcake they can buy their way\nAnd Amy and David are from North Carolina which you know we I've read David sitters his books and and I think that Amy and her brother David our our channeling something that's that's very real to them or\nPerhaps you know it's funny listening to that conversation because I think it really illustrates we're talking about before is that\nThat is actually a very serious conversation with your mother and her daughter um and it's it's it's fraught with drama but then at the same time you know you're watching it you you can't escape the fact that these are both pink cats called the princess Carolyn cutie cutie cupcake\nUh and and there's it sprinkled with jokes like the UCLA you will not CLA this word play in the middle of his very a serious conversation\nUm that was a real joy to get David said there is to be a guest or you know we Ask Amy do you think he would be interested we have this part for him and she said I think that sounds like a lot of fun\nAnd so he he called in and he was very self conscious about it and he's like you know\nUh I'm not really an actor but I I you know I I Want to do this for a me but if I'm terrible you know you can replace me and you don't have to feel bad about it\nAnd then he said the first line I thought oh my God that for instance ... mother he's a total natural obviously he's a performer I mean he reads his own stuff all the time so I don't know why what he had to be nervous about but I think he gives an incredible performance\nAnd I feel like you can really hear\nThe family between them it feels like there are a family which of course they are\nI'm Todd's where like you're listening to one a\nAn episode for the season is called Bo jak the feminist or gets real in Hollywood because Bowe jak gets credit for speaking out against Vance Wagner he's a bad Hollywood Man kind of character maybe sort of like a like a Mel Gibson type for somebody\nLike sure I Know Gibson type you can say here's a will our net as Beau jak talking to the host of the squat who are all birds obviously during that absurd\nIt is really incredible you're taking a stand against your own ... no I'm not taking any standing that guy killed his wife Holly well it's like no that's\nOK well obviously it's not good joke is why I wasn't trying to make some bold statement it or anything it's just that joke in your wife is bad\n[noise] okay\nCan I just tell you how amazing it is to hear man say that well below about someone needed to take a stand\n[noise] crazy I mean is it just all\nVote jak talking but how about we don't show and he will\n[noise] right\n[laughter] ... [laughter]\nI just what I watched this episode I laughed and I turned\nAway it made me uncomfortable as could be because of this conversation goes horribly wrong even though he's saying all the right things I guess don't\nChoke yeah well I mean I I agree that we should not joke women right that certainly is nothing to laugh about 'em but I mean to me I think the comedy of this episode and bow Jack's character in this episode a comes from the real place that I've experienced you know from being a male feminist\nYou know how often I feel like I and other men get credit for the bare minimum you know are for you know tweeting out something\nThat uh women have been shouting about for the last fifty years or all of a sudden like I Am a a progressive feminist hero um and I think that's really sad\nUh but like many things on our show it is sad but also darkly funny or we really wanted to explore that and and kind of point out that\n... even people who have the best of intentions or can can sometimes fall into the trap of patting themselves on the back for for doing the bare minimum and then also people sometimes you don't have the best of intentions can also passed themselves on the\nBack just doing a bit of signaling instead of ...\nAnd I and I think it is important for for for men and and people with privilege to speak out on behalf of those who do not have those privileges or but I think it's it's a delicate thing and it and it requires sensitivity of how how to do it in a helpful way and not and self serving\nWay ... ... is the kind of guy who would love to just signal a little bit and get out of it in a self serving way yes elite he'll take\nHe'll take the credit without doing the work at ... jak style\nAnd then just get people to leave him alone afterward yeah ... you know one thing I've I've noticed about Bo jak and it's not hard to notice is that he just he manages to repeat his same mistakes over and over again and and I don't like to think that he hasn't grown\nAt all in a positive way over five students they had learned anything sometimes I get a little bit\nSometimes we'll get a little bit annoyed with him that he just hasn't learned I mean has he has grown up at all\nI you know I think he has I think progress has never a straight line um I like to think that he's taking you know two steps forward one step back maybe sometimes three steps back but I Would like to think that he's you know crawling and and and grasping and the right direction and I I think it is\nTo be determined where he will end up but I you know like you get frustrated with them sometimes and I I I Hope\nFor for better or and I think you know the story will be the story and and every day we come in and we think about All right well what's what's gonna happen next and I think we'll see where it goes\nPrincess Carolyn has is striving to have a more meaningful life outside of just money and work\nUh yeah I think we'll see what I can as well um you know I one of the the fun things about having a show that's been on five seasons now is you know you start with with the bow jak horsemen a story and then you know at first of all these other characters there to kind of help and tell his story but then gradually we flush them out too and so now I think we have\nFive really interesting new wants to main characters that that all carry\nTheir own stories have their own wants and desires dreams and fears and so it's been really fun to flush those out and and and explore the the nooks and crannies of of their narratives it's a world of\nAnimals and people in ponds and slap stick and deep deep dark sometimes\nSometimes off putting themes but he is one of the best shows on the air is Beau jak horsemen like I said I'm a fan and I'm just not going to hide it ... because it's a pleasure for me to talk to you so thanks for being with us thank you so much this is a blast\nRafael Bob Blacksburg is the creator and show runner of Bo jak horsemen season five is streaming on Netflix coming up a unique look behind the scenes of Saturday Night live the clubs [noise]\n\nI'm Margaret woman in the world news around with a story about Democrats in Arizona they're looking for a win in November and they're counting on support from Latino voters but many Arizona Latinos are conservative for example some of them want a border wall\nThey don't respond in sort of that nature fashion that if you refer secure borders that means you don't like brown people\nWhy stereotypes don't begin to explain Arizona politics is on the world this afternoon at three\nOn eighty nine nine W.
