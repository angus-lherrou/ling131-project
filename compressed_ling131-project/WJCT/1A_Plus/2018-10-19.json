either live here now or have lived here in the past and have close ties to the city um and then we had a narrow down because they need to have close ties with the district\nAnd we want it to represent

define but more and more people are trying to give it an identity and this is I guess one way of doing that\nExtremely difficult and it's probably why isn't anthology of stories rather than a book

I mean it's it's a massive issue I mean here this could be a close is a race in recent history it's a dog by these allegations of voters being cut from the ... um mostly talk about keeping more than fifty thousand mostly black residents off the rolls [noise]\nYou know the the camp says that he can be impartial and he points to other um other secretaries of state who have overseen um elections but\nYou know the sources that we have spoken to and we've covered this um say that look this is just a matter of common sense it is so close it is so important that he should be considered risky using himself\nI'm from a overseeing this such a critical election there's too much at stake um but he seems to be fighting fighting that um and we'll see what happens I I this this is an issue that we will continue to see for the next several waves\nAnd just to be clear of Stacey Abrams will become America's first black female governor not just Georgia's first if she wins Alexander I know we have to pause momentarily but this race\nSeems to be pretty close what what happens if this comes down to a few hundred votes then you've got the official who oversees elections trying to I presumed keep some reasonable distance in determining whether he wins the election he is in\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the legal fight that could go on for weeks if we're at the point where it's close enough that we're seeing a recount and I was speaking with and I'm sort of election protection officials like yesterday who said that Georgia is their top priority\nThey're training you know hundreds of lawyers to be on the ground in that state watching the polls making sure that nothing happens on on sort of election day\nAnd then beyond they are preparing for a protracted fight over that race because you know it's expected to come down to a couple of hundred that\nMuch more to discuss as we continue the friday news roundup with Frank or don't is a McClatchy Alexandra Jaffe of vice news tonight on HBO and Josh Rogers of New Hampshire public radio also we want to talk about the Senate race in Texas ... between Democrat Beto O'Rourke and Republican Ted Cruz will get some more stories\nFrom the midterms and also talk about above loved American retailer facing a tougher natural future and saying goodbye to a Microsoft cofounder I'm Joshua Johnson glad to be with you from Concord New Hampshire you're listening to one a firm W.

public radio senior political correspondent\nJosh Rogers Franco or don't yes White House correspondent for McClatchy and Alexandra Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO we'd love to hear from you about this week's big story so comments on our\nOr I mean I think that there's always going to be I'm a bit to be desired I'm certainly this administration has come under fire\nFor its response is a two hurricanes particularly a recent hurricanes and uh that hit Puerto Rico and South Florida you know they certainly\nAre made a big effort to change that and to come and meet a you know meet better expectations I'm In the most previous hurricane I think that attention uh they were able to take some of that attention away\nBut you know also just in the nature of our news cycle a today there was so much there's so much news happening every day or that there's some new news story that's happening that's kind of taking some of that attention away so I'm not sure the national attention\nIs at high I'm On the FEMA recovery effort is before um but certainly there's no question that that that more\nThey're more support would be light would be enjoyed I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nShift gears to a different kind of storm Twitter storm from the president this week on immigration on Wednesday the president exhorted Republicans to make immigration a key issue for the mid term elections Josh Rogers I'm interested in your take on New Hampshire but just New Hampshire but\nParticularly New Hampshire and how big a deal immigration is in the midterms are people talking about it is it one issue among many where does it stand I\nThink is one issue among I mean it is one that um has been ... for Republicans\nAre in this state I can think back to you know when John McCain campaigned up here and talk about immigration reform and you know most people leave the room of you know Donald Trump certainly a road that we're very far from the you know close to the Canadian border of quite far from Mexico\nA but it is something the Republicans\nAre talking about one thing that surprised me though is that the limited degree to which congressional candidates Republicans have been talking about it if a voter brings it up they will say there's generally supportive of the president and they believe you know we need to have all on the border and and pretty much leave it there I'm\nYou know it's hard to know how much Donald Trump can envision\nOf running for election and any other mode and the one he's chosen and you know we're ... we'll see where that ends up as as far as voters go\nYou know conservative voters will tell you they're concerned about it but it is not foremost in people's minds here\nAlexandra I Wonder what your senses of whether or not immigration is the kind of issue\nThat fires up you know Republicans to kind of mitigate what some people are calling a democratic blue wave whether it fuel fuels democratic support whether it has a little bit of a benefit for both I mean who who gets the most political bang for the buck by focusing on immigration\nI spoke with a couple of Republican strategists working on house and Senate races this week who said that at this point it's more of an advantage for Republicans because Democrats have overstepped in talking about abolish ice\nAnd to the extent to which you know President Trump and other Republicans can make that the brand of the Democratic party which we've been hearing that debate in within the sort of twenty twenty field and they believe that they can turn immigration into an advantage for Republicans and and just sort of fire up the Republican base again\nSo at this point it seems like they think that it's a win and what we've seen in many polls that Hispanic voters generally or\nI'm not as enthusiastic about the midterms and maybe not as excited to turn out for Democrats as Democrats would expect I don't know that there's any concern necessarily for any risk rather for ... for Republicans to start talking about this issue\nJosh Rogers the president tweeted again with regards to immigration yesterday he threatened to use the military in an effort to stem the tide of immigration into the U.S specifically he was referring to a caravan of about two thousand migrants that are headed to the U.S Mexico border pretty much walking to the U.S Mexico border\nCan you tell us a little bit more about that what nations that he threatened why and and whether that is even within the purview of the military\nUm well I'm Sorry I'm Sorry with Frank I'm Sorry what is going to your friend would you would you tell us a little more about that\nYeah absolutely so this is a caravan of thousands or this has been done before it's actually been done over the over over the years I base\nComes out of Honduras um but the country is the most of these uh migrants who are involved are come from Honduras Guatemala Guatemala and El Salvador may come to the ... they they make the trip to the United states their purpose\nIs to bring attention to the plight of migrants are but also to come to the United states and to seek um seek relief some some apply for asylum there's no question some will try to get into the country illegally\nOthers will kind of shrink a drop off on the way trying to get opportunities\nUm in Mexico for example\nIs a is a massive issue it as a massive issue or for the president right now he is completely jumped on this issue trying to you know stir up a motion stroke concerned this is obviously a two thousand sixteen issue or as well he ... he you know he used\nA immigration as one of his signature issues if not the signature issue\nUm to take him to office and this caravan\nUh is is being used in that sense of saying look these tweets that he did yesterday\nBlaming Democrats are blaming open borders or to the Democrats that I spoke to they see this is largely a political move on to try to steer 'em responsibility away from his own policies because of some of the policies that you got that was talked about just a minute ago have not been successful and\nCamping down or clamping down on some of the migration take family my ... family separation policy that really blew up in his face um you know trying to cut down on the border and the reality is we're seeing a we're back to kind of record number of migration coming to the\nBorder Alexandra before we have to pause to the defense secretary did authorize deploying four thousand National Guard troops along the border I I Wonder what we make about whether it was kind of a deployment with the hopes that the governor has refused to deploy these troops I mean what what was behind that\nI mean as Franco noted it's a bit of a political play um it's sort of accept Trump's promise with um at least an attempted action but the question is will that do anything will that change anything and as Frank mentioned\nEven though the Trump Administration has implemented stronger immigration policy is the border crossings are still coming and folks are still attempting to enter the country so at the end of the day it it seems like more of sort of a a PR move for a move to a back up the president rather than anything that will have an effect\nMore to discuss as we continue the friday news roundup was Alexander Jaffe Franco or don't is and

infamously hit this point among foreign policy circles are said to the press as he was leaving Saudi Arabia or that they didn't discuss facts and uh the that is absolutely\nWhy did you go to Saudi Arabia many you're asking if not to get facts about this case I Will say that um the what is an interesting bind right now considering the fact that decades of strategic policy in the middle east has been built around the idea that Saudi Arabia is an ally though they may have their human rights issues that something that we have to overlook\nIn order to gain access to oil to gain access to the regional strength that they have in their leadership is something that Trump has been arguing in trying to push back against the desire to actually do anything about this oppose it murder\nAnd um it it's something that I feel like the Trump Administration is having more of a struggle with than other administrations what even though\nThey will grapple with it too but given how ... the president is still with his personal businesses\nAre of which are the Saudis have dumped quite a bit of money in recent years a into his hotels and into his properties there this linking of these two things makes it hard to unravel what is and the strategic interest of the United states to say or not say about this case in what is in the president's personal interest\nWe should note have said earlier this week the president tweeted quote for the record I have no financial interest in Saudi Arabia in parentheses or Russia for that matter any suggestion that I have is just more fake news all caps parentheses of which there is plenty\nUnquote so hey that's not true [noise] I Would say that's not true uh in recent years since he became president the Saudis have spent a lot of money at his Washington DC property the Trump Hotel there\nHe they have bought a hotel they about apartments in his buildings in Trump Tower I Believe in New York City they bought an entire floor previously or he assault a yacht to\nA Saudi prince he has had financial ties in the past at least and while he might not be making new business deals with the Saudis the fact that he is still gaining profit from their staying in his a D.C hotel and other properties that is a financial links loophole\nThere Joshua was saying in Saudi Arabia he may not have as a write in Saudi Arabia but he has plenty of business deals with Saudi Arabians well\nAnd those business connections might turn out to be something of an Achilles' heel for the Saudis depending on how they deal with this James I mean there is more pressure mounting on Saudi Arabia to resolve this particularly\nOn this worldwide business summit that's scheduled for next week in Riyadh a number of companies have dropped out including Google and Hoover and GPA Morgan Chase of Ford's chairman said he's not going a number of media companies like the New York times on CNN yesterday the treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced he would not be going\nI Wonder if this is kind of where the major pressure lands on Saudi Arabia especially\nBecause the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been trying very hard to make Saudi Arabia look much more business friendly to the world\nYou know I think that that whole campaign is at a standstill now and I and and I have a ... a lot of questions or whether it's even a sustainable going forward because\nYou know even before this there was a lot of concern that the the NBS was a hothead he's very reckless very young yes he is a reformer but he's also become much more autocratic than his predecessors\nHe started this huge fight with Qatar\nHe is running this is really reckless a war in Yemen where\nA seems not to have a ... a very strong sensitivity to civilian casualties started this big fight with Canada 'cause he felt they had a disc Tim uh this is ... ... ... ... this is the most egregious of a number of steps that suggested this guy is going to be a very very a reckless ally to have\nA which creates a huge problem with the Trump Administration because it's closest Saudi Arabia has been as an ally in the past Jared Kushner has created a particular close relationship with um NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nI'm part of the chairs are suppose peace deal he was critical to that\nThey are critical they just gave a hundred million dollars to our rebuilding effort in Syria there are a part of the pushback against Iran that included the pairing up with the Iran nuclear deal so the Trump Administration got very close to this administration and this administration is looking very very dangerous\nYeah let me get a guard jumping especially when you consider the fact that uh Mohammed bin Salman is so young he's in his early thirties and previously that was set in the context of oh he's so progressive oh he's going to be making a big positive change in Saudi Arabia for so long\nBut late but now we have to rethink well the most Saudi leadership and living to the age of Seventy eighty years old how long is she going to be in power if he is so reckless at this point\nThere have been some questions about whether or not he the power that he has might not be his for very long depending on how he deals with this there's much more want to discuss with this were were closing in on our first pause but let me get to some of your comments\nAbout what's happening with Saudi Arabia right now Scott ass on our Facebook page so now that he's an agreement with the majority of the world at ... dead he means of president\nWell he also agree that the likely killers are the Saudis or is he going to believe the outcome of the investigation performed by the probable perpetrator of this crime Wendy announced they find no evidence that they killed a journalist critical of their regime\nAlso Sonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grab any Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that show he's ... he was murdered based on recordings heard by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous turkey has not release the recordings but there have\nBeen leaks of what's in them Turkey's government not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior themselves\nWhat exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party [noise]\nInteresting questions Sonja I Would like to put that

center and the Washington columnist for the Boston Globe\nJames kid field senior fellow at the center for the study of the presidency and Congress and have brown deputy world news editor at buzzfeed news we welcome your questions and comments about all of the big stories making news around the world this week\nUm but I think that you know these elections were meant to be a benchmark for how is Afghanistan doing um six Seventeen years since the fall of the Taliban are sixteen years since cars I came into power and now I'm you know there's been several government sense so\nIt it's a it's very sad for the people of Kandahar and overall and I think this is going to suppress voter turnout with fears of more violence\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a\nLet's carry on with it attack yesterday as we mentioned the Taliban succeeded in killing the Kandahar provinces police chief general Abdul Raziq and it's provincial intelligence chief general of doom will mean\nThe groove missed its American target general Austin Miller but other Afghans and Americans were injured Hayes general or is he had survived dozens of attempts on his life\nUntil yesterday can you give us a sense of why these guys were targeted and and what that means for the larger us effort in Afghanistan well a large\nChunk of us efforts against the Taliban and the last you know nearly two decades has focused on kind of hard to heart is a bit of a bellwether for the state of the stability of Afghanistan\nAnd when you see a situation like what we have here where it is a total decapitation of the leadership\nOf the region and that's in such a strong message to the people in the other regions of Afghanistan that if we can do this here we can do this in your provinces as well I mean if\nIf we have a situation where all the top officials are not safe and Taliban after after this many years then where are they say where is their security in Afghanistan is a question that many will have after this\nJames kid feel give it to me straight we're nowhere near winning this war ending this war or we\nKnow we're not we're in fact we had a stalemate I Would say you know a year and a half ago when there was the first Trump's ... it's now we're now back sliding they've got more territory Helmand and Kandahar or no go areas basically and I will say this I mean I was with journal Miller like a week and a half ago at a NATO summit in Warsaw\nAnd were he was talking on background about uh about the upcoming elections if they had managed to kill a four star general something they've you know none of our\nUh none of our our our uh enemies and these you know long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have managed to do and it was a very near thing three Americans were wounded in this attack so that\nWould have I think probably been the death knell for our willingness to stay in that country so it's a very very near a thing and uh you know the best hope I think we can have now is a we have a new one boy there who is trying to resurrect peace talks but I don't see us winning this conflict\nAnd the ... ... go ahead\nI was just mentioning you mentioned the new unbelievable uh unfortunately they do on voice not working too well with the Afghan president it was reported\nA ... just the other day that uh he met with the Taliban secretly in Qatar behind a president in ... back um they did not let the Afghanistan government in on the talks with the Taliban which does not between that and the kind of hard to act does not show a lot of support\nFor the Afghan government and a very troubled\nTime where they would but by companies only make sure I understand what you just said this guy was supposed to be an on boy between the current Afghan government is led by president Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban and he's supposed to be go between right sorry sorry is American special envoys on may ... former\nUN ambassador uh he President Ghani of Afghanistan was concerned that the U.S would go behind his back to speak with the Taliban and that appears to have happen based on the Taliban a statement that's how President Ghani learned that the U.S had met with the Taliban in Qatar\nSo the Taliban put out a statement saying hey we met with the Americans and I guess as presidents like oh news to me who were ever any kind of an accounting firm for us to the Afghan government as to why America had the secret meeting\nSo far they have not commented about the meetings or nor would Mr clears out so now we have not had an explanation of how this actually occurred yet to my knowledge at least\nI Know we have to pause and a little bit in India I don't want to end up in a rabbit hole was much more we wanted to ask us on the ground up but I can only imagine what this means to families who have been part of this war effort who went after the nine eleven terror attack\nBelieving that this was a winnable war and now Seventeen years later after all the blood and treasure that we've invested here we are\n[noise] right well the effort on the United states side to have some sort of peace talks with the Taliban is actually a long standing thing that started under the Obama administration and even under the Bush administration there were efforts to try to reach out and figure out if there was some way to get the Taliban\nYou know kiss sort of pull out of this ongoing war in Afghanistan so efforts to talk and Qatar there had been those before they haven't gone very far I'm ... and you know Richard Holbrooke um the late Richard Holbrooke who was at a special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan under Obama\nUm did you know try to head to get a reconciliation process as what they called it going but certainly if it's true that all my college ... went secretly to talk to the Taliban and Qatar and did not let\nAshraf Ghani who let's face it lived in Washington for many years is a former World Bank official has very deep ties to the United states to not let our us allied president in Afghanistan know about it that does not bode well for the relationship either\nBefore we pause dreams where does this go from here\nWhere we have these elections coming up in a I think we'll have to see what happens there will be you know it will not be a victory I either way but we'll see if God is still around by the middle of next year the parliamentary elections this year and then presidential elections next year\nOr you know if we're gonna have to wait and see how that plays out but as I said we're at something less than a stalemate now I actually think part of the problem is we keep\nA surging in Afghanistan and then pulling out in hoping that the Afghan forces can stand on their own that's the strategy or each time we pull out a little bit too prematurely and and they are not able to say on their own I don't know if we\nOr join us but if we don't than this thing seems to me is going downhill\nWe always do welcome your
