A. M. U. and NPR this is one egg\nEither on Joshua Johnson visiting New Hampshire public radio today on one a the mid term next month's election for the answer a lot of big questions how much power does the Democratic blue wave really have\nAre these midterms a referendum on President Trump's for Republicans will line with him benefits or suffer most governors right now a Republican what will the margin be after the election and how much more diverse will Congress become\nOr were top advisor it's on the Trump campaign on so you'll hear him\nTry to very I'm very emphatically say if you send me to Washington I Will be a supporter for President Trump and his policies and congressman cuts are on the other hand saying you need to keep me an office in order to keep a check on this administration\nTo medical months in our Olympic come to you how does what we're seeing a New Hampshire compared to how these kinds of races are playing out in the rest of the U. S.\nWell these were two Senate or sorry these are two house races that were pretty close in twenty sixteen and they were they moved away from a Democrats and toward President Trump now that is reflective of what happened in twenty sixteen but it's also reflective\nOf the fact that in this mid term neither of those two races is considered a toss up race or even a lean race at this point uh the first congressional district race a which is the eastern part of the state and includes Manchester import Smith\nIs the race that looks like it could be closest but even that is a rated as the likely democratic seat and that's reflective of what's happening in a broader sense in this measure\nWanna summers what about the way that Democrats are talking about Republicans and vice versa it seems that there's this mix in various races between whether candidates are ...\nTo sing on one's ties to opposition of President Trump or whether they're focusing on more local issues how are you hearing it\nSure Joshua we've seen this in a number of competitive races across the country where Democrats are focusing really hard on highlighting their opponent Republican opponents ties to president Donald Trump making this election I mean you know in many senses most midterm elections are indeed referendum on the incumbent president but Democrats are really pushing to\nUm make to enhance those things to make them more obvious for voters as they are looking to win over some of those mess when independence whereas Republicans I'm noticing across the map and I think this is true in many ways in New Hampshire to\nThey're talking about what they've done for their local community local when local issues and really trying to keep their distance from the president in many cases especially in these districts that maybe Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen or where it was very tight between Clinton and President Trump\nKatie centers are there any of these narratives particularly in the pro Trump anti Trump comparisons tying the Kennedys President Trump distancing himself from President Trump but needs some fact checking how truthful have some of these ...\nWere a lot of untruthful narratives [laughter] I think one of them um that you just played actually my ... going off\nOn because they can't hit the Republican with saying that this has been going on for a long time we just didn't talk about it and that's in fact false that borrowed from Trump's own rhetoric or because the policy of was really being done by his administration families were rarely prosecuted\nUnder previous administrations but moreover we're saying I'm a stay on immigration or we're saying a lot of Republicans going pretty aggressively on Democrats who have weighed in on whether immigration and Customs Enforcement ice\nShould be kinda dialed back um we're seeing that in Florida and Arizona Republicans really hitting the Democrats for um\nReally even if they haven't said they firmly want to abolish ice I'm kind of hitting them for saying that they want to do it and that might not always be true so my general rule is just about everything needs context at least\nMy comic book nerd was so happy to hear you refer to your spider sense do you think you made my morning morning ... managing editor of politifactcom with is alongside NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro Juana Summers national political reporter for the a P and New Hampshire public radio politics and policy reporter\nChasing McDermott glad to hear from some of you about the big issues that have got your attention for the midterms\nJordan is in Auburn New Hampshire Jordan writes I Am absolutely voting as a New Hampshire resident social and economic policy matters a lot but my biggest fear and what I really want my vote to do to save the planet from its literal ecological destruction climate change and other eagle matters will hurt us more than people think\nLaura tweeted my biggest concern about the mid term elections to re establish some sort of balance of power nobody wins when only one side is represented I Would like to say I'm voting for bipartisan candidates but there aren't very many out there\nAnd Chris wrote on our Facebook page I've already voted as early voting started today in North Carolina poll workers revealed to me that they're happy we're having many early voting days as they would never be able to accommodate everyone voting on the same day November ...\nCasey give us a sense of what New Hampshire is like politically for those who've never been here in what ways does it reflects the other parts of the country in what ways as New Hampshire really unique\nI think in Hampshire it's really a true purple state we sent an all democratic into all female delegation to Congress which I Believe was the first for the state a Republican controlled every branch of government at the state level some of that can be chopped up to gerrymandering but I think it also just reflects the kind of\nA voting patterns that exist and the true you know kind of live free or die independents that a lot of New Hampshire residents like to think that they have\nIn fact independents are the largest voting bloc in the state they make up about forty percent of registered voters out of the latest tally so that can contribute to some unpredictability in election results and also can contribute to candidates who\nOften are um perhaps less extreme as you might see in other places toward one end up the political spectrum or the other\nI Know we've got to let you go in a moment but Casey what does the polling look right look like right now for the congressional race\nSo there's not a ton of polling here so we have very little to go on that as a medical sad\nBoats congressional races are looking like they are leaning toward the Democrats right now that said obviously a lot can change between now and election day so it it you know for that reason and also for the reason that I outlined given the at the political makeup of the state it could be you know could turn out differently\nWhat does it seem like it was going to make the difference these national issues or more local issues\nI think a local issues I think New Hampshire it's really a state where people are very plugged in politically to what's going on at the state house what's going on at their local town government a lot of the candidates while they will referenced what's happening in the national landscape and I think are increasingly doing that in New Hampshire on at the end of the day people are really building about what's going on in their backyard\nSo firing people up about say Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump isn't a hundred percent effective\nCorrect and I think people are ... are concerned with issues like the opioid crisis issues like health care issues like the economy taxes New Hampshire as a unique tax structure here so that you know can be very I their influence on people's voting patterns of\nCasey McDermott covers politics and policy for New Hampshire public radio Casey thanks for talking to thanks for having me

Sanders of politifact we love to hear from you if there's a particular race or an election that's coming up where you live in the midterms that you're watching very closely we'd love to know what's on your mind about that race or if you just have some questions\nKatie centers I Wonder what you're seeing in terms of political advertising and messaging during this election cycle it's been interesting is we've been traveling the country to look at the difference between ads here in New Hampshire\nVersus the ads we saw on TV and Michigan earlier this year versus the ones we saw in the Seattle area but are there any trends in terms of what the messaging looks like her sounds like\nYeah sure I mean I'm we're monitoring more races on the Senate and house level than ever before\nAnd it's interesting that you say they all sound different state to state because we've heard a lot of trends coming through one of those is absolutely health care and eat going deeper into it and we hear Republicans attacking Democrats for\nTheir positions on Medicare actually ... their more Democrats who are supportive as expanding Medicare making that are available for everyone and Republicans including Donald Trump or saying that this stands to jeopardize the program you know quote as we know it\nI'm On the flip side you have Democrats who are really going after Republicans for their votes on the health care law that's I'm currently in place\nSpecifically and you see a lot of numbers and mailers and TV ads across the states I'm particularly on preexisting condition protections are Democrats are\nReally tailoring the estimates of people who would be affected by the Republican laws that failed last year that would have weekend a preexisting condition protections\nAre they saying so and so amount will manners or Minnesotans a will you know had their protections jeopardized um so I Would say those are the biggest themes it's health care again and again\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a kitty I'd love to get your reaction to a listener in the mid west and the note that they left in our inbox\nThis was like in fissures Indiana I'd like the panel to discuss the fact checking in candidate advertising seems it adds stretch the truth and sometimes don't contain any truth whatsoever so I'd like to animals opinion about fact checking you understand newspapers aren't necessarily resource to do this on a regular basis\nMuch thanks for that comment Katie\nYeah I think he's right um that's the the candidates the interest groups are very tempted to stretch the truth that doesn't mean every campaign advertisement that you see is false\nOr ridiculous which we call pants on fire but you do see a ... that kind of succumb to that temptation to lay it on extra thick and maybe blur the lines quite a bit I'm so sure we see lots of TV ads are going after candidates personal\nLives or you know the most embarrassing episode a pulling it over the line maybe blurring what actually happens I'm like you said newspapers and TV stations radio stations aren't always equipped to do that kind of fact checking day in day out themselves\nUm but I you know I think that fact checking as growing in popularity we've grown over our ten years of being in business at politifact I'm\nAn ... I think you see more of a willingness to do this within stories about the ads themselves I'm certainly that's what we do every day we think\nIt I Would say that it's a good reason to support your local paper 'cause sometimes when a political ad goes way too far it turns into news on the campaign trail and then whoever your local political reporter is we'll follow up on that so just one more reason to support local media like public radio stations newspapers but the minute we should also\nBe honest I mean there's a lot of money in political ads television stations raking significant revenue every two years and that's a revenue stream ... it probably don't want to give up\nA no there's a lot a brand new shiny of what they called microwave trucks are in a lot of places in Columbus ohio in Las Vegas this year Raleigh North Carolina lots of places where you know they're kind of smaller markets and a lot of the money can go in\nTo those to those stations or you know the nice thing is we are able to see how much money is spent in a lot of those places because it all has to be public\nOr and you know sometimes those stations have a\n... you know a controversy is with the campaigns because some ads if they go so far over the line they are ... are supposed to reject them right\nBut one one I Wonder what you see in terms of the tone of some of these ads this time around particularly compared to twenty six team understanding of course\nThat was twenty sixteen we had two very different kinds of advertising ground games yet Hillary Clinton who did a lot more conventional advertising Donald Trump did a lot of online advertising kind of burned up Facebook but how do you see the difference between twenty sixteen is twenty teens ad was\nSure I think the biggest thing to go back to what one of 'em the earlier caller talked about that I've heard and seen differently is how they can't campaigns are approaching this issue of health care I think that several years ago you could never imagine that Democrats would be running ads touting their support\nFor the ... the act but the landscape is so different now you know\nI'm over for election cycles you saw the Republicans accused Democrats of messing up voters health care with so called Obamacare they vowed to repeal it they try they failed and giving Democrats an issue to really pounce on\nI think that we've also seen in terms of advertising a lot of these ads have gotten frankly and not just on TV but also in some of the mailers that we've seen really personal and really jarring and I I think there were some of that and twenty sixteen but I think it's gotten a lot more that way and twenty eight\nAnd if I can give you one statistic the wetland media group a witch citing a can't our media a which tracks a lot of these ads and buys a lot of these ads half of all the ads that were run in the month of September were healthcare related ads and most of those were pro democratic\nAnd as one of notes that is a huge shift from twenty ten and an ironic twist given that Republicans took back the house fueled by opposition to the Affordable CARE Act\nI Want to make sure I'm clear on what the statistic was half of all the political ads nationwide ran last month trial on health care\nThat's right and and most of those were pro democratic\nBefore we got a pause and the minute but it's amazing how surprising and not surprising that is I mean if you look at even Google's figures for what people have been searching the most in the run up to the election healthcare has solidly been the number one search for months\nYeah and I would say one other thing about some of these issues in the polls because a few recently looked at some of the issues and how far apart people are on them\nThey looked at opioid addiction which I Know a was mentioned in our New Hampshire segment or the deficit and healthcare as three of the ... and ... ethics by the way as the ... for a very big problem facing the country and all of those are places where Republicans are on their back for\nMuch more to discuss as we continue with Dominican lots of neuro Katie Sanders and want a summer still time to get in some of your questions and comments as well liberty emails you can't ignore it\nAll the voter suppression going on in Georgia a whole group of black seniors were kicked off the bus that was to take them to vote will talk about voter turnout and voter suppression in just a moment ...\n... ... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ...

A. M. U. dot org\nTweet us at one eighty or comments on our Facebook page where you can also watch or video stream of our lovely environs here at New Hampshire public radio also you can go check out some more of their excellent coverage at an H. P. R. dot org including of some of the things that make New Hampshire unique\nThis is ... from Charlotte my biggest concern is that people were not understand all recognize how important their vote is for this election and how that can have ramifications on the elimination of names from Boulder long\nHow can we be a country that champions and promote democracy when we don't make it easy for all citizens to vote not just for benefits certain party\nDoes it reflects for much for sharing your thoughts with us wonder what concerns are we seeing about voter disenfranchisement right now\nWe're seeing quite a few actually and Georgia is really ground zero Stacey Abrams who's the Democrat running for governor there\nHas said that her Republican rival Brian Kemp who is the secretary of state is effectively suppressing female and minority voters in that role but has its offices held out more than fifty thousand new voter registration applications\nAnd questioning their legality now at age he we'd done an analysis of that and we found that Seventy percent of the pending applications are from black Georgians now Abrams has said that her path to winning the governor's mansion\nAnd require sporadic voters younger and non white voters to show up so she feels that this is something that could be pivotal in her campaign um stretch where you also mentioned North Dakota\nAnd they're a federal court has refused to state a state law that requires voters to display ID cards with their addresses and\nWhile that may seem routine for a lot of people and it also really targets Native Americans and that\nCulture in many ways discourages having fixed addresses this is a long standing concern it's not just started North Dakota we've seen a lot of concerns about that are suppression across the country there\nI Do not want to point out that in recent years a number of states have moved and way is what our laws are now making it easier to vote their dirty and faith that approved automatic voter registration laws for those have happened this year\nFor example I'm Utah voters will be able to register on election day another number for the first time in Washington state ... uh sixteen and Seventeen year olds can now pre register said there are certainly reasons to be concerned and some of the state but I Do want to point out that in a number of states there has been progress to make something that should be a fundamental right and something easy for people to do even easier\nOn Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nTo get to a few more quick questions before our time is up questions and comments robbed tweeted I'm In a very Republican district Virginia's fifth district I just don't understand why the Democrats keep putting up extremely left wing candidates if they want to win\nJury tweeted how will immigration play in the midterms Democrats in silent Republicans are falling in line with the current administration is it a losing issue for both sides to medical how to use it\nOr you know immigration is one of those issues that obviously fires up Republicans are in the Republican base in a way that almost no other issue has a over the past decade or so\nSo it depends on how it's framed a you know frankly if you know Republicans are going to defend a family separation policy that's wildly unpopular if Democrats are going to counter that by saying that they want to abolish ice well\nThat's wildly unpopular so somehow the two groups have to be able to a message it appropriately and figure out what is going to win over the most voters I Would also say to the prior caller who said that\nThe Virginia fifth congressional race is not a competitive one and very Republican it's actually just a lean Republican district right now is rated by the\nCook Political Report and that's because that district is actually um [noise] you know you have a lot of liberal voters and you have a lot of conservative voters there aren't a lot in between and that's why you wind up a very conservative Republican nominees and a lot of very liberal democratic nominees\nKitty centers I Wonder for folks who are looking at some of the political rhetoric and ads that are out there right now who aren't sure exactly what to believe what would you advise voters to do is we get closer to election day to kind of be their own fact checkers ... what would you suggest\nSure I Would encourage them to squint as closely as they can at the television for that fine print 'em just because an ad has fine print doesn't mean it actually checks\nI'll bet for a fact checkers it gives us a starting point for beginning to unpack the truth of what they're really talking about soundbites never tell the full story\nSo I think you'd have to really think of yourself as being open minded and go after that additional information um if that doesn't that sound like too much work and I totally understand [laughter]\nYou can always just a supporter of fact checking we have a truth squad a membership program I've encouraged people to do that\nBut certainly always keep in mind and you're seeing these ads are these scary mailers that there's more information that we had here\nBefore we wrap up I'd love to hear from one end to the co what races you're watching most closely particularly races you think might be bellwether as for the country that might tell us something significant or one of which races are you watching most closely\nSo one of the races that I'm watching really closely is right here in ... right outside of Washington, Virginia ... congressional district if the race between Barbara Comstock the incumbent Republican and she's got a challenger and state Senate for gesture Jennifer wax and and the reason why I'm so interested in that race is that I I really feel that the road for control of the house of representatives is going to run through\nDistricts where there are a lot of suburban women voters this is a district that has been under Republican control\nFor three decades but in recent years it's grown more diverse with college educated young people looking as an agent's moving there which has changed the makeup and made Democrats really see it and reach for the first time in years it's a district Hillary Clinton won by ten points and twenty sixteen\nAnd and the real test I had the Democrat Ralph Northam beat egg lucky by twelve points in a very expensive race so far right now I'm the last five or so polls\nShow Jennifer Wexton ahead but Barbara Comstock has really been trying to make that local focus that we talked about earlier talking about all the things down in front the district\nAnd Dominican before we go what are you watching\nYou know I'd say I'll say on that that um bay area because Virginia actually is an early early poll closed time state so we look at another state that's an early polls close time said that might tell us something about\nHow the rest of night will go I'm looking at Kentucky and the sixth congressional district to Kentucky of Amy McGrath a former fighter pilot who's running against Andy bar the Republican incumbent if a Democrat can hold up and when as a
