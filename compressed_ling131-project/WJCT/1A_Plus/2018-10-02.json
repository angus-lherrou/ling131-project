I'm angry when a society going to stop putting the reputation of future\nOf male attackers over the dignity and future of the women and then they attack because Fifteen Years later I still felt like I was drowning listening to those here\nIt's just brought up a lot of anxiety\nAnd fear anger frustration\nOn hyper vigilant again ah I thought I was over that and and I just can only imagine how it's affecting other women in her country you are ...\nThanks very much to all of you who shared your stories with us we'll get some more of your stories in a moment but Lawrence Taylor many folks who wrote to us were contacted us said the professor Ford's testimony was triggering give me some thoughts on what folks who have felt triggered by all of this might do\nTo take care of themselves to take care of themselves to deal with that sense of being triggered\nSo uh hopefully most survivors and know what works for them there's a range of things in the moment the the most important thing to do is no that you are here now and not back when it happened\nSo that can take the form of feeling your feet on the floor\nFeeling the water as you drink it or just ... looking at the rumor around you and noticing oh this is blue oh this is textured um and and putting yourself in the current moment and then people have tons of other strategies whether it's\nYou know yelling into a pillow or petting the dog or gardening so that you feel the earth I'm most survivors in my experience no what helps them and\nAnd it can be very individual and that's the best thing to go to\nAn interesting show she kind of grounding yourself in the ... that I knew we have to pause and just a moment the professor Conan at what point is it accurate or or helpful to refer to these symptoms as TPS be\n[noise] ... um first well the reacting to this testimony as normal it's normal to have to be upset and have a response but if this um and I think these women describing anxiety insomnia\nI'm being really hyper vigilant if it's lasting for weeks and it starts interfering with your life like you can't go to work\nUm you're having trouble losing it out your kids you start to avoiding things that normally that you like to do and what that process then I Would say it's more into a pie TST him or diagnostic um you know situation where that I Would say you need to get paid perhaps get help um\nTherapy therapists if you have one um can be really helpful and PATS he can be treated effectively and you can recover from it I have my self I treated people for it um but that's really something of it if it starting to persist with your ... your functioning it's lasting forever you know in two weeks and months\nWe'll continue this conversation with professor ... toning and Lawrence Taylor and just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a firm W.

experiencing\nA sexual assault survivors react to Christine Blasey Ford's testimony we have received\nJust an avalanche of voice mails and text and emails for many of you sharing your stories with us we'll get to some of them today we wish we could share more but we're so grateful for all the ones we do have time to inclusive thank you for telling us your stories one listener key key under her email to us with the appeal don't ignore us\nAnd I happen to be actually with a man I was dating at the time he's a very dear friend of mine um who I feel very safe with 'em to this day and I\nYou know I froze I'm like a almost like prey like they talk about you know dear freezing I'm In the woods and I my reaction was to be so polite um you know which is really I think a fence mechanism\nOn something that's available to us I'm as women just to to get out of that situation as quickly as possible\nAnd afterwards and my friend who I was with\nWhen I told him who who that was we just run into 'em and actually the guy come up to me gave me a kiss on the cheek gave me a hug when change either in ten years this guy who assaulted you yes yes and so I was in shock and\nAwe after they left you know he and his his brother left and and when I did I turned to my friend and I said you know that's that's the boy who raped me and my friend you know ran out the door I\nOffensively and and um and he was very angry it's going to confront them and I was able to stop him and you know\nMy friends response um was really jarring because it really made me rethink um about my own um\nYou know my own response are non response and why wasn't either that angry and this happened to me you know I'm I think as women we tend\nTo uh want to be people pleaser and make everyone else around us feel comfortable and and not make a scene\nI'm even on our own behalf even when we are entitled to a real amount of of rage and um you can't help but feel that way watching Dr Ford testify\nOr so composed about what had happened to her you know and you contrast that with the anger of her legit assailant and I just think\nThe experience of of just the daily indignities that we go through um you know having to you know be polite she someone who is your sailing I mean I think I I think I had a breaking point watching her do that and others do that and and I just don't want to do that anymore\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day I Do want to give out a hotline number by the way if this news cycle or this conversation is kind of triggering for you it's bringing up some traumatic memories and you need someone to talk to or if you need some help here is the number for the national sexual assault hotline here it is eight hundred\nSix five six for six seven three again eight hundred six five six for six seven three\nLet's get to another one of your stories before we keep going geo emailed I'm uh forty seven year old survivor of sex trafficking I was brought into this country when I was fourteen years old from South America by US tourist I was too young to realize back then the my life was going to turn into physical and sexual exploitation\nTwo years ago the thoughts I buried so deep resurface so vividly the thoughts of killing myself we're constantly I recently got help with therapy and medication but what happened last week during the court hearings hurts so much as we survivors are being put down his crazy and irrational\nLorna you nodding I Would love to get your thoughts on what the Kavanaugh hearings will mean for survivors at least a few more comments about that because we've gotten several to that effect\nCat tweeted as a survivor of the hardest part of the debate over the nomination of Kavanaugh has been mocking attacking and dismissive remarks made by friends and family even as I have shared my story I have been dismissed as being emotional\nAnd another listener texted I'm a psychologist seeing clients for therapy between Wednesday and Thursday I heard two people sexual assaults stories for the first time alone with their beliefs that no one would believe them if they told\nYou I also had a client return to something we talked about a year ago a domestic violence incident which are a strange abusive husband was able to convince a court was her fault\nI'm convinced that if Kavanaugh is confirmed now it will have a chilling effect on women's trying to charge men with sexual and physical assaults Lauren\nThis is a really important part of the conversation so I'm as a survivor myself I had a really hard time when Clarence Thomas was a\nApproved whatever the word confirmed brand for 'em because I felt like it ... it was it was all the people in power saying to all the survivors we don't believe you and you don't matter um\nBecause of that and the memories of that which I Do feel in my body that moment when when the yes vote went through I did not watch\nI'm Christine Blasey Ford's and jet Brett Kavanaugh's testimony I just felt too unbearable to me I Do think that a ... that he gets confirmed or\nIt will be different not that it isn't the people in power are saying we don't believe you and you don't merit matter there is still that and it will still feel that powerful to many many survivors\nAt the same time now we're hearing\nHundreds of people saying me too I share your story this happened to me\nMine was slightly different and I'm with you and and people saying I have your back I Believe you so I think the cultural context while we have a long way to go has really shifted um and\nThat progress won't be taken away\nProfessor Conan I Know we have to pause momentarily but what do you think about the possible effects on survivors of the capital confirmation process before we have to break\n[noise]\nI'm hoping that the effects are you know in the long term positive that the public conversation as on the other guests have said um [noise]\nHelps people to feel that they're not alone um and that at least some people have their back as even as again having even if he gets confirmed I'm I've also seen ... there's been a lot of public evidence of men coming out in support and powerful men and women um and shows like this one so\nI'm hoping that in the longer term it will be positive for sexual assault survivors generally and\nYeah see change 'em that we'll see they'll have ripple effects\nOn the line I Would love to get your sense of the roles that men play in this me too movement particularly men who have been the offenders Jaime tweeted a male perspective is needed to move the needle other men need to hear from men who have been the perpetrator and why they did it I think some and can't get why a guy would do this to begin with\nAnd need to understand that part in order to believe the women more\nWhat role should men be playing in this me too movement will try to get some answers to that and more in just a moment single ups\n[noise]\nA vote in the

announced that it will raise its minimum wage for all its workers to Fifteen dollars an hour it's the latest move in these so called fight for Fifteen\nHow big a difference would earning Fifteen dollars an hour make for you if you are paid an hourly wage how did your rate get to where it is now\n'em they are much more likely to feel better and sort of recover more quickly than someone who's blamed or questioned or um something that people mentioned being ridiculed laughed at dismissed and that can be devastating and um\nIt really reinforces the owned the survivors own probably tendency to blame herself in question her own actions\nThat sort of normal after a trauma or an assault to question one's own actions because if you if you look back at what you did and you look back well I hadn't gotten drunk that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't done that\nIt can help you feel safe in the you know going forward I think well they just don't do that again I'll protect myself right\nOn the sort of brain that's how the brain works it's not it isn't the survivors fault but um there's something adoptive and ... and those you know and those moments of a questioning your behavior and if it's reinforced by someone you're speaking to or by the larger context folks in the media\nPoliticians that really is devastating and can cause someone to be silent for the rest of their lives and also not maybe get the help they might need or reach out to others who may be actually supportive\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a we have gotten a number of voices from men who lives have been affected by\nSexual assault here's one voice mail that came into our inbox\nHi my name is Bernie and I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I had my own that happened ... years ago more than forty years ago and I did not\nGo public with my story because of the crime and pray and went out and two I passed that world down to my own daughter and they've got their own stories and I refuse to shut up about it now because\nI have a granddaughter and I'm not going to pass the same world aren't there her\nWell said Bernie thanks very much like it would be Bernadette rather than Bernard my mistake for being so presumptuous butts ... emailed and more I'd love to get your reaction to remember middle emailed\nWhen I was fourteen I Would regularly group my stepsister she would laugh and giggle but also say no and stop I now see how I was wrong not just avoid being a boy I Want to apologize to my stepsister we have a decent relationship but it's never come up\nHow do I apologize without bringing up painful memories more what would you say ...\nOh well I'm first of all I think it's incredibly brave should take responsibility um and you know you have to you when you when you forgive when you ask for forgiveness you're asking for that person's forgiveness you give them back to power that you took for them\nAnd and I think that whether or not he's forgiven is is up to her um but I think that's a really important point because um you know\nWe're all human um we all make mistakes and some of us do you know commit terrible wrongs on one another and and you know I'm not a judge 'em but at the same time I do think that there has to be room in this conversation and in this country for some redemption\nUm you know but that only comes after a complete accounting of what you've done 'em and and frankly a it in I Believe should be in the hands of those who are wrong and\nUm and I think in the case before us with Brett Kavanaugh\nA you know there are lots of people who say well many Seventeen year olds um have made mistakes should they be paying for it for the rest of their lives um some are first of all I'm who are not as privileged as Brett Kavanaugh and and also a maybe not but that doesn't entitle you\nTo see on the Supreme Court um and so you know I Do think that there has to be\nFor a ... where do we go from here right I mean we can't ingest village vilify one another um but at the same time there needs to be accountability\nGoing all the power back\nTo a few more comments before at a time Mary Ann in St Louis emailed my fear is that a confirmation for Kavanaugh will sanctioned this behavior not just for adult males but for young men who are most probably more keyed into the story more than we acknowledge\nAnd lower and I wonder if we could finish with one more quick email Howard writes I have heard none of your speakers identify your abusers or attackers\nThe quantum leap Dr Ford took us to have identified her attacker I regret that none of your listeners has followed her lead to that degree although of course I honor the level of disclosure each victim shoes Lauren before we have to go what about\nNaming your attacker perhaps naming and shaming you're attacked or how do you view the impact of that\nI think you every person needs to do what's best for them uh in my case I don't know who was so there's no point um\nI I really think you know it's all about the violation whatever form it takes is all about having your power taken away from you so whatever way you can reclaim your power\nI'm not going to judge and if that means naming that's great and if that means not naming that's also grade I do think that what Mara was talking about\nOf of ah you know a holding someone accountable you need to name someone in order to hold someone accountable and that we're not just ... in on the individual level but on the societal level and start looking at ways that we can hold people accountable without locking them up um but

I'm In Chicago and I want to know what nailed that graph type thing think\nIs the best way to address people who are climate deniers and other people who totally disregard or are they interested in\nMatters of science that are by now well established set Charles Koch health plans most\nMaya thanks for that question I Would ask a Neal if you keep parents is slightly ... we got a lot of questions we'd like to get to if you can keep it a little bit tight we can get through plenty of them but I Love my question partly because you know my policy my journalistic policy here on a is not to debate the merits of climate change with guests\nIf we can guess who was a climate skeptic we'll discuss the impact of that skepticism but I'm not arguing as to whether or not the scientific consensus is solid what would you say to my aunt's question\nAnd while the ... the I'd be happy to so I don't I have a debate people ever or it's not my goal or am I my intent is to get people thinking straight in the first place so that going forward they become thinking individuals who understand what sciences and how and why it works and\nThen no one is left susceptible to this kind of thinking going forward because science literacy is inoculation against Charlotte ... against fuzzy thinking against\n'em all the other forces that are operating on us that would have us think something that is not true that is or think something that is true that is not so that fact number one what I generally do is I I'd simply describes the consequences as you've just said the consequences of thinking that way\nIt'll affect your health your wealth your security if you deny that objectively true science that provides those things those three things for us as we go forward and the evidence for this would be we would watch America just fade and every important metric worldwide as the rest of the country\nJust eats our lunch um in terms of the economy which relies on innovations in science and technology to to to grow and if you if you're if you don't understand what science is and how and why it works just moved back into the cave because that's where we are going to be in the future\nWe have so many questions on so many different topics there there is no way for me to string these into a coherent narrative so we're just going to go get a knock 'em out or whatever I come out and I ...\nI Know astrology is anathema to science but I'm interested if he sees anthropological or social our societal or historical connections between science and astrology I had an interest in astrology when younger but no longer still I think there are connections everywhere Neal\nThe first people who really cared about what was going on in the night sky where the astrologers so early data\nTaking a cosmic data taking was done by people who believed that the universe influence their life you have to look back at what you were thinking at the time that many thousands of years ago here you are you wonder went to plant your crops oh this star is and the moon and the sun or doing this in the sky\nAnd that's telling me that this was a good time of year to plant the cross oh when the sun is over here the Nile floods or the ... the irrigation channels open and you wouldn't be left thinking\nThat the whole universe knows about you cares\nAbout you is thinking about you is keeping you alive giving you signs and symbols and and and signals and so this this is a very um it's easy to see how you can be completely swept by this kind of thinking\nWhat science has shown us is the exact opposite the universe is cold it is doesn't know or care anything about you and the forces you want to ... to assigned to it um their gravitational forces obviously and and light is received\nThey're there to take to birth rates a full moon for example um people do the full moon to gravity and while the gravity of the obstetrician delivered you on you is greater than that of the moon on you okay but no one is getting you know no one is creating cults based on\nThe weight of your obstetrician of several gravity right okay so so there are ways to calculate and show\nThat all of this has no effect on you whatsoever and that there is a cognitive bias will you remember the hits and forget the messages that leave you complete that if you're susceptible to that\nCan can leave you convinced that everything is happening around you and somehow knows and cares about you\nAnd so do I am I going to chase after people who think this way no you don't like I said you don't see me debating such people but these people are have ceded control of their lives to fictitious forces in the universe that cognitive bias continues to have them think is true\nAnd that that that's I I don't know how else to put a good course in in the in the straw\nMe and physics will help you give you the mental um a resistance to this kind of thing and one in psychology as well to know how\nThe brain can be fooled into thinking that something is actually happening or statistically a in your favor that in fact a statistically random\nMuch more to discuss as we continue our conversation with Neil DeGrasse Tyson his latest book is called accessory the war lots of really good and interesting questions John on Facebook wants to know if you believe in aliens\nAnd Jay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis like a robot body or transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\nGee that's a really interesting question we'll get to that and many more in just a moment stay close\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] I\nDon't think storm like Hurricane Florence governments spend the money on it\nAnd
