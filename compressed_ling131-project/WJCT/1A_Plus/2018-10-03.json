hearing more and more about over the last several years since twenty twelve\nAnd now a major company Amazon dot com announces it they will go to Fifteen your state of California is going to Fifteen several cities across the country have gone to Fifteen in some cases hiring one or two cases we're going to talk about that too uh Sean tower I Want to thank you for joining us thank you so much for your time\nThank you so much the pleasures all my\nWhat we want to expand this discussion on minimum wage and a living wage across America not only Amazon and they are gigantic footprint in the economy but what it means for workers in other positions at the low end of the American pay scale especially as income inequality is worse maybe that\nThey were being certainly since the gilded age joining me for an NPR studio in New York is pulse on the state policy program director at the national employment law project Paul welcome\nThanks so much for having me and here in Studio with me is Michael Saltsman he's managing director of the employment policies Institute Michael thanks for being here things\nAnd also in Studio with me Sarah Anderson the director of the global economy project at the Institute for policy studies and co editor\nFor inequality dot com Sarah great to have you ... appalled let me start with you uh what did you think of Amazon's announcement yesterday more money for three hundred and fifty thousand workers at a minimum a step in the right direction definitely it it\nIt it shows that ... role ... cost competitive companies can pay a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and really shines a spotlight on the other big low wage chains like Wal Mart McDonalds and ms high towers or\nEmployer a Burger King to join them and their Amazon's just is the latest in a series of major companies that have agreed to to raise pay the Fifteen dollars an hour after demands from their workers target did the same last year and Disney just agreed to a Fifteen dollar wage for dessert workers\nIn Florida and California after a long campaign\nYou know as you noted it really shows the power of the fight for Fifteen lunch back in two thousand twelve by the striking fast food workers which has has transformed our national conversation in policy landscape around low pay and what workers can expect from there from their employers\nI'm In for for for Amazon it it came after as a company has come under increasing scrutiny for its employment practices you know there's been the U.S the the focus on how to you know a huge portion of its workforce earn so so little money they have to rely on food stamps and safety net programs at taxpayer expense to get by\nUm but in a lot of ways the challenge for Amazon will really be what it does next 'cause pay is just sort of part of what are the question's been with them there have been\nLot of business press a attention focused on the ... the harsh health and safety conditions face in their work warehouse in delivery workers there is a strike right now in Southern California by a warehouse in a in ... in trucking workers that survey Amazon and other companies\nThat have been complaints that whole foods after the acquisition by Amazon that pays gotten worse and\nThere's really a a lot of challenging workforce issues and really I think that the next question for Amazon is how it brings its\nYou know creative disruptive power to uh to build bring you know good jobs for its workforce you know and a Fifteen dollar minimum wage is really an important first step but there there there's a lot there are a lot of serious challenges facing the Amazon workforce now\nMichael Saltsman you take I think more of a pro business point of view at the employment policies Institute you say that Amazon got it half right what do you mean yeah well there were\nTwo parts of Amazon's announcement in the first part was that Amazon is is raising minimum wage which is is is news in a sense because it's the Amazon but it's it's actually it's not abnormal right now I mean there's there was a remarkable even article in the wall Street Journal this morning the talked about\nCompanies around the country even in states that are at the federal minimum wage and there was a distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky that was offering ten to Fifteen Percent raised in bonuses they're giving away I pads to trying to attract workers so I think a lot of this is is a symptom of of a tight labor market right now and I welcome the announcement 'cause I actually view it as proof\nI'm just like announcements in the past by target by Wal Mart by McDonalds by Cosco um that a government mandate is not necessary in order for employees to to receive a raise and in fact if you look at the history over the last twenty or Thirty years\nThere have been a couple of studies that have shown that it's very common for a minimum wage worker to get a raise within one to twelve months on the job\nSo that I think part of the announcement that I was less enthusiastic about ... a decision that they're going to go lobby for increasing the federal minimum wage um which I think is going to put their competitors who don't have a huge market cap at a disadvantage\nNow you mentioned what might happen when Amazon lobbies at the federal level there'll be talking to senators a Sarah Senator Bernie Sanders has enjoy putting a lot of pressure on Amazon and other employers he's accused him of being free riders in the economy like here's Bernie Sanders talking about Amazon yesterday\nWas this those today has is not only enormously important for Amazon's hundreds of thousands of employees who well the I think it will be a show her around the world\nWas the visuals and Amazon are now leading the way\nThey're innocent Bernie Sanders says this Fifteen is great but this is about the pressure will put on other big companies\nI Would go even further than Senator Sanders and say that Amazon's announcement should inspire people working on many other social justice issues from the black lives matter movement to the fight over the Supreme Court\nThis was a reminder that people power combined with bold passionate political leadership\nCan make a real difference in in this case it was a fight for Fifteen allied with Senator Sanders who really just kind of sound gets teeth into the ankle of the Amazon the yelling just would not let go and as recently as two weeks ago they were accusing him of being misleading and\nChina's slot him away and so there are dramatic turnaround on this wage issue should be inspiring and will create massive ripple effects\nWell we've been hearing from listeners on the issue of wages Brandon writes to us on Facebook it's very satisfying to see a company provide for their employees without being forced by the government or by the way Amazon was invited to participate in today's discussion the scheduling didn't work out we hope to have them at another time\nBut Fifteen dollars an hour east two times the federal minimum wage is that really enough\nTo get by in today's booming economy share what you know with us do you earned the minimum wage how much of a difference

A. M. U. dot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific amount instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured\nAnd maybe some of the conveniences that you're used to um are now either things you do yourself or things that are automated instead of being done by a person I mean think Amazon and a lot of ways with their Amazon Go convenience stores where there's no lines and no check out some new employees are sort of the perfect embodiment of of of the risk of raising labor costs to buy\nA you know it is true certainly companies could just pass on the increase in wages to consumers and maybe consumers don't want to pay it but but there's profit is well it doesn't have to come out of consumer prices I hear that a lot and it's true they might raise my prices\nBut I also hear how much money Amazon made last year and how many what thirty seven billion Jeff Bezos himself took home and that makes me say they can keep prices the same and pay people more obviously Amazon agrees they're doing it\nWell I think ... Amazon and a lot of ways is sort of the the the outlier and I think if we want to talk about the typical uh you know chief executive accompany according to the ... is not making a much at bays is just making they're making just under two hundred thousand dollars a year and so that is that is not a bad living at all but if you combine that with companies that are earning\nYou know two or three percent profit margins and have a very price sensitive customer base um that's a very different kind of company and I so I think we need to to keep that company in mind when we're thinking about and especially when Amazon is thinking about\nWhether they want to lobby the federal government on this point not every company as Amazon and not every company is going to be in a ... a decision to send a position to say we can pass this onto our customers are and in fact in a lot of cases we've seen in California ... companies are closed down specifically because their customers don't want to pay the higher price\nLet me take a moment to tell you I'm ... and you're listening to win a\nA Sarah Anderson there had been minimum wage increases in cities ... all across the country and it's given kind of a\nKind of a good research pool to look at now I'm Michael mentioned Seattle which is one city that raise the minimum wage there's been Washington San jose lots of other cities as well it's given economic researchers that chance to really look\nAt the the minimum wage in real life in the real economy real workers and real small businesses I Know there are competing studies we might get into a little bit of left ... left hook hook on them [laughter] but but take\nThe experience that we have now in his his biggest chunk as you can to minimum wage goes up nine ten Fifteen what do we know\nWhat let me give a little bit of a right Huck here on the Seattle study that Michael cited which has been widely attack for being having a deeply flawed methodology leaving out forty percent at the local workforce because they did not include\nCompanies that had multiple locations which would include the McDonalds that Best Buy that many\nLow wage employers there's a recent study that just came out at Berkeley that looks at six ... six cities\nThat have all had significant wage increases they include ... many of the ones that you just mentioned they\nThey looked at the experience as a food processing at food servers I'm\nAnd found that all of the fear mongering about job losses um has not proved true and and wages that of course has gone up so these are the arguments we hear time and time again any kind of new regulation on businesses is going to result in job losses increased prices for consumers and so forth [noise]\nTake a look at what's going on right now with the huge windfall that corporations have gotten as a result of the Republican tax cuts are they using that to lower prices or or something but positive no they're putting it into increasing the EL pay massive stock bat buyback center inflating\nThe value of their shares and rewarding their shareholders so\nThese are the old arguments we hear every time we're trying to have a social advancement that would be good for workers and they tend to not proved true\nOh Paul what's the best that we know now about the sweet spot look if you made the minimum wage sixty dollars an hour a lot of businesses wouldn't be able to afford that I get it but then there's there's this inflection right there's this sweet spot that the place where workers can make the most\nThat's best for workers in put money in their pockets before you get to the point where it starts to negatively affected business and they cut ours are caught workers were have some align effect on the very workers that we would all like to help at least I presume so do we know where the sweet spot is I don't think we know but ...\nWhat the evidence is Sarah's noted is is showing is that the concerns that Fifteen dollars an hour um was it was too high have the you know the the the most rigorous ... emerging new research showed that do those concerns were not well founded\nYou know the Seattle study they got a lot of attention some of the leading economists that initially taken notice of it have since I'm backed off and said they no longer find credible people like MIT is David Autor\nAnd then there's been a isn't really important new research that just come out using um it's a sort of the state of the art methodology published in the journal of labor economics which is one for a lot of plot at some looked in particular at the U.S states with the highest minimum wages and found\nNo evidence that they that uh jobs are are are are are have been hurt by a as these wages have faced in but I really think the best evidence is what we the business press in ... where we all see on the ground and the cities that are facing in these higher minimum wages you know take\nYou know New York or do you see where we were were were the participants are right now New York is phasing it it's Fifteen dollar minimum wage Thirteen now we'll go to Fifteen on New Year's eve\nThe restaurant industry is booming and cranes who your business is reporting\nThat the Fifteen dollar minimum wage is a is not hurting jobs and they are in fact a growing faster than ever in the ... the same is true in DC and in fact I Know you you were going to raise the tipped wage debate a little bit later but I think what's significant about DC is it's phasing in a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and\nA despite the debate over tips the Fifteen dollar minimum wage is not controversial in the restaurant industry itself is not making it you know any attempt to attack it it really\nAnd and we see the same in Los Angeles Chicago Seattle the other major cities so you know low wage jobs I mean jobs and restaurants retail the sectors most affected by the minimum wage really are continuing to grow strongly in the ... the only places they're seeing real raises are where uh where were these much higher minimum wages are facing\nIn the comments and questions are pouring in from listeners Jonathan emails I currently work for ten dollars an hour and with my experience Fifteen dollars an hour is closer to a fair amount it's enough to help cover hidden costs of employment like transportation fuel costs repair maintenance for vehicles tools close et cetera\nRyan treats you say it's common for a minimum wage employee to get a raise after twelve months\nBut I work for a chain of auto parts doors and it took two years and the race was a whopping\nTwelve cents Ryan ads the hash tag\nFight for Fifteen and Michael emails I don't buy that Amazon's decision has anything to do with altruism I Believe Amazon's decision had ...\nIt's more to do with the incredibly competitive job market and its ability to grow its job force in preparation for the holiday season if they can spin it in a way that makes them look like good guys will then good for them and I think some of our guests might agree with that coming up we have a lot more of your questions and comments about labor and wages today we're back in a minute stay with us

I I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happen to be in a one eight studios WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been\nA very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nYou know I mean she's exactly right I'm of the the one in three us workers I'm struggling a lesson Fifteen dollars an hour nearly half of them have some college some college experience and it it really highlights how\nUm you know pay has really gotten stuck on our economy and we really need there is increasing recognition and we need strong action to begin to to jumpstart jumpstart pay and wages and\nYou know a Fifteen dollar minimum wage which would raise pay for one in three workers would put a ... a month phased in a a a total of thirty five hundred dollars an hour or more of the pockets of that one in three workers so that's\nDefinitely part of the solution but we need a lot more than that we need to we need to restore overtime pay to to to also to uh to boost incomes for middle wage earners out the Obama administration expanded overtime pay and they\nAre a group of Republican attorneys general blocked it um and and the Trump Administration to ban did it but states are are moving forward and we expect to see more states jumping into give\nGive give middle class workers in overtime pay raise but more broadly we need a there's a growing recognition really in in mainstream circles that that um we need to give workers a greater voice in greater power in our economy to uh to to cut it read to rebalance things and and and steer more of\nOf the of this moving economy toward towards towards families in workers and so that that means you know restoring a role for for ah for unions and our economy it's been fixing broken labor law system and there are a range of other really important proposals emerging\nAbout um having workers on on corporate boards California just mandated women on a ... on on on corporate boards all let me stop you there just for one second just to tell people that I'm Talking about like and you're listening to want to\n... to head finish your thought you know and there were seeing increasing number of proposals on competition policy and tax policy to create new incentives for companies to invest more of their profits a share more of them with their workforces I think\nYou know of control of Congress shift and and there's a revisiting the tax code I think you'll see big incentives for companies to share more with their workers there is a renaissance and competition policy focusing on how\nThe role of of of giant companies like Amazon is is is another of the other major change that dominate the economy you're holding down pay and we really need a\nA multi pronged all all hands on deck approach to uh to begin a boosting pay and wages again and uh we're we're exciting that actually were ... there's more much more focus in conversation around it and you know step one is clearly a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and it's a fascinating\nAnd precarious state of affairs that it is true that workers are demanding\nBetter wages and in a lot of cases getting them but you said unions should be stronger they are getting much much weaker you said that regulation\nShould start to favor workers and not corporate head you're moaning and in fact the Supreme Court appears to be going in the opposite direction it's a story that is going to get written over the coming decades of Michael Saltsman I I Want to turn to you and and be companies like Amazon or Walmart or even some of the states out there and you mentioned\nThe tight labor market it it seems like if you're going to raise wages\nThat now is the time I mean companies are competing for workers it makes sense to pay better wages when the labor market is so very tight\nUm is the pressure for better wages are going to go away if unemployment goes up and evidently it will I don't know when I\nDon't think I don't think it will I mean I think it's it's probably going to or it may lessen um but I think that the I think the fundamental question um that I think that underpins a lot of this is sort of what is\nThe best way to sort of boost pay at the at the bottom of the pay scale in right now you have this sort of real bust a market dynamic and if it's some of that or decreases if if the economy takes a turn then we're going to be having a policy debate about okay well what what are other\nWe have in our toolkit to raise wages and I I think the ... the concern I think that that we have is that um that the minimum wage I think historically a has not only had some of these are unintended consequences in terms of\nReducing number of job opportunities um it also has not been tremendously well targeted um to to to families in poverty and so we've been really supportive of policies or for instance like the earned income tax credits a big boost wages through the tax code instead of through amended on employers\nAre and are intended to be much better targeted um to the employees who needed while not having an adverse effect on for instance a young adults I mean I I think young adults are often sort of forgotten party in a lot of these debates but\nYou know if you will get over the last Twenty years used labor force participation has plummeted as a as as minimum wages have risen you've got this summer you had about eleven million teens who still weren't in the labor force\nI think what happens is we sort of look around and say well as a as companies decide well we're going to eliminate bus boys as we are going to eliminate people who are bagging groceries it's we're going to limit cashiers um what happens to those young people who no longer have that first rung on the job later to move up\nWe're coming up on the end of the hour or ... your final thoughts because this debate is not over [laughter]\nI Want to push back a little bit harder on your um suggestions that ideas about restraining CEO pay or just something for the the left end of the political statement has world Stanford University did a poll that showed a fifty two percent of Republicans would put a cap\nOn CEO pay relative to work or pay that's that's beyond what I'm calling for it today though and that's a ordinary Republican so I think there is tremendous potential here to build a movement\nAcross the political spectrum to attack at the extreme any quality we're seeing today too narrow our economic gaps both by lifting up the bottom as Amazon take a step forward and doing today\nAnd bringing down the top and that would be good for everyone\nThat Sarah Anderson director of the global economy project at the

damage had been done to him and he yelled and filmed and was disrespectful to the senators and talk back to them and turn their questions on them he was incredibly aggressive\nAnd it was simply that she wasn't permitted to to use anger and he was it was that that anger could work for him um to help his case he couldn't use it on his own behalf whereas had Christine Blasey Ford turned to anger um it it might well have worked against her\n... that's the picture from inside the hearing room we all watched on our television some people were there live what about outside the hearing room what a juicy ripple through the culture or through the Senate through the country after Brett Kavanaugh's testimony after Christine Blasey Ford's testimony while there were several\nAnd it was one was that the stark difference in their behavior resonated I think with women everywhere it was so clear that part of her ability to be believable and to retain whatever credibility she could\nCame with her having to be deferential in the way that Rebecca describes and I think women understand that and so seeing it was a raging actually because the difference was huge I think too though that\nThat is that the darkness of it may be surprised certain people um who aren't necessarily thinking about the tight rope that women walk every day they they do this in their own homes they do this and the professional\nWorkplace and um to see it enacted in the way that it was as such a visceral\nI'm call to power on his part\nWas raging and I think for many people traumatic and you could see that ripple ripple through media you could see it in conversations on the street um it was just very evident in ways that sometimes you can describe the words but don't have the same effect Bernie Cooper what did you say\n[noise] um so what I saw was um white men sort of run into a victory lap at the expense of\nUm a vulnerable woman um and I saw these um expressions of gender that are so interesting to watch as a black person I'm who grew up with a little girl during the Anita Hill hearings are thinking about the ways that Anita Hill\nCould not um who she ended up in a similar position to her the lobby for in that\nThe the senators who listen to her were not did not find her testimony particularly compelling but she was not allowed to be vulnerable not allowed to cry not allowed to show even the range of motion that we saw Christine Blasey Ford being able to show and so I found myself and my colleagues who are working at the intersection of both\nOur racial justice and gender justice having to think about what does it mean to be in solidarity with Christine Blasey Ford in this moment act feminists because I Believe her and I believe women when they say that they have been sexually assaulted\nUm and I and I would love with the impression that even the men who listen to her whatever their political leanings also believed her but that they had made a negotiation that\nHer didn't matter if it was going to in any way diminish their sort of breathing bid for power\nAnd that is in theory aiding because it means that there is no integrity it means that there are no lives anymore it means that there are no standard that hold us\nThat we can hold ourselves to in this political moment that we're in a sort of crafts power grab a and and what I Know as a black person than a black woman in this moment is that white women cannot\nCompel the sort of a humanity of white men in power to do the right thing then that\nSays something about the vulnerability of every population not just white women but in particular people of color and women of color um and my level of fury over that in addition to my levels of fear are really off the charts\nNow this groundswell did not start of course with the Kavanaugh hearings we've seen women's marches bringing out millions of protesting women across the United states from the day after Donald Trump's inauguration I think you could put a\nPut a pain in that moment but even before in some ways of the fact that a lot of angry women are advocating for change\nIt does seem in a news story is something that seems like it's an aberration that women are angry and making their voices heard but it's not an operation\nAnd this is one of the themes Rebecca Traister that\nYou write about women's anger is not always highlighted it's not always paid attention to it's not always called that sometimes it's submitted but at this phenomenon as remarkable in his new is it seems is a new at all\nWell part of the part of the point is if the the people who have the power to tell her story is whether that means that people who write the history books the leaders even within ... certain movements the news media the newspaper's um\nHave all worked to hide discouraged or ask us to look away from instances in which women's anger\nI'm openly expressed has been politically catalytic has been used as a connective and coalition building tool and in fact if you look back\nAt the social and political movements that have transformed the nation from abolition and suffrage through the labor movement um the civil rights movement the gay rights movement and the women's movement of the Nineteen seventies at their start you will almost always find if you look really hard [laughter]\nI'm past the way that the stories have been told you if you will find women who were angry and began to be angry together and work together that have often ... the sparks under those social events and one of the crucial things that we're we've been looking at in advance even of Dr Blass before it's\nAllegations of assault is the power of that protest as it is a rough thing now during the administration of Donald Trump you mentioned the women's march is the that protest against the travel ban where so many protesters flooded to airports the majority of them women that teacher strikers ... in states where strikes were illegal\nUm ... and we saw that even before the allegations of sexual assault there were protesters in the Senate Judiciary hearings\nFor Kavanaugh protesting about the likelihood that he would overturn roe v Wade or got health care reform and you heard the way that the powerful men in that room responded they called them loud mouth and hysterics there is an anxiety about this openly expressed anger will\nGet into the ways that

now is a moment in us history for women expressing themselves in the form of rage and anger you can comment on our Facebook page you can tweet us at one day\nThe language that she used the thing I was struck by she was angry she was upset in fact listening to that clip you played of her saying I have never cheated in my life and actually reminded me of Maria Gallagher in that in an elevator yelling at Jeff Flake saying look at me look at me\nLook at me don't treat me like like a cartoon of what you assume I I Am right it was that same level of an desperate anger to be seen\nAnd she must have I have heard male tennis players you know there's a famous clip of of Jimmy Connors and his last run at the U.S open which everybody was thrilled about having a temper tantrum and calling the rats and abortion I mean he he literally says you're in abortion on I have heard so much worse language\nAnd and yet it was ... she was provoked into what then got got cash to some sort of spectacle of rage that became amplified because of all\nOf the associations that had been made around black women's expression of anger as either\nCartoonish inappropriate danger is a threat and the disruption and so she the provocation that Britain is describing then produces a scene that you didn't even on its it isn't even as angry or profane as it might have been\nAnd yet but comes the symbol of did a disruption that she gets censored for extremely harshly the whole cycle just reflected so much about the gender and racial dynamics that are around us all the time and that and that censure and

push off point for so much of this conversation in America right now this provocative moment the Kavanaugh hearings\nHas brought up a lot of many many feelings for women and and rage it unequal treatment not being believed\nYour pain and experiences and and how different they behavior was between you choose your professor ... and the nominee Brett Kavanaugh Rebecca Traister you you drew the line between those two\nPerformances of all if all call them that oh one listener left us a message with how this hearing made them feel\nMy name is Sarah and I'm calling from Syracuse New York I'm uh twenty four year old woman and I think that in my own experience of expressing my anger outwardly\nUm their reaction typically by men have ranged from um ridiculing to con horrible name to sex or anything my anger they can get the news and\nAnd I don't think that that's an experience that men share in any way I think the anger is taken seriously and seeing as\nI'm just the typical especially to the motion and something justified and I think that I've definitely seen that within the\nDr Ford versus um judge Kavanaugh trial and that she must be have a very specific way of the victims see how the skate declined between you know showing just enough emotion while containing or so\nAnd I'm Don Brett Kavanaugh could just really open the expenses rage\nI Want to add in one other comment from one listener Brian who wrote to us on Facebook anger is the emotion that keeps us honest really I thought it was the emotion that leads to assaults and lynchings and host of other unpleasant activities\nA Bernie Cooper the comment from Syria that we just heard the comment from Brian makes me want to ask you if men and women\nMight be leaving in two parallel universes here\nLocally and the and the universe that men are living in particularly white men at the University of power\nAnd they're in a moment of political power where there is an opportunity to restructure American society again so that it gives men benefits that they do not deserve that they have not earned everybody else and and look how\nCan skew your ability to see and understand reality and so this is why black feminist thinkers for centuries have said you have\nTo listen to the folks who have the least amount of power in society we are the people who are most connected to reality or grounded and who have an investment and making sure that we tell the truth so that we can reach the most marginalized and so yes\nMen's anger is respected it is seen as politically important um but what and what I Want to be very clear that if we look at violence in this country\nAnd it's the violence of angry white men and angry black man everybody from Harvey Weinstein's well Bill Cosby that puts women in danger\nAnd so we've got to talk about oh anger is not the same all anger is not equal all anger is not equal and its ability to do harm and we have\nTo stop making false equivalence seasons saying all anger in bed if you're a powerful and angry and this honest about your anger Ben you are dangerous to the rest of us if your anger comes from an honest and writes this place\nWe need to listen to more of that and that's why we need to listen to women that's why we need to follow women politically regularly women who are left leaning not conservative women were still drinking the Kool Aid and thinking that ally with powerful men and save them Christine blog before as a cautionary tale of what happened\nWhen you think that you can vote for conservative men and women will be said it is simply not the
