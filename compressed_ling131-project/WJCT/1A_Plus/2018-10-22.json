Kessler with his helmet on warming up morals had a ball cap and we knew it was about to happen in the ... now whether this is a long term\nDeal or a short term deals with other story morals that after the game that he wanted to find a sport and then he was going to reevaluate everybody in every position after mystery game losing skin so there are certainly still a possibility that ... could be back in there and I my gut tells me\nThat because of the schedule and where we are in a couple of other factors\nI think borders is going to wind up starting again on Sunday in London against the Philadelphia Eagles ... here's why first of all I don't think it'll be ... quarterback of the future he's a backup quarterback\nOr has some good skills as an accurate pastor that certainly plays a big favor one of the things that led to the ... was too many turnovers do borders been preaching taking care of the football he knows that his team right now doesn't have the weapons doesn't have all the top guys on off as\nA and they need to win games you know Fifteen to ten that sort of thing and giving them all away a absolutely\n... going to kill you in the NFL particularly if you're officers on high powered so\nI think they're going to go back with ...\nBecause it's a little bit of a shorter week with longer traveled all London plus you have a by week afterwards\nIt wasn't even consider is this if the jaguars where to go with ...

A. M. U. and NPR in Washington this is one egg [noise]\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson today on one eight Andrew Gillum he's currently mayor of Florida's capital Tallahassee running as a Democrat his Republican opponent Rhonda ... to keep the governor's mansion with the GOP by aligning closely with President Trump\nGillum could be a rising democratic star but his party has not won this race since the mid nineties will meet him ahead and get his vision for Florida's future then we'll take a broader look at this year's super tore all races\nOr to expand Medicaid because not only is it good for those who don't have\nInsurance is good for those with insurance\nMany of us are paying premium increases year over year without\nA PR projection because many of these folks who are uninsured of getting access to health care through emergency rooms which is the most expensive\nAnd least efficient form of care uh when we expand Medicaid we will be able to pull down from the federal government six billion dollars that are right now being distributed to other states because of Florida's failure refusal to expand access we're going to expand access lower cost\nA and put this date ... where we helped to make health care right enough\nBecause there's so much that we want to ask you about in the time we have you on the program mayor Gillum we're starting to get some great questions from our listeners I I Do want to reiterate again we did invite Mr defenses to take part in either today's discussion or a future date that invitation remains opens but we're for today going to focus our questions\nFor mayor Gillum before I started getting the audience questions one quick kind of two part question give me a sense of where you if you win the governor's race if you hit the governor's mansion give me a sense of one area in which you think Florida is on the right track right now that you want to continue\nAnd one sense of where you feel like Florida is most on the wrong track that you want to change right away whereas Florida going rate and wears Florida going wrong\nWell I I tell you if I could offer a compliment it would be to the fact that in the\nAt least in the Florida Senate there appears to be some bipartisan support in movement when it comes to criminal justice reform I in my state right now you're sixty percent of people who are sitting in jails are they are not because they've been found guilty of a crime but because they could not afford to pay the money bail system\nThat cost the state of Florida or upwards of seven hundred and Seventy million dollars a year to deal with that sixty percent of on convicted persons\nUh we've got to address uh uh the criminal justice system in this state and I believe it's a place where we can combined with right on crime which is led by Republicans who believe that we're wasting money and can do better or by the system um and I also think that there is a is a is a majority of Democrats who want to see something done\nOr in this space that is one area where I think\nWe may be able to work with Republicans in leadership or in the house or and if the Republicans main control maintain control of the Senate where we might be able to find some commonality some synergy\nTo reform the system and say Floridians money in the process on the wrong track I think we're on the wrong track around health care I think we're on the wrong track around our environment we got blue green algae flowing out of the east and the west side of the state because of the environmental degradation at the hands of\nRepublicans who have led to state for the last Twenty years were on the wrong track uh when it comes to our public education system were ranked forty at that if if if in quality and the average salary for teachers in the state of Florida is the forty eight low is out of all fifty states so there's a lot of work that we've got to get done are considering that we've been out of power for the last Twenty years\nWe've gotten a number of questions about climate and of course the the red and blue green algae blooms are not a new thing for the state of Florida they've gotten increasingly sick and they are doing increasing amounts of environmental damage to Florida's coastline on the Atlantic and the Gulf side and we got a number of comments and questions about that\nVictoria tweeted mayor Gillum what is your plan for dealing with climate change in Florida in actual real steps\nAnd Barbie asks as a Florida resident what will you do to help save our beaches and Everglades from climate change and pollution from the sugar industry may well first\nFirst they ought to know that when they elect me governor they will have a governor who actually believes in science or our current governor and and and Mr ...\nWho is been less than forthright about his positions on the environment only saying he's not convinced that global warming and climate change is real and that humans are having an impact on it well I Believe that science on this\nI Believe uh that humans um and that we are impacting and accelerating the warming of of of of of the earth\nAnd so one will believe in science and we're going to assemble some of the best experts that we can to help us to develop a resiliency playing for the state of Florida we said at the epicenter of the impact of global warming climate change and sea level rise we now have\nSalt water tables that are rising above our our natural bodies our our our aquifers and our natural uh bodies of water\nUm we all have also over the last Twenty years essentially handed over uh the role of the environmental protection agency to the biggest polluters in this state we were lax rules relaxed register regulation ... relax a comprehensive growth management planning in this state of Florida as it ... elected\nAs a city council men for eleven years and and now a mayor I understand what it means to have smart growth policies\nAnd the truth is is that what are they the pollution that is impacting our water bodies particularly Lake Okeechobee is not the singular um agricultural is playing the role including sugar\nUp but also big development is playing a role we're adding an incredible amounts of impervious surface a north of the lake that impervious surface has run off\nIt's increasing the level of nitrate that are in in in our natural water bodies and like oh\nWhen those discharges happen or it is now spewing a toxic water into our estuaries\nAnd eventually colliding or with with our oceans and creating the toxic blue green algae that we see a today we've got to start regulating that holding big polluters accountable developing a more comprehensive statewide approach\nTo growth management and growth a development and then building a twenty first century transportation system in this day and we're taking fewer call you know more cause off the road and using smarter ways to transfer a to transport people around and throughout the state in throughout our communities to reduce the amount of nitrates and and obviously carbon going into our atmosphere\nWe're close to a break but I Want to at least begin asked answering this particular question a James tweeted addressing housing affordability is key to our economic future what's your plan we're coming up against a break but let me\nLet you begin to answer that well let me say it'll be quick first of all I Will veto any budget that raised the ... fund which is intended to fund affordable housing in our state\nAnd I will work with local governments to develop a the kind of local ordinances that might help incentivize developers to build affordable and workforce housing in our state is a crisis all over Florida\nI'm Sorry what did you say you would veto any budget that raises Sadat raided the lay so for the last uh probably eight years consistently we have taken away ... funds which are intended to pay for and incentivized development affordable housing in this state from taking that money and put it in the general fund to pay for tax cuts\nThat money needs to go toward its intended purpose which is to expand the Affordable housing and workforce housing\nInventory in the state plenty more questions to get to with me or Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee running as a Democrat for Florida governor for Florida governor\nIncluding a question from Leslie Leslie wants to know does mayor Gillum belief he can bring more politicians to the middle we'll see if we can get an answer to that in just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a firm W.

L. c.'s and an escort don't pay the the the the corporate tax rate and I'm not proposing to change that either what we're proposing is for the three percent of the wealthiest companies in the state of Florida three percent the ones that pay the corporate tax rate\nOr that they will pay a billion more in corporate taxes and where does that billion come from\nRight now under the tax ... under the Trump Administration that same three percent walked away with six point three billion dollars of our money uh when they reduce the tax burden for thirty five down to twenty percent\nAbadi equate it to a six point three billion for that that three percent\nWhat we're simply saying is they can keep five point three billion of that money on going in increasing or ... or ... you know whatever so long as those those taxes which were made permanent exist for them\nBut we want a billion of that to come into the state of Florida so that we can pay teachers a salary they can live on and that we can re introduced into our\nPublic education system that kind of apprenticeships that used to exist in Florida would workshop mechanical electrical technical although those kinds of programs that allowed our kids to get a skill that they could monetize go to work\nGet a job earn a good wage it's a win win because we are training there next generation workforce\nLimits one comment about that very briefly and then Luis I Know we've got time for about one more question from you with regards to what ... what you were just referring to\nWander emailed for you to explain what she wrote as the one billion dollar tax increase proposed by him inside it in his opponents commercials wander writes I'm a Republican who was leaning to voting democratic and the midterms but a one billion dollar tax increase gives me pause so that's ...\nAnd again that's what I Want folks to be clear on this is our money\nRight this is the these are public dollars a that used to go into the the federal system obviously which also a winds its way down into the states\nThat were given away to the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest one percent I'm an ... and guess what look you know it ... elections have consequences that it past the President Bush did it made its way through Congress\nBut here in the state of Florida a we have a crisis forty\nOf the ... the state of Florida is ranked it's public education system is rent for to get out of fiftieth and quality right they increase per per per pupil spending in my state was forty three since last year forty three cents\nA our teachers in the state of Florida are paid the forty it low with average salary of all fifty states now listen\nI I don't want to pay any more than anybody else and and we won't under any of my tax proposals including for those corporations they will pay less under a governor Gillum than they pay under Governor Scott\nBut if we're trying to be a leading state than we can't have company saying I Can't come to the state of Florida because I Can't get the talent that I Need in that state to feel the jobs that we're creating where the third largest state in America it should not be our challenge that we can't produce the talent that we need for the workforce that we've got a bill\nMayer we'll pay for Illinois promise Lewis Lewis is one more question can you stay around for like two minutes after the break an answer a few more questions with Eric\nGood thank you will get so Lewis Hernandez says that question Lewis Hernandez from W ELL aren't in Miami as we continue with more of your questions for Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum running for Florida governor stay close\n[noise]\nHi I'm ...

Sasse about the state of politics and the country's future available for books are sold and from the listeners support this NPR station\nBefore we get back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about leadership it's understandable to want some clear guidance on how to be a leader a formula or a checklist\nBut retired General Stanley McChrystal says that search may give you some convenient answers but the truth is much more complex his new book explores the paradoxes of being a leader\nSo of course Florida is going to be a a big race this year I may be a bit biased considering that I'm a native Floridians it always seems to be a big race but there are thirty six gubernatorial races around the country right now are the one or two maybe other than Florida that stand out to you as the most worth watching kind of no matter where\nYou are in the country or Georgia it'd be want a Stacey Abrams versus the secretary of state Brian Kemp uh Ohio\nWhere are the former chief of the consumer financial Protection Bureau Richard Cordray is running against attorney general Mike DeWine a California where Democrats have one of their most exciting politicians on the verge of winning the governor's race there um [noise]\nA gamma Gavin Newsom Annan actually ah basically overnight Alaska which was until recently a three way race a between the independent governor a bill Walker a former Senator Mark baggage\nAnd um the Republican done levy who uh had been leading the race for most of\nThe cycle but a Walker and a surprise move dropped out and endorsed baggage so now it's looking like a competitive race in a very conservative state that uh could be decided by a single point\nMargin and this is something that Republicans and Democrats hadn't been expecting for most of the cycle I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a\nThere's a lot of talk about how the midterms will affect President Trump's presidency how do you see the races for governor factoring into that well the [laughter]\nUh it's funny a lot of people are spending more time looking at the house which is likely to flip or the Senate which I think is likely to stay in Republican hands but this class of governors is the class of governors that's going to a presided over redistricting redrawing the congressional maps ... for the next\nFew a congressional cycle so it's a very very important cycle and very very important moment for governors if a Democrats picked up somewhere\nBetween six and ten seats that Mike that might make it easier for them to draw congressional maps that will help Democrats get more elected 'em\nIf Republicans are are able to a staunch the bleeding in really hold Democrats to something like three or four\nAh that will ensure that Republican governors in key states like Florida like Georgia like Nevada will be able to draw congressional maps and uh to the advantage of Republicans who are running for Congress\nIt's interesting I saw graphic I think it was from five thirty eight that stated that Republicans hold most of the governor's mansions but the Democratic governors were out there governing larger portion of the American people so if you just do a headcount more Americans live in states that have\nDemocratic governors but more of the governors or Republican yeah and look at uh the I the more of the governors that are Republican is the advantage in the end\nBecause it state legislatures and governors mansions that decide state policy and draw these a congressional maps so if you want the population to ism is important\nBut we're in a situation right now where Republicans control Congress ah Republicans control the Senate and they have the majority of governors' mansions they have basically the three cards you would want to have a four elections\nMuch do big national issues like the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh factor into governors' races she heard mayor Gillum say he's going to try to play this more like a popular vote than an electoral college\nI understand the logic of that although Florida is a very factional state so there's the interstate four corners through central Florida which is heavily Republican the southeastern corner of Florida which is heavily democratic Leon county Tallahassee where he is\nIt's heavily democratic ... how much of a difference do these national issues make in states where you have deep red bans in deep blue spot so mean does it factor I mean it's funny\nUh right after around the time of the Kavanaugh hearings and the accusations of sexual assault a number of democratic candidates for governor tried to inject that topic into their races they look they didn't have any direct\nA influence like a senator might in Kavanaugh's hearings or appointment but they tried to make it a training issue generally though it is much harder for national issues unless there's some specific application to stay for governors to really um apply in their races\nNumber ... another point I'm Sorry I cut you short but another point to several listeners asked about that we\nDidn't have time ask mayor Gillum had to do with voter turnout you mentioned the Georgia governor's race in there are some issues both in Georgia's race and I believe the race in Kansas with regards to voter turnout voter suppression how much is that shaping the potential outcome particularly with concerns about voter suppression it's a it's it's a sincere fear\nFor some voters uh I was in Georgia last month and a Everytime Stacey Abrams would come to a stop a with supporters they would ask her about voting rights voting issues and if they're going to be a sort of\nA a attempts at voter intimidation order for the Democratic candidate the Democratic candidate\nA look I I I think in the states where ... in Georgia in Kansas where they the Republican nominee for governor is a hardliner on voting rights and has really made his name for a himself as a staunch conservative on voting rights\nThis is something that is a training topic in the race\nDaniel Strauss covers politics for political Daniel thanks very much for talking to us thanks for having me\nDo remember to send us your stories about

U. and NPR in Washington DC is one a [noise]\nA there I'm Joshua Johnson today on one a part for of our special series the state where at this time we focus on union and the ongoing debate over how much power they should have teachers' unions have been especially vocal and effective mounting strikes that force lawmakers to pay attention\nSome states are reducing the power of unions especially in what are known as right to work states will check out what's happening where you live and consider how we should govern organized labor share with you know about how your state deals with union email one day at W. A. M. U. dot org or tweet us at one end [noise]\nLet's back up to this case that will come up and sometimes referred to as the Janice case a Janice versus asked me a a a ... ... S C I Me it's the Supreme Court case that came out this summer could you briefly kind of give us the upshot of the Janice decision and what that means for collective bargaining in particularly in right to work states\nSure so uh simply put the Janice a decision which was decided in June as you mentioned was about whether\nIt was constitutional for public sector unions to require non members to pay so called agency fees to support union operation so in other words if you were a previous the Janice decision if in these um [noise] uh\nIn the states that are allowed public sector unions to require non members um to pay\nA these agencies\nThe these fees you didn't have to pay union dues but you had to pay these fees which we're supposed to cover the other the other activities that the union might undertake on your behalf so for example you couldn't be a public employee you didn't have to pay the union dues but these agency fees were supposed to cover the cost of\nUh the collective bargaining when the union went to the the bargaining table for\nYou and you you would benefit from whatever a it was able to get at the bargaining table this this fee was supposed to cover\nThat directly either way you had to pick something\nYou had to pay something right and it varies from state to state uh and the Janice decision the Supreme Court and this was not surprising given the conservative majority on the court or was that it was not a constitutional for public sector unions to require non members to pay a un agency\nAnd this is based on it being a First Amendment violation I Believe that was the ...\nThat's right it was a decided on First Amendment grounds and the question was whether in essence of public sector union as as a because it's public as a government entity I'm In a sense was allowed to to um\nTo uh again taking the or the point of view of opponents of of these sort agency fees that it was sort of an infringement on your First Amendment rights to force you to uh pay for something that for activities perhaps political activities that you didn't agree with\nAnd just to be clear when we're talking about paying for other activities this has to do with like the professional staff that works full time for the union attorneys representatives et cetera whose whole job is to know about contracts know what other unions are doing and kind of negotiate on that basis\nThat's true but of course it's also true that the unions are very active politically and that they are active in supporting um almost entirely the Democratic party and therefore conservatives who supported this decision to argue that it wasn't right for people to have to pay for activities that they might not agree\nWith what's being discussed Greenberger executive editor of state line glad to get some of your thoughts on the proper place of unions in our society and in our workforce is\nShane emailed I'm strongly against unions having too much power in an era of stagnant wages an ever increasing cost of living excesses of the rich lack of access to health care and politicians naked least supporting business interests over labor I think unions have never been less relevant\nScott emailed unions built the middle class as unions have declined it's really hurt middle class workers this is why wages have not been increasing we need to make it easier to unionize to counter the power of big business\nLet's add a few another voice to our conversation now it's no coincidence that these strikes these teachers strikes we mentioned earlier happened in right to work states like West Virginia Oklahoma North Carolina\nTeachers say when they don't have a collective voice at the bargaining table they have no choice but to go on strike and the picket industry now following the strikes hundreds of teachers decided to run for office they say they're fed up with the status quo one of those teachers is Sarah Duncan she teaches visual arts in ...

Scott before the Janice ruling a few states preemptively passed laws to try to protect unions from whatever the ruling might involve what exactly did the states do or try to do\nSo the idea I mean what are the pro union states were afraid of what the Janice decision was that uh it would undermine the financial stability of unions um and so they took steps are that were designed to to um\nTo pump up membership in unions to to give the unions a better chance of keeping their membership\nUp and their and their finances um stable so for example a New York which is the most heavily unionized state in the country I'm now has a law which gives unions the right to meet with new hires during the work day requires public employers to give unions contact information for new hires\nAnd also allows unions to give extra services to their members um other states have taken some steps all with the goal of making it easier for unions to retain members\n[noise] let me get through a few more of your comment summer wrote on our Facebook page I live in Kansas and I'm a postal carrier I Love being a part of the union to keep our pay fare most companies around us will tell you if you speak up with a union rep you'll be fired\nIt makes you wonder what the company's agenda is or what did they profit from employees not being represented by a union\nWe also got a voice mail from a listener county in Ohio who explain what she's been seeing when her state transition school bus drivers from unionized workers to non unionized workers here's what Connie left in our inbox\nI Belong to open the Ohio association of public school employees\nI just want to make a comment about unions and privatizing bus transportation privatized mass transportation sit kissed sticks for safety are deplorable\nCompared to bus drivers that are unionized and dry for their particular school district\nThe uh differences are absolutely amazing you want a union worker that cares about their job that cares about their children first and foremost that they transport\nUh you can't be a union member\nConnie thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Vincent her new show I'd love to get your reaction to what tiny said\nHey listen I'm you know we support union members and um you know believe that obviously when you're talking about bus drivers school bus drivers republic employees that it is it's the taxpayers it's the children and the police themselves that we have to focus on\nI'm going back to a you know something that Randy was talking about about the funders I mean these false and exaggerated on having um attacks are designed to undermine education effort education efforts aimed at the exact people that county was talking about\nUm like Scott was talking about before you know there have been bills introduced in past in states around the country to circumvent the rights that were bestowed from the Johns decision\nAnd trap public employees into paying unions even if they don't want to or they disagree with the unions politics\nI just want ... because I Know we're coming up on a break it sounds like honey was saying that union members from her perspective just do better work\nThat I think that's a matter of perspective union member or a non union\nAnd I believe all public employees care about especially those in the teaching profession or those taking care of children care about those children so one said union member or not um cares more than let's say a non union member\nI Do want to give Randy a chance to jump in when we continue our conversation with Randi Weingarten if the American federation of teachers Vincent for new CEO of the Mackinac Center for public policy Scott Greenberger says the line and we'll get to some more of your questions and stories as well stay close\n\nAcross the country colleges are beginning to offer students nor can in case they need to reverse an opioid overdose\nWe felt that he was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic affects every ...\nOthers question if it could encourage drug use that story plus\nThe fallout from Jamal ... this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News today at Fort on eighty nine nine W.
