A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one [noise]\nWhen officer Van Dyke and his partner got on the scene they were on the scene for for less than thirty seconds when uh observe and I got out of his car and within six seconds he started shooting he unloaded his gun into a corner McDonald's hit him all all sixteen times\nCurtis tweeted it absolutely must be pointed out the Chicago sat on the video for a year and only released it after a court order Van Dyke was only arrested after Chicago was forced to release the video Patrick why did it take so long for this video of the incident that come out\nThat really depends who you ask you know the official ah what what city officials say is that the policy from you know since forever has been that when there are investigations going on you don't release evidence and this video was evidence and they say and investigation both\nBy the city to see if any any you know police rules were broken and also by the state's attorney's office to to see if they were going to file criminal charges a I think that there are many many people in Chicago who don't quite buy that who believe that this video was kept under wraps because it looks really\nThat ah you know the city paid like McDonald's family five million dollars um without a lawsuit ever being filed which is not you know that's not the only time that that's happened but it is it is rare and part of the agreement was that the video would not be released um at least well these investigations were going on\nNeal Franklin let me come to you the matter of kind of a code of silence that many civilians perceive in law enforcement is definitely front and center here as was mentioned by Patrick officer Van Dyke had a number of complaints against him how often do you see it just taking a little bit of a step back from Chicago more broadly\nHow often do you see it that officers with controversial records with complaints about excessive use of force find themselves protected by their colleagues particularly protected from accountability for their actions\nWell it's quite often uh this is part of the culture that needs to be change\nA nationwide um\nYou know ... police officers who especially today feel that they're out there by themselves and [noise]\nUm that most of the public has sided against them which is not true by the way I'm so they form a very tightly close knit circle of protection among themselves and it usually takes quite a bit\nFor officers to come together to to I'm\nFrom North port move someone out\nI'm Sorry what did you just elaborate on that idea in terms of being in it by themselves what do you mean by that\nAnd so have you you know video has exposed\nThe ugly underside of policing today\nWhat I mean by that if you go on YouTube today you can see a number of cases involving excessive force\nThe lack of transparency how police officers negatively interact with citizens they curse at them they disrespect them they used excessive force whether it involves you know deadly force or other means the overreact\nAnd now with the you know with everyone literally has a video camera in the palm of your hand we have\nBody came so we have ... these videos are surfacing one after another and we're really beginning to see what citizens have been complaining about for decades in this country regarding the abuse\nOf certain police officers are working in their communities and this is cause citizens to begin to push back\nAt alarming numbers ... the protests that we're seeing across the country and now police are circling the wagons and you know they're they're they're forming a circle of protection there they're behind each other and they realize that when they're out there working in the streets and some of these neighborhoods are dangerous\nQuite dangerous they realize that you know there are backup could be the the officer that uh they protected yesterday from some sort of complaint\nDriven by siding with them so they are a number of reasons why you know the police of foreign this very close knit culture of touching among themselves which prevents officers like Van Dyke of Patrick talked about the number of complaints unsustainable complaints that this guy's head\nAnd that is because apparently the evidence has not been there you know to to sustain these complaints and what evidence am I talking about statements from\nPolice officers who may be on his squadron may have witnessed something because when it comes down to when police are investigating their own they want to believe the statements and versions of their police officers before they will believe that if a citizen and that's why video is so important\nWell I'm also curious George Cordell in terms of how far up the changes efforts to protect officers who use excessive force go I mean you had a big job dealing with San jose police department which you know San jose is the largest city in the San Francisco bay area it's a city of about a million people significantly larger than San Francisco it's self\nTalk about some of what you saw in that big city in terms of the impediments to getting at the root of bad policing what it shows up\nSo it it's an important first of all to understand that when you talk about the police it's not a monolithic group there's generally the rank and file and that refers to the union and then you have the leadership that command staff and really what what controls\nWhat happens with the police department is really the rank and file police unions are\nVery very powerful in this country and while the power of other unions in other professions has declined over the last eight and two two decades the power of cliche onions has grown so that that I found to be\nNot just in San jose but everywhere to be the biggest obstacle to getting police departments to be more transparent and to be able to hold police officers accountable on police departments historically are resistant\nTo any kind of oversight at all and and the attitude pretty much is look we have the training\nWe went to the academy ... civilians have to even say what we're doing is wrong or right and the result of that is that you have police basically policing themselves in any kind of institution that polices itself means that they're they are not being held\nAccountable by those says\nLived there impacting and any systems that police will tell our rights for corruption and that's what's what tends to happen in law enforcement and when you have police department however that are very uh more open minded and more receptive Laura ... having oversight right ran death came the case in San jose now hold\nOn ... and we we got to pause and just a second I'm Sorry to cut you short but I Do want to get more into that when we continue our conversation ... tied for just a moment if you would please I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a firm W.

A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments before we keep going Nick is in Wilmington North Carolina\nA kind of now there has to be a mutual respect both ways and I think\nWith the Jason Van Dyke trial it is over the verdict is and we cannot go back and change the mistakes of the past but we absolutely must\nLearn found on and go forward in a positive direction because of what side on silicon\nMcDonnell Jason Van Dyke ... I Can't call it re that Chicago needs to move forward in a better direction and we need to get to gather the police and the citizens or we won't be able to make a difference\nI should know by the way we did reach out to the administration of Chicago's the current Mayor Rahm Emanuel for comment regarding officer ... case it did not respond W. B. C. is reported that the mayor and his administration has denied that there was any retaliatory treatment for officers bowling's actions but the mayor's office did not respond to us that invitation\nIs still open let me get to a few more of your comments Jim emailed\nThe public should take some comfort from the fact that there were many more officers president when ... McDonald was killed and they acted with proper restraint only Jason Van Dyke acting on raw emotion that said the institutions to police unions the police command structures the arbitration process is and the city administration certainly\nNeed reform and more transparency I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one day\nPatrick let me bring you back in here is a clip from the Reverend Martin hunter he was the great uncle he is the great aunt uncle of the late ... McDonald this is what Reverend hunter had to say after the verdict against officer Van Dyke was read\nI Can't rejoice in a way you know to say ... because this man is going to jail when I looked over and I saw his wife my mind had to go to his his daughters his wife who didn't pull a trigger his daughters who didn't pull a trigger his father\nHe didn't pull the trigger I could see the pain and those people and it was touching my heart to see that pain\nBut it was also touched bothering me that they couldn't see the pain that was within a ... they never they never really gave their condos and everybody that try to come to us on behalf of Jason Van Dyke\nThey came to us asking us could we forgive Jason Van Dyke and I want the world to know that you can't just go around a given people who never won didn't think they'd done anything wrong\nWho never to never asked for forgiveness Jason Van Dyke has never asked this family for forgiveness period at all\nPatrick I Wonder what the conversation has been like in Chicago after the verdict what the response has been I have to say personally I was surprised\nTo hear river and hunter put some distance between forgiveness and Jason Van Dyke especially based on what Christian theology says about forgiveness but I also understand like he lost a loved one how our Chicagoans talking about this particularly in terms of being able to move forward or even forgive\nWell I think uh I haven't heard from a lot of people who who are willing are interested in forgiving officer Van Dyke I mean I think it depends on who you're talking to there are\nMany in Chicago who don't believe that officer Van Dyke needs to be forgiven who think that he was putting a tough situation and did what he\nWas forced to do a even after the verdict I Believe that and there are many others who are who are glad about this verdict and and and believe that this is justice being done I I agree with you about you know the Christian beliefs in in forgiveness however as as revenue hunter's said right there\nUm you know officer Van Dyke has maintained that he did nothing wrong obviously there are legal reasons for that the why he would maintain that but but I it is hard to forgive someone who who is not admitting admitting fault are asking for forgiveness\nUm but no I I have heard um the Chicago is that I've talked to a who believe that officer Van Dyke you know was guilty they are they are gratified by this verdict and they believe that him spending a long time in prison it would be justice\nAaron writes when you read how the Chicago police union responded to this conviction I'd say that there's not much hope for real reform they believe the conviction was wrong evidently it's okay for the police to murder someone in the course of doing their job\nRichard wrote in our inbox my nephew is a police officer who told me that they have a saying better to be tried by twelve\nThen be carried by six\nPresumably meaning that it's better to deal with\nThe criminal justice system than to be shot on the job new Franklin I have to pause and just a minute but could you speak to this idea of the mentality of officers and this this cone of silence I mean there are officers who want corruption rooted out there's also the police union which has to speak in the larger sense protect every single officer who is a dues paying\nMember ... how do you see this before we have to break\nYour first um just to comment on what judge Cordell said about unions unions and their power\nAnd the other thing she said it was about police oversight\nAnd we need community oversight of police department and move away from police policing the police are just went and that's a whole nother story as it relates to the mentality in the process of these officers I mean also Spalding hit it right on the head you know what she was talking about is absolutely correct\nWhat I Want to say something about the officers who would come to her and speak to her and and all those officers out there who don't want this type of policing who don't want the corruption who don't want the officers like Van Dyke who have these many many complaints\nIf they were to come together their numbers are so much greater if they were to come together\nAnd and and and form a movement to move these officers out of the ranks so they can be the police officers and departments that they want to be for their citizens\nWe wouldn't have this but if they're not capable of doing that we need community oversight of these police department so I just want to push push back on that just a little bit because\nTalking about the few bad apples you know the ones who do come forward like sporting did are they not also problematic in allowing this to occur\nEmile I'm Sorry I I I hate to cut you short we're going to pick this conversation up on the other side of this break but I Need to get to a little bit of breaking news that has\nCome out since

I Love you to react to something that the president said yesterday he was speaking before the international association for the chiefs of police conference in Chicago and she said the following listen\nFive do them to work with local authorities to try to change the terrible deal the city of Chicago entered\nInto with a C.

I Am a white Irish female blonde hair blue eyes and that was dropped into the Chicago housing projects which was all African American and if you are in opposite that\nTakes the aisle to serve and protect everybody equally seriously you can adapt and officers must be able to adapt to every single community and beat their across the board\nI was able to do it in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the nation kill officers need to remember it doesn't have the white people and white um neighborhoods are black and we all work\nTogether but Chicago police officer Shannon Spalding Neal Franklin executive director of law enforcement against prohibition WB easiest Patrick Smith and retired judge will adores Cordell everyone thanks for talking to us the show was produced by Morgan givens to learn more about him and the rest of our team visit the one a dot org slash death\nThis program comes to you from W.

talked about the more you have it and it's completely universal\nThe own we know from now probably sixty years of research that the only people who don't experience shame that kind of warm wash that

and like it doesn't work\nBecause shame drives denial rationalizing and anger\nAnd we do it because it feels good someone that sets us wish you know we want we shame them\nBut it never leads to meaningful change\nSo that shame let's define vulnerability what do you mean by vulnerability particularly because I think uh there are many definitions depending on who you ask them what it means\nTo be vulnerable whether that just means kind of living all of your guard down one of our listeners emailed I Am in a small office five people my boss is very guarded my coworker isn't over share we're I'm In the middle saying I'm\nHappy [laughter] I just want to work from home [laughter]\nSo what exactly do we mean by vulnerability it's not over sharing and telling everybody everything right\nNow so ... a simple definition it's the emotion we experience during times of uncertainty risk and emotional exposure it's that feeling that we get when we put ourselves out there and we can't control the outcome\nYou know when we ... we that thousands of people to define vulnerability for us and the answers range from the first date after my divorce sharing a new idea with my boss giving someone difficult feedback trying to get pregnant after my third miscarriage coming out to my parents\nI'm sitting with my wife who has stage for breast cancer and talking about plans for our two year old and four year old starting my own business telling my family members who invested in my business that we failed\nYou know vulnerability is the willingness to show up and put yourself out there when you can't control how that's going to go\nNow several of those examples you gave half the do directly with the world of work sharing an idea get feedback starting a business seeing you failed the point that I get from your book is that creating space for vulnerability at work is kind of the core of doing anything as a company worth doing no matter what your company's doing\nThat's exactly right and you know I'll tell you that's 'cause you'll appreciate that Josh I think\nI used to spend what I Would go into these organizations and just like you detailed they would say oh my gosh we really want you to come but please don't talk about vulnerability I'm like well I'm kind of I'm Talking about vulnerability so I used to spend like half an hour trying to convince them and then one day I found myself on a base talking to\nA hundred special forces troops and\nI just ask one question\nThe definition of vulnerability is uncertainty risk and emotional exposure can anyone ... give me a single example of courage that you've seen or witnessed in your life that you yourself have engaged in\nThat did not require uncertainty risk and emotional exposure and there was just dead silence and finally a young man raised his hand and said no ma'am three tours there is absolutely no courage without vulnerability\nWe're speaking to burn a brown her new book is called dear to lead we welcome your questions and thoughts as well ... emailed\nI Am a social worker my boss is a social worker all of my coworkers or social workers or director ensures that we are not only empathetic towards one another but empathetic with clients in the community that we serve we treat each other we treat others as we should wish to be treated\nI Know we have to pause in a moment but that's another term we should define empathy waters empathy use it as kind of\nGolden rule mentality or is there a little more to add to that\nThere's actually for skill sets that enter pen at the the the good days as it can be taught that empathy I think in a nutshell is feeling with people not feeling for them sympathy is oh man bless your heart like\nThe Texas from west your cars I sure heart righteous chills up your side to the poor thing of feeling for\nWhich which really\nJust magnifies shame\nKind of pushes you away I was like well it's almost like saying I'm Glad I'm not where you\nAre is it ... it's really bad it's yeah it's bad as you think but I'm over here with that kind of stuff that happened and empathy is feeling with someone it's not taking on their emotions but it's saying yeah me too\nIt's it's kind of I'm Glad you said me too that's kind of it feels like it's the power behind that whole absolutely if you talked to trying to work and who knows who the creative to be creative\nWith me to move that um it's all about empathy it's about you know and it's so funny because every now and then a word like empathy or authenticity comes at yeah into the firing line of researchers like I don't think that these good after all at the is great because here's the thing\nIs not vulnerability without boundaries empathy is not empathy without boundaries\nIf you're having a hard time and your data that whole\nI say I see you at I'm Down there because I\nWant you know you're not alone I don't just jump in there and just the miserable with you\nWith our conversation with

A. M. U. dot board\nAnd wholehearted and us but do you want to be in the ... do you want to be in a place where physicians nurses administrators are afraid to do the wrong thing say the wrong thing\nThat's were accidents happen\nIt is because what happens when we can't be human\nIs that we hide mistakes we don't talk about them we don't ask for help and so it is about setting an intention as a culture and from both top and bottom building that culture again so armor is not rewarded or necessary\nI'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a\nGot a number of comments excuse me got a number of comments from several of you about dealing with this trust among your leaders particularly leaders who have proven themselves to be on trustworthy\nConstance is in Silver Spring Maryland just outside D.C Constance emailed my most recent boss made a hobby of cruelty she always picked out one new person as for special target and did everything short of physical assault to make their life miserable including trashing their reputation with supervisors one year\nI was the target everyone knew what was going on she just likes to be mean I was told no one intervened at the time I could not afford to quit I Would like to know how you can be yourself at such a workplace you can't\nYou can't because it's not emotionally or physically it doesn't sound emotionally or physically safe\nBut what I Would say is that as time limited I don't know when you stay in a situation like that and many of us had to have had to stay in jobs that were that South abusive\nBut you cannot do it long term and if there's not someone who in a leadership position that you can talk to about this uh you know really freely and say how do I manage this\nHow do we hold this person accountable how can I get some protection from this culture\nI think time is short in that position\nJennifer wrote on our website the one eight dot org there's a lot of good are done in rural communities and families but the suppressed emotions or one of the reasons that farmers commit suicide at a high rate if you do not know how to express and accept uncertainty and vulnerability it can literally kill you\nThat leads me to a question about regional even national differences how have you found that workplace cultures differ across the country around the world how do I do use about shame and vulnerability manifest differently depending on where you are\nDrawn interesting parallel that I think you'll be interested in it's the same question that I got after I finished the original shame research around religion or their denominations that are more shaming yeah everyone wants to know about the Baptists in the Catholics you know that's a that's a big question more shaming than everybody else ... here's what's interesting here's what we found\nThere is no denomination that is inherently more shaming however there are congregations\nYou can trace like critical masses of shame as social control not back to a specific religion but back to a specific church while which means\nIt's not the doctrine that how the doctrine is used by by people to gain power and so what I Would say is you can't go to California and find more vulnerable empathetic people and go to Boston and like more guarded heads down it's about the leadership\nAnd an organization\nIt's how the leaders model and protect\nAnd ... human eyes work\nWhat about parts of the world I mean in America we have a very weren't inherently rebellious nation like we're kind of a go your own way do their own thing kind of people but great companies have emerged\nFrom Japan and Germany and all over the world is very different cultural standards that are in the in some ways much more hierarchical much more centralized much less focused on creativity and more focused on\nCompliance yeah how do you square that\nWell we we're not sure and then we hosted a training in London and we had forty people attend representing forty different nations and we went around the room and I said what is the cultural lesson around vulnerability and every single person had a teaching\nThat was embedded in their heart and their families and their workplace like some of the folks from the u._k. said don't get a notion above your station\nYou tight lipped yes stiff upper lip from Holland they said you know the translation is terrible but don't stand taller than all the other poppy\nOr the other ... and the poppy field\nVulnerability is not easy anywhere because all of that armor\nIs protecting the human part of us\nWell it's also protecting our job I mean we got to be able to pay rent\nRight sometimes it's protecting our job but sometimes just getting in a way of our job I mean I think about in my own role as a leader and not just as a professor at Twenty years but as a founder and CEO I Would say\nAnd the lack of grounded competence\nHas been the primary reason\nHas been the number one struggle with employees I'm Sorry grounded confident so we can't just ask people to take\nFarmer often show up make and you can't straight through work right and the whole disclosure over sharing stuff that's not vulnerability that something else but the real ability to show up and leave you know the number one problem is people who don't do vulnerability don't do hard conversations\nThey avoid conflict they don't talk to people when they're upset they talk about people behind their backs so this whole idea that Vognar do you know being vulnerable is going to cost us our job I Would argue that not being vulnerable not being brave\nWill cost you your job\nBecause when you start having the meeting after the meeting because you're afraid to speak out that's toxic in the culture\nWhen you start giving people the dirty yes in the meeting meaning like oh yeah Joshua that sounds like a great idea thanks for sharing and then I get out of the media and say hey make sure you touch with finding out what that stuff happening\nThat isn't not protecting your job\nWhat's protecting your job again if you think phone or ability as disclosure of this is confusing but so what's clear that vulnerability is not disclosure\nIt's the willingness to stay in a hard conversation when it becomes awkward uncomfortable if the willingness to hold somebody accountable instead of blaming them it's the ability to reset after failure and disappointment\nI Wonder if there are certain kinds of companies when we can continue this in a moment but I Wonder if there are certain kinds of companies where it's more appropriate than others one of our listeners tweeted\nIs this person serious is this a joke keep your opinions out at my place of business or you are fired or there's some places a business where that's appropriate we'll get to that and the minute they close [noise]\n\n\nAnd run and infrastructure heavy investment intensive business you got to have a plan I'm making decisions today that'll be
