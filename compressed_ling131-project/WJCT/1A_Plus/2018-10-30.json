A. M. U. and NPR in Washington is one [noise]\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson today we are thrilled to launch a new project one a across America you've helped us change the national conversation taking on big issues from every corner of this country\nNow we're taking that to a new level telling more of your stories right up to the twenty twenty election will begin with a look at who's voting early and how we each party hopes to capitalize then we'll focus on three states for starters Kansas Michigan Colorado and see what's driving voters to the pool\nIf you're in one of those states what's on your mind to head of the election comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one egg [noise]\nThan there are a couple of instances where it appears like the early voting might even match or surpassed that in a presidential year which has twin sixteen and that would be highly unusual because while overall turnout in a presidential year is some lately is somewhere between fifty\nFive and sixty percent turnout in a midterm years is usually hovers more I'm forty percent were speaking to David Barker is the director\nOf the center for congressional and presidential studies at American University\nGlad to hear from some of you as well one a at W. A. M. U. dot org if you did decide to vote early what made you decide to vote early and if not why not do you live in a state\nThat does not allow for early voting was early voting just not for you we're interested to know some of your stories as well you can tweet us at when a comment on our Facebook page or email one at a at W. A. M. U.\nDot org harmony tweeted I voted early in Tennessee I Love being able to vote early it should be across all states\nDavid which states do allow early voting what what kind of access do we see across the country generally speaking\nMost states allow some form of early\nAnd now that is really picked up in the past few cycles over the course of the past decade especially or at a point now where I Believe thirty eight states allow some form of early voting the ones that don't are disproportionally or in the south\nAre and in New England I understand we enough which surprises a lot of people that the ones that do allow early voting though they don't win or not yeah in New England uh for for some reason most of the states that they don't allow it still a\nA couple of a few of the lower population states or in the south like Mississippi and Alabama I'm In Kentucky and then a few states the big states in the mid Atlantic like New York and Pennsylvania\nA Delaware a and then Michigan and in the mid west that's about it really what are some of the factors involved in terms of the states that do or don't allow early voting are there certain common bonds in terms of their rationales for doing it or not doing it [noise]\nI don't think anybody really has a good handle on that I think early on um the perspective was that bluer states tended to allow early voting you know earlier\nThan red states did but but now as as I mentioned there doesn't seem to be much of a rhyme or reason then in that respect with blue states being just as likely to not allowed as as red states\nI think one of the factors as a simple one which is just cost if you have to have especially with with in person early voting if if you have to have people manning polls all throughout the day or for weeks that had an election cycle that costs money and so states that have smaller budgets or can't afford that what about\nOn a partisan level with early voting I mean I remember after\nThe election in two thousand in Florida Democrats were very very serious about making sure not only that people knew about early voting and absentee voting but that they knew what their rights were for example if you are in line when the polls closed do to get out of the line because you are entitled to vote\nHow is the different parties engaged with early voting well\nIn general right it tends to be the Democrats who are more interested as you just alluded to in trying to make sure that the voting is as easy as possible for the for the most number of people and then has to do with a\nDemographic coalition of democratic voters they more likely to be a people of of lesser means more likely to be ethnic and racial minorities\nAnd maybe the most important thing is they're more likely to be young people\nAre and young people traditionally don't vote a nearly the same rates as older people they move around a lot they don't necessarily get registered they don't necessarily think about it\nAnd so it's really really important for Democrats in any election to try to make sure that there are people turn out and so they tend to be more aggressive about expanding the franchise in a righty of ways in early voting is just one of those\nJudy tweeted I early voted so that I can expend my energy now to get others out to vote\nWhat just happened tweeted I live in New York state that does not have early voting I like going to vote on election day but I realize it's hard for some people and I wish my state had early voting I think America needs to make voting as easy as possible so more people will do it\nDavid is there a case to be made for voting early besides you know I mean we heard from Judy why she voted early so she can focus on get out the vote efforts but what what is the case for voting early as opposed to just going on I ...\nMade a lot of people aren't able to go on election day or right especially people who maybe have unusual types of jobs are people who can't just call off of people who can't just take the\nThe day off I may not be remotely a easy for them to vote on election day and so\nUm you know giving people a window to do it I certainly increases turn out and then from abroad democratic small D democratic a point of view that's a good thing that the counter argument to that right is that a campaign takes place over the course of this entire period\nAnd ah so there are things going on right up until election day they could in theory affect people's votes and so when you allow people to vote early maybe they don't take account of all of those things\nThe question from Dwayne who asked a Twitter or early and absentee votes even counted on election day are the only talented if needed\nThat depends so um and in most cases yes they they are there are some places where I get into the really restrictive forms of of absentee voting only in other words though we're the only way that you can vote early is\nAbsentee in with a good excuse a those votes aren't necessarily going to be I counted until later if if it's close or will they will I'm Sorry I should correct myself they will all they will all be counted ripe right but they won't necessarily be counted on election day unless it's close\nUm however with a lot of these other states that they're counting them as they come in on their Web sites that you can go to and you can see the total is being updated regularly\nThere's another one of those reasons on election night to listen carefully to the coverage when they started giving returns because they will tell you state by state you know these are from the polls the early voting hasn't been routed yet there's a Twenty one day period where they double check like it's it's different from place to place\nThat's right and the other thing to to keep in mind and maybe this is one of the questions are going to ask me but uh we expect in most cases especially at this point\nI when you look at the early voting numbers we expect to see a Republican advantage in those numbers a lot of a Web sites have been looking at this and saying oh gee maybe the Democratic wave isn't coming because look the Republican numbers are a little bit stronger than the Democratic numbers but that's where you would expect to see with respect to males votes and the earliest voters\nOne more comment from Sarah who emailed I vote early because it's such a pleasure no line easy parking any time or day I Want just easier all around\nDavid Barker is the director of the center for congressional and presidential studies at American University David thanks for talking to us as you very much coming up we'll take a look at what's driving early voting in different states and will introduce you to

this debate about security in houses of worship is is trending\nWell I don't think there's any question about a judge or just in that example that you reference they only began closing their doors after the in response to the Charleston shooting and I wouldn't be at all surprised\nIf after this attack a on the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh you're going to see even more synagogues posting armed guards outside their building there is no\nAnd there's been actually a a lot also uh in terms of aside from armed guards what else can be done whether it's metal detectors whether it's\nWhether it's a stronger doors are that are close more often I mean there's a lot of debate and discussion right now about beefing up security at all kinds of places of worship that is clearly where the trend is\nBefore we go caffeine tweeted my synagogue in Slovenia Ohio which is near Toledo has had police officers at all or services for as long as I remember we're a target where do we see that the next

now or in what is anti Semitism but I think they're\nYou know it's one thing to just say we did announce anti Semitism but I think it's also important to sort of get into that the mentality that leads to anti Semitism that has a lot to do with\nConspiracy theories it has a lot to do with other rising uh you know people that you don't like I mean it's not just a matter of hating Jews there's a whole way of thinking a mentality that\nSupports anti Semitic think and I think we have to pay a lot more attention to that\nNPR religion and belief correspondent Tom Gjelten Tom thanks for talking to a

Kansas that suburb of Kansas City the goal is to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nUm so I think we're a leader in that and we help other pastors be able to think about this because I have twenty hours a week to work on my sermon advertiser has that so when we're talking about these things many other churches and we formed small group studies out of what we've done uh in the church to help other people think about it so I think the denominations in much the same place that the uh we have\nA a group that speaks for us uh or at least you know spend some analyzing social issues they tend to be a bit more progressive\n'em and you kind of hope for that they're you know you've got people who are pushing the envelope a little bit to ask\nHard questions that many of us might find uncomfortable and then in the end were not bound to agree with what that particular group our church and society uh is is the organization speaking of\nAnd so conservative tend not to like them very much and and others to say you know I I like me I tend to say I'm grateful that the wrestling with these things I may not always agree with him but I'm really grateful for their their work in this so I think we're you know we're\nWe are having these conversations are important conversations unfortunately the thing that we're most divided about right now is that the nomination because we tend to be\nWe tend to be concerned for justice as a as a denomination we are concerned about I mean John Wesley are found her was anti slavery in in areas where it was really hard to be anti slavery in England Bristol, England in particular a you know he was addressing the social issues of his time that's part and parcel of being Methodist\nBut the um the issue that we're divided over most right now is not immigration about which many people would agree you know would find some common ground it's about a human sexuality and so like many of the mainline churches were divided about how we see marriage and whether a same gender marriage is acceptable or not acceptable and and those divisions are largely\nThey're they're often around both age and we find the deep south has one you know as one way of seeing things in the north and east and west another way of seeing things in the church and we're on the verge of probably ... at least a minor division over this and our church\nWill you took up the issue of the inclusion of algae beat the people in the church as something you wanted to deal with more specifically why was that\nYeah well for several reasons one is I felt like we needed as the largest in sort of the leading tricks aren't domination help the rest of the church is\nAt least have the know what the framework is for the conversation but we also have probably eight hundred gay and lesbian people\nOr children of our members who are gay and lesbian and then when I asked the question on Sunday how many of you have a friend or a family member or a co worker that you care about who's gay or lesbian and almost everybody raise their hands\nWe have to talk about this and are denominations policy put in place in Nineteen Seventy two as is a pretty harsh policy and it's it's one that half the nomination in the United states disagrees with and so what a policy\nWell it's a it says that um [noise] ... on the positive side says uh and the word homosexual is what was used in Nineteen Seventy two so homosexual people no less than heterosexual people or people sick were worth before God so okay we all agree on that\nBut the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching so that's the phrase and then pastors are not allowed to officiate same gender marriages in our ... on any of our properties or actually\nYou know I met this past weekend officiate anywhere we cannot officiate and so you have communities where you have a significant gay and lesbian presence and and you have a church saying what you do\nIs incompatible Christian teaching who in essence it sort of goes along with who you are and we will not be you know we cannot be a ministry with you in this way now our churches are generally welcoming so most of our church said we want you we care about you but this is our policy but it doesn't feel very welcoming when you're told that you and your spouse are incompatible\nWith Christian teaching well I Wonder how you respond to members of the church who are more conservative who say well wait a minute\nJesus said I didn't come to make peace I came with a sword game to divide you know that there are parts of the scripture [noise]\nThat are not flexible Jesus said I'm the way and the truth from the life and no one comes through the father butts by me and there are certain parts of the scripture that are welcoming and there are certain parts of the strip scripture that are strict on purpose and there's a point at which we as Christians have to be able to say look\nI Love you but this is what the Bible says and I can't count to reveal the word of God how do you reconcile that\nYou know I think that's exactly right but part of what I've tried to teach our people is a is what is the scripture and how was it formed because if you if you say that so this is what you often hear from people it's the word of God and now you're messing with the word of God you're picking and choosing\nAnd uh and and part of what I'd say is picking and choosing is actually called interpreting and the scriptures need to be interpreted because they were you know they are sacred text but they were written by human beings we believe they're inspired by God but we don't really know exactly how that inspiration work\nThey were written by human beings in particular cultures and historical circumstances so there's two hundred and Seventy plus versus in the Bible that affirming allow slavery including beating her slave with rods as long as they don't die within two days because the slaves were property that's what it says and access\nSo we look at those passages go yeah no not that ah that there are other passages that over the overshadow those but two hundred and Seventy plus of these are six passages about gay and lesbian actually six passages about some form of St John gender relationship one of which calls for you to kill gay men\nAnd nobody I Know is killing gay men were advocating for that even though that's what the Bible says and so there's a place for us to go in there was a preacher once uh I was talking about this um I'd written a book called making sense the Bible and I was on a national lecture on this and then he said you know you're just picking and choosing and I said well let me just ask you a question\nDo you have a pension fund and Methodist preachers love their pension fund you know do you have a pension fund well yeah of course I said let me ask you this what part of Jesus words don't store it for yourself treasures on earth did you not understand\nBecause that's pretty clear passage and yet you've somehow managed to say no we need pension funds to even though Jesus said about the structure she's on her and what you did as you interpreted so you could say you're picking and choosing or you could say you're interpreting\nHow did he had he was five sure he didn't liquidate his pension fund about he was such a silent [laughter]\nAnd you know I I like they're not telling people not to have a four one K. you know I'm not OK I'm saying\nI'm saying that we need to be able to take our secret tax and we need to understand the times in which was written and we need to recognize you know again let the women keeps falling in the church has a women with their heads covered there's a whole lot of these passages where we don't\nObserver those things in the same way today and we recognize that these words came within a particular culture in context and we've got it and so we inform our scripture reading we interpret the scripture in the light of our experience in the light of the tradition of the church and the light of reason those things help us to be able to make sense and that's how it always worked\nPastor Adam Hamilton of the church of the ...\nShouldn't near Kansas City Kansas we spoke this summer for the Aspen Ideas to go pod cast we'll wrap up our conversation and
