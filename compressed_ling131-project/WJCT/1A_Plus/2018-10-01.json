season you may recall a easy win over the jets by and large the thirty one to twelve that this was not\nThe most satisfying thirty one to twelve victory you've ever seen for a number of reasons why there were some very good things for sure yesterday oblique Wardle set a career high with three hundred eighty passing yards\nHe was razor sharp especially early completed his first eleven passes and the owners twelve there was an incomplete pass made a great decision he was under pressure through them all the way a Andrew instead of losing twelve or fourteen yours on a sec\nOr they went back to the second in ten they wanted to first down and go on to score touched down on that drive so very good play there and a very good day for ... two receivers had a hundred yards receding Didi Westbrook nine catches\nFor a hundred and thirty ... five kids just run for nine including a sixty Seventy yard touchdown both career days with the jaguars for those two players and the refunds held the jets

for the first time since your dreams hamstring in the opener now looks like he's going to probably be again on the foreign ... watch for the next several weeks and\nAs I mentioned ... after the game not particularly impressed with what was a fairly dominant when\nObviously it's a whim and all of a show called off to finish the quarter which was our goal of three in one or able to do that obviously we had a penalty is mia turnovers um those are the things I told him that if we keep continue to play like that that's going to get us in trouble or we weren't able to come back and win a game\nI think what this tells us is that the expectations not only externally but internally are very very high for the jaguars when you win the game by you don't mind my Nineteen point dinner never

point it's about how the team play and he's right\nWhen they start playing better competition competition better than the jets or things like the mind history and the turnover margin and committing almost a hundred yards with the penalties can cost you a game and that could happen\nThis week because they have a very tough test against uh right now undefeated Kansas City chiefs play tonight I guess the\nIt was a Monday Night football but they have to go to Kansas City arrowhead stadium which is one of the most difficult places to play traditionally the national football league at such a

A. M. U. and NPR in Washington DC is one a [noise]\nA there I'm Joshua Johnson today on one age that Kavanaugh's confirmation the FBI is investigating claims that the judge sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers it's the result of a bipartisan deal the climax of too dramatic days at a Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd it's got the nation talking about the Supreme Court sexual assault and the lives of women in America will get some analysis and we'd love to hear from you so Hollis eight five five to three six one a one a email won a a W am you've got or comments on our Facebook page or tweet us ... one egg [noise]\nIs ... that like what's your what's your core coral was Senator Feinstein was was\nKind of what she did you know because she says that she did contact professor Ford and say look you know if it's purely an unnamed allegation there's nothing I can do it sounds like you would have preferred instead of that being a spur to testify openly for a different kind of private process were from there it would have gone to the FBI\nAbsolutely because she did turn it over to the FBI she just did it in September after the hearings rover instead of in July when it could've been done without turning it into a public spectacle\nProfessor Rosen what do you think about professional sports testimony in terms of what impact that would have on the ultimate outcome whether it changes anyone's mind for example about ... capital I feel like in a way it kind of gave people more ammunition to deepen their perspectives on whether Brett Kavanaugh should or should not be on the Supreme Court\nWill you saw ensure that the polls over the weekend which suggested that the ultimate ah support for Brett Kavanaugh didn't much change after this phase his supporters dug in their heels as did his opponents are and ah this is consistent with that recent study that suggests that highly polarized people who hear arguments on the other\nSide are likely to become more committed to their initial position not less although passions have definitely reason and the future institutional legitimacy of both the Senate and the Supreme Court is very much in play the the ultimate outcome may not be altered\nWhat about the way a Professor Rosen about that judge Kavanaugh imported himself I mean he was\nHe's been much lampooned for his behavior including the cold open a Saturday Night live forty fourth season debut this past weekend were Matt Damon played him or in the open to the show a number of people are saying that it didn't help his case on the other hand others have said if I'd been accused of what he was accused of I'd be pretty ticked off to\nA you're absolutely right those are the reactions and you know just speaking descriptive lead there are ... even the conservative\nSide um there there have been commentators who said that I think he was unfairly treated these allegations are outrageous it's understandable that someone would react that way with\nA allegations he believes to be false nevertheless that was not a judicious a statement and it calls into would call into question his nonpartisan neutrality on the bench and as a result Democrats like Henry Waxman in the house are already saying if he is confirmed we plan to have impeachment\nProceedings both to find out what happened and also about his temperament it's really fascinating because one Supreme Court impeachment in history as Justice Samuel chase was over his alleged judicial temperament he gave her rings against Republicans from the bench\nTo Justice Marshall testified for him he was narrowly acquitted in the Senate and that came to stand for the proposition that you can't compete someone because of their temperament of 'cause you don't think that their traditions but only for an actual crime\nWe are speaking to Jeffrey Rosen president and CEO of the national constitution center and a law professor at the George Washington university also speaking to professor Brian Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt law school and a former clerk\nTo delete Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\nGlad to get your questions and thoughts as well email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one a or comment on our Facebook page especially if the lines are jammed up but we always welcome your calls and emails at eight five five to three six one a one a professor fitzpatrick I'd like to put the temperament question to you\nAs well partly because that's part of what our audiences reacting to Helene tweeted\nAfter witnessing Brett Kavanaugh's indignant rant toward Democrats in his statement it proves to me that he is incapable of bipartisanship dust unfit for a SCOTUS Supreme Court of the United states' position what do you think\nI think it was a very unusual tactic to deploy but I Do think that he had to show some indignation if these allegations are false says he says they are\nTo just sit there and calmly refute them I don't think would have been as persuasive\nTo people he tried to calm route as we know on Fox News last Monday Night and it didn't go over very well I think it went over better this time I Will say though\nEven though his opening statement I thought was pretty strong except for reference to the Clintons which I thought it was totally unnecessary his queuing day with the senators did not go so well I think he was very defensive\nAnd not very mature frankly and how he handled himself and so I I give them a mixed review\nI Wonder in a way if it even matter though a union in terms of the confirmation I mean I think back to Clarence Thomas's hearing regarding the Anita Hill allegations which CSPAN ran I think was the day before the Kavanaugh Ford hearing which was very instructive because you know Clarence Thomas was not calm in\nTerms of the way he responded to any of the hill I mean he used the word lynching twice he called it a high tech lynching and he said I'm not going to give you the wrote to Lynch me with not to hang me with to Lynch me with\nShe where they asked him did you hear professor Hill's testimony said no I'm not ... I'm not going to listen to lives and yet he was confirmed I Wonder in the scheme of things professor for Patrick how much temperament really matters history would suggest that at the end of the day it's a piece but it may not be that big a deal\nBut I think you hit the nail on the head earlier when you said that it doesn't really change anyone's mind what goes on in these hearings everyone looks at it\nThrough a partisan lens and you know academics have studied something called implicit bias which tries to get at the prejudices that we have against other people that may not be explicit prejudices or or or uh things that are very um explicit in our minds\nAnd what they have found when they do these studies is that people have more prejudice\nAgainst people who have different political views than they do than people who are different races or genders than they are so political I'm bias is a very serious\nMatter and and so I think when all of us look at these hearings we just see things through our political sphere rather than maybe being neutral observers\nI Want to follow up with you on that will we continue particularly whether or not judge Kavanaugh will be able if he becomes justice Kavanaugh\nTo do the business of the Supreme Court outside a partisan lens because there are other journalists you know John Roberts among them who have made decisions that conservatives didn't dig the Obamacare decision for example and I kind of would like to get your sense of that professor for its Patrick when we come back we also want to talk about the FBI investigation many of you were asking about that like Peggy\nPeggy emailed if the FBI does not find any evidence to support Dr Ford's testimony\nAnd if it does not find any evidence that judge Kavanaugh has lied but he is not confirmed\nWill he be able to keep the job he currently has\nGood question he's currently on the D.C court of appeals will put that question to Brian Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt Jeffrey Rosen of the George Washington university law school and the national constitution center will bring in one more guest for the con from conversation and we'll get to some of your calls as well I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a firm W.

I saw the testimony and the news as all saying he's guilty I said what if the FBI comes back\nAnd says there's no substantial evidence that she goes well he's still guilty and it's made me think no matter what even if the F ... says no substantial evidence that could find this gentleman is going to be seen guilty in the eyes of many for the rest of his life it's always going to follow him the days of innocent until proven guilty are gone\nWhat do you think that is just like you did you have any sense of why they were so dug in about his guilt\n[noise] I I kept you know I I tried to get it out of them if it gets thing is we saw the testimony and all the news channels saying he looks guilty and I I I don't want to blame the media you know I don't want to say oh fake news or\n[noise] but ... it's\nGot to be ... it's got to be the mentality I mean these were younger um employs probably early twenties at the most and it's just and I I I couldn't get over it that they've already thrown him in jail and their eyes and even you know when I asked them if they found no evidence I say still gonna be guilty as far as they're concerned\nYou know and it's it's just sad that's like that's\nJoshua appreciates Conan thanks very much and professor it's about are the kind of get to this idea of being tried in the in the court of public opinion\n[noise] yes and you know like I said earlier I think people tend to view these things through that their own political prior commitments and if you're a liberal you look at it and say he's guilty if you're conservative you look at it and you say he's innocent\nBut I Do think you raised a very important question about what the evidence Sherry standard needs to be here and it has to be something\nThat is significant enough that we do not creative process where any time someone has nominated some person can come out of nowhere and say this happened to me forty years ago\nAnd if it can't be disproved then the nominee is rejected because then you'll see people come out of the woodwork for every nominee and I don't think we want to create that kind of process so I think we have to ask for some kind of corroboration before we deny this person his position on the court\nWhen you throw a few more of your comments see us in ironclad posted on our website the one eight dot org hopefully the FBI will investigate Ford story too and the ... she has to Democrats and if she lied and why she's withholding her notes and therapists records\nConstance emailed the Kavanaugh hearing is not about political party it's about class when I was growing up in the middle class Republican household in flyover country we knew that the rich kids could get away with stuff that would have landed us in juvenile court or worse\nWe also know that because of their wealth and position these same kids would still be the leaders of our city and our state when they grew up with all their past sins forgiven it's depressing to see that nothing has changed rich kids can misbehave abominable when they're young and still lined up on the Supreme Court\nRob posted on our won a Facebook page I was very happy with flakes decision preparing to Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona and it gives the country and Senate time to breathe any Democrat who wants the FBI investigation to be longer\nCan now be fully accused of parties and delay since and flakes decision was bipartisan the FBI got hills investigation referring to Anita Hill done in four days so this should be wrapped up by friday\nSenator Flake and senator Coons of Delaware a democratic senator both spoke on sixty minutes in an interview that aired yesterday Scott Kelly asked a question to Senator Flake\nThat provoked a very telling answer\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running no [laughter] no not yet not a chance to show no because politics has become too sharp to ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there is no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nPart of the interview that Senator Flake gave Scott Kelly on sixty minutes yesterday as Elizabeth that's a that is telling it's kind of kind of sad but at the end of the day it works like that part of the bipartisanship it's a set of this supposed to include work the way it was kind of suppose do\nYes I mean let's help sell uh actually I I Would hope that Senator Flake would be disturbed by the news that the investigation might be severely hamstring by the White House as a\nParent there is some dispute on this but as a parent direction that the FBI limited as to when they interview and and those limitations make it far\nLess of an investigation and more of a foregone conclusion and but I I think that that shows that well the political lens governs when it comes to\nOur elected leaders and fortunately and I think that that professor ... there's actually a little bit of wrong when he thinks that that's true for the entire nation I think that uh the person who called in about the folks that he was overhearing at dinner believing a Dr Ford you know\nThey believe are because they saw her and because they know from personal experiences of themselves or their loved ones that people don't come forward until they have to and to see her emotion and our credibility within heavily

W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at when a or comment on our Facebook page Chris Brown one particular kind of law we wanted to touch on\nIs what's come to be known as extreme risk laws or red flag laws eight states have passed red flag laws recently give us a sense of what these laws are and how effective you think that could be\nSure so extreme risk laws are laws that allow law enforcement a family member or in some a specific states a few cases\nUm loved ones too and the community to petition for temporary order removing access to firearms from at risk individuals\nAnd that these kinds of laws have been in effect in some states for a long time\nNotably in Connecticut\nUm they've had a long experience with these laws and and what they found is that they can have a profound effect and a a removing guns from at risk individuals and then the\nGetting the kind of treatment and help some of these individuals so desperately need but often don't get in order to address the at risk behavior at south\nNow I I Will say in response to to Richard I completely agree with you on the American public\nOr does not want guns in the hands of dangerous or at risk people\nThe frustrating thing is that while eight states had an act that these measures posts Parkland and and I think that's a really important point to know\nThe n._r._a. at almost every step\nHas opposed the enactment of these measures and they do it on the spurious arguments\nThat somehow this will deny people due process I Want to note for your viewers that in every instance every state has passed these laws that allow a hearing before a court where the individuals who subject to the order\nCan raise any issue an argument for why it should not apply to them and not as across the board the case in every state that has now adopted days I can save life\nI didn't want to talk more about the impact will be on a rabid Richard let me give you a chance to jumping briefly before we have to pause\nYou know everything that we do in life is really all about balance and when we're balancing the risk to the public\nFor someone who's gone off the edge we just have to be careful about what we're not doing\nIs using an excuse or allowing someone to get even with someone else and uh we do a good job this is a fair a risk that we should take and I support in principle the red flag loss\nWill continue our conversation with Richard Feldman of independent firearm owners association Chris Brown of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence and Scott Greenberg state line in just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson glad to be with you you're listening to one a firm W.

proposals part one of our new series the state we're in\nWe're speaking to Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line Chris Brown the co president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence and Richard Feldman president of the independent firearm owners association we love to hear from you too sure what you know about new gun laws in your state or proposals in your state whether they are in the state house or on the ballot\nYou probably have heard of these but these are laws\nThat say that you have a presumption of legal authority to stand your ground with a firearm if you were attacked in any place that you would otherwise have the legal right to be your home a public place that you are allowed to use deadly force in that location and you do not have a responsibility\nTo flee course brought I Wonder how you would respond to that clip we heard of Governor Scott being heckled\nAt the Vermont state ... state house it just seems like the emotions are so high and so hot that there was no way in some states among some folks to come up with anything reasonable with anything bipartisan any idea is going to be met with a flat out vehement loud no\nWell there as Richard now that I I agree with what he said the politics of this issue can often seem to transcend the policy of this issue and that doesn't serve anyone's interest while\nWhat we find around our issue is a polarization um but mainly as perception and there are certain people who believe and this is really shield by the the NRA and its rhetoric around us I think more than anything else that any regulation\nOf guns means it's a slippery slope to taking guns away in this country and it's simply not correct from the very beginnings of our country\nAnd we had regulations in place around the gun ownership\nAnd you know there are references made to the wild west and what that was like well actually most of those towns you had to check your guns before you even entered the town right there is a rich history and heritage and this that I think\nAmong a certain subset of people get that gets distorted but you know I go out and talk about this issue all the time and I have to say\nMost of the responses I get an audience says that have guns and many that don't\nFrom gun owners is I agree with you I stand with you and I agree with Richard I think the n._r._a. is really boxing at south into an unfortunate corner on this issue and it's not consistent with what the vast majority of Americans think should happen\nI think I think it's also interesting to note that uh when you talk about the politics overcoming the policy of it that things are so polarized in Congress at the federal level in Washington that it seems like we're we're very far away from having the kind of a\nDiscussion on practical solutions that we're having in the states I mean Hogan is a Republican Scott's a Republican you have in the states the ability for Democrats and Republicans to come together on some solutions\nI'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one day\nWe should know by the way to today's program was produced in partnership with guns and America a new public media reporting project on the role of guns in American Life you can find out more about this project online at guns and America dot org by the way Scott before we move on from bump stocks remind us\nHow states did with bump stocks which ones banned them which one is allowed the what's the national picture look like\nSo uh as we noted earlier the bump stock that are really people began to hear about that after Las Vegas and uh since then we now have we've seen ten states\nThat have banned bumps stocks um\nIt's a fairly easy thing to do I think because uh it's not something\nIt's not going to affect a hunters are most a gun owners or however there are concerns about just how effective this might be and in states that have passed it a lot of questions for example you outlaw bump stocks and you're basically saying if you have when you got to turn it in and\nAnd places that have passed this we've written about this uh people are not turning them and so some question about the effectiveness but\nWell then there's also the slippery slope argument that has come up with bump stocks I mean\nNPR's MORNING EDITION interviewed Michael Hammond last week he's the legislative counsel for a group called gun owners of America which is basically against all gun control the group is not the end or a it's a separate group but it takes similar stances against gun legislation that restricts\nAccess to firearms in that interview with MORNING EDITION Michael Hammond says she worried about way bump stocks ban could lead to\nOur question is whether or not this effort to go at the back door and ban semi automatic a by regulation\nRichard Shelby what do you make a Michael's argument\nWind I Know Michael a long time and I think what he's trying to say he is that\nBump stocks has nothing to do with a a semi automatic he allows as you correctly identified it earlier in the show the kinetic energy of the firing a gun\nTo allow it to essentially go up against your finger and fire another round but without a bump stock I can do exactly the same thing with my finger it doesn't make a semi automatic an automatic um\nIt's still very wait wait wait wait a minute you can you really do exactly the same thing with your finger I mean having that degree of kinetic energy as opposed to having to rely on your own reaction time your ability of your index finger to go flicks looks looks looks looks like that is not the same\nIt's exactly the same thing I think you're inside the trigger guard I can um fire that gun just as quickly okay I'm\n... and ... and ... you know\nAgain this is one of those issues that well let's just ban it I mean if there was a terrorist incident involving a red Ford and we said well let's ban red Ford's it's true that over time that won't be read for us on the street so terrorists couldn't get a read for it and go into people\nThat's a very serious argument Michael red forwards or not designed to do mass amounts of damage I think that's kind that's less than apples and oranges are ... and I'm I'm ... I'm Sorry I I presume that you and I are of different generations I don't think that someone\nWho is a twenty two year old a ceiling versus someone who is you know in their fifties or sixties or seventies both on with firearms have equal capacity to flip their index finger at the same rate there or not to say\nIt all depends on your training but there's not much\nTraining involved in using your finger inside a trigger God his going back and forth again this is feel good legislation and it really had nothing to do it was a reaction\nIf it was used in the gun much than it is the same number of people who had been injured but without the use no one would be talking about banning that device\nThere are other kinds of devices that have come up in some of this legislation drew in Pittsburgh tweeted we have smartphones which can open with face recognition or fingerprints why can't we apply the same tech to firearms whole no solution is perfect although they'll know solution is perfect I Would think it will help curb the issue\nThere are some laws to propose doing things very similar to that we'll talk about that and more in just a moment because\n[noise]\nThe c._e._o. of the biggest bank in the United states wants more than just a business\nPlan not about the models of credit\nI always told them if you're going to all the models you want a character in culture if this isn't a model\nI name he's got that conversation with Jamie diamond the c._e._o. and J.
