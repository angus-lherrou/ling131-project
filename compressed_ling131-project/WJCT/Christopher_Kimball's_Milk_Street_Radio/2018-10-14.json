T. up in Jacksonville your community your world\n\n... radio I'm your host Christopher Kimball today journalist Krissy Clark joins me to talk about the checkered history of peanut butter\nHow ... was adulterous to increase profits and the massive legal fight that ensued about how to define how much peanut butter had to be in the jar to call it peanut butter [noise] being greedy and in question that I think raised I mean a lot of alarm bells ones and\nChris go some folks described it as it was a tantamount to\nPeanut flavored cold cream\nWith peanut butter when\nWe also hear from reporter machine sheeley to visit the bus station tells you to discover Filipino delicacies I head over to most streets kitchen to make a bright aromatic guilt would be hurry explain how would wider spices at home and of course we hear from\nRegular contributor Dr ailing Carol I'm Christian ... radio from Iraq coming up after the news\n... he's the only one year old and I came here\nTo finally find many [noise]\nSo is this something at the bus station just started or it's been going on for ten years or what\nIt's been going on for years and it's become sort of the main area where Filipinos come to congregate I spoke with two women Jeanette and Bailey and they told me that the reason they come to eat this food here in the bus station\nIs because they live with their employers and their employers keep kosher so they can't cook pork in there and players homes and a lot of Filipino food is pork here's Bailey\nNeck I Love it and then because the the million dollars in London\nAnd and also it's so bad then [noise]\nSo that's why the outside media or\nThen there's ... she works in ... which is about an hour north of Tel Aviv she's thirty eight years old she's been in Israel for ten years she came to Israel to work as a ... or ... she when I spoke to her she was eating not me which is\nIt was described to me as sort of [noise] actually it was described to me in Hebrew as Mara or as which means like soup with race it sort of like a chicken soup convert soup and she says when she comes to the fourth floor of the bus station she feels like she's ... at home in the Philippines\nBecause see they grew up in front of the things we know the pain\nSo this is a a bus station that has been transformed into a community center at the very least or it may be something even more than that so ... so what what's the bigger meaning here it's not just food is not just companionship it's about a culture within a culture right\nYeah and I think you find this in America is sinus all over the world where people\nAre living in a place that's really far away from home really far away from ... really far away from family to me it's really incredible the way that people come together and build that for themselves and I think that's what's happened inside the bus station\n... thank you so much a\nGreat story or it makes me want to go to the fourth floor of a bus station Tel Aviv thank you thank you so much\nThat was reporter and producer Sheena she'll and\nYou can subscribe to listen to the radio anytime podcast new shows are available every Friday and I do or wherever you download the podcast please subscribing get all of our show downloaded automatically right to your phone\nRight now my ... and I will be some of your calls Sarah is of course the storm service weeknight meals on public television as well as all through the book home cooking one on one [noise]\nSarah are you ready to go Chris I'm great and I'm ready to go welcome to mount St who's calling\nHi this is Fred and Fred Hi Brett how can we help you today\nYeah I had a question regarding ingredients that are called to be graded and recipes a lot of times it calls for things like onions or gender and it releases a lot of juices and I didn't know whether to include those juices or not because I kind of\nAssume that's where all the flavors but at a lot of times those are also called for quick cooking methods so it didn't really make sense\nYeah you mean if you're trying to brown at what told that liquid doing in their\nRight exactly what kind of recipes are you making what nationality\nA couple or Italian but a lot of times it's with ginger a lot of moisture comes out and stuff like stir fries that sort of thing\nWell first of all ginger and also great incest by the way 'cause you get the essential oils\nYou definitely don't want to throw that out and uh there's a little gadget called the kitchen I. Q. ginger greater which I Love it's a little plastic thing costs Fifteen or twenty bucks a integrates ... what what does it look like Chris ... green plastic it's like an oval shape looks maybe five or six inches wide\nAnd has a little drawer the pulls out oh really you capture all the Jews and the great uh ginger and that's really great what's it called it's called kitchen I. Q. ginger great okay now works great onions\nI think when you die or chop onions there's so little liquid being given off persist the volume of onions I don't think that's just the guy talking about some recipe said a great at oh integrated sure you can gray right over\nThe bowl or right over the pan or wherever it's going I Would use food that liquid as long as you're not going to be watering down whatever you're doing like addressing but\nIf your heating it cooking skill it yes it will be fine absolutely I'm not sure that well last year no onion juice would have a lot of flavor we've actually use that for a cure for salmon and fish sometimes onion juice I could see it in ... I Would think it'd be fun there's pastes and a lot of\nCuisines where you make a paste it's a wet paste and then you go ahead and saute it\nWay saving yeah they mean by the way I said with a orange or women or line zest don't do that over the cutting board cause the essential oils end up on the cutting board and that's where a lot of the flavors so makes or you just right over the bowl\nWherever you are greedy and they're going to go use a micro point test or whatever do the right over the bowl and you won't lose those essential oils okay\nAwesome that sounds great yeah usually use a micro plaintiff for ginger and that just kind of make the pope be\nNo no that doesn't work no they'll definitely have to look into that\nYeah that's that's definitely the better way to do it okay great there you go thank you for going All right thanks ... thank you so much but welcome to mistreat who's calling\nThis is like airport in New York how can we help you\nWell I'm calling with a question about ... custard high tech high yeah and then getting the heights except that hurt so\nI've had to learn that that kind of interesting I haven't quite gotten target for I don't think right on the timing right at it or to see that and turning it once solid math\nWhile I only have about fifty questions [laughter] no I don't really like the most difficult thing it's baking blood sugar plus eggs plus Terry so what are we talking about just a basic Custer pie or a particular kind\nThis is a cranberry chest high orange zest and that is to cop says cranberries and apply um and then it got eggs and butter milk and butter\nIt just has set properly\nI Would say that three quarters of the top of the pilots solid had that really luxurious silky custard at the bottom for like a quarter inch second it was like for one minute to the next in line from ... chill concretely set an over ...\nLet me ask a question did you take the pie out when the center was still juggling\nNo instructions says that's higher than when the top is slightly cost and it turned like golden\nBrown know what you need to do with any custard pie I think might help is the center\n... or so it should still juggle because there's a lot of retain heat and carry over cooking once it comes out of the oven\nIf you want the perfect temperature wind cooled the center has to be under cooked and it will finish cooking outside of the oven if you wait to accustom ... totally set this often happens with a cheesecake outcomes cheesecake it happens it happens with ... other things\nYou really have to under bake the center mission juggle okay and then just tickles side with a holding onto an oven Mitt and then\nOver the next Fifteen or twenty minutes we'll set up properly but that will help the other thing you have to pay check his course Robin temperature but you know\nYou waited till I was fully set which means it will be overcooked by the time it comes out Sarah I'm no I agree I agree I think Chris you're probably right quick question how many eggs and how much buttermilk how much sugar\nThree large eggs in one cup of that or not I didn't decrease the sugar a little bit I took\nThat reason alone or cop and a quarter and I know a little bit less than I thought it was great but I'm also wondering how much this airplane to\nThis is how ... what happens on a college so I just everything's fine to about five minutes of it all and what happened I cooked it over my barbecue ... actually around this that if it another\nWell you're right sugar is high gross carpet attracts moisture it has a huge effect on somebody like a custard pie\nBecause the chemistry so go back and use the original amounts and take it out when did you go to the center if that works then you know you solve that problem now the question is how much sugar you can take out a especially with the cranberries I Would think that could be a problem you might have to add an extra egg that's a very delicate chemistry\nAll right well I Will certainly try that said thank you both so much for your insight I see what happens\nNow ... thank you Bye bye this is mostly radio I'm Christopher ...\nWell if you have a cooking failure a complaint or if you just want to try to stump us give us a call that number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eight five five four to six Ninety four three or email us that questions and milk street radio dot com welcome to milk straight who's calling\nWives Ryan I live and Logan, Ohio\nHi Ryan what is your question today\nWell my question is about a month and next to ... a week or of our own field corn last year wow it was fun so we were trying to make a whole and we did not a I guess it's\nThe beginning was a good point because you can't make much money selling commodity products right but you can you can make money if you have a patented branded product that has a secret formula like coke or Kentucky Fried chicken right I mean that's the whole point of this as it adds value makes it harder for people to compete against you you can charge for money\nRight well and for just a consumer might see putting a lot of uh Chris go into peanut butter as\nAn adult to ration but for ... this was um this was an innovation and this was their competitive advantage because there was this age old issue that peanut butter has right of it sticks to the roof of your mouth [laughter]\nIt's really hard to stir or if you have the old fashioned kind and for peanut butter sellers they kind of saw this as this on\nThis road block that was keeping peanut butter from becoming as popular as it could be because it took\nIt took effort to have to figure out how to keep it spread a bowl or it would go rancid quickly so when hydrogenated oils and partially hydrogenated oils came on the scene there was this sense that they could make a smoother more spread all product and people seem to really liked that\nLet's play a clip from the series here\nNever be on your own mind [noise] one guy and [noise]\nSo here's something interesting you know the food safety act Nineteen oh six uh there was arsenic and hard candies ... sulfate and pickles the turn of green ... lots of things\nSo that happened in the beginning of the twentieth century you know half a century later we seem to be going through this whole thing again is that because of the advances in chemistry and science\nWe're now instead of just adding ... to make pickles green people could do much more interesting things to create much more profitable\nProduct yeah I was just reading about these looming sites at the FDA over the definitions of other foods like meet what actually is meat\nAs we've been reading about those articles of a you know that now you can make ... based out of plant writes rewrite plant based meat more humane meet\nWell I think there are so are there are some folks meat producers were like wait a minute don't call that meat like you can you can make it but that's not meet 'em that so yeah we ... we think of this in some ways as these\nThese new fights that are happening because of innovation that's happening right now but every moment in history there's been some sort of innovation and people have been grappling with this since the fifties and before\nSo this is a fight we're just going to continue to have a good science muddy the definition between what is meeting what our eggs and that was something nobody had to fight about fifty years ago right there was no choice right\nRight yeah so we keep coming up with new ways and it's a balancing sort of innovation with precaution\nSo in the peanut butter wars Ruth does have been and the federation of homemakers wanted the FDA to set a standard that peanut butter contains Ninety five percent peanuts in the end the standard was set a Ninety percent right let's play a short clip from the end of your series were Ruth's call for caution regarding food additives resonates in a very real way\nIn the last few years skippy and just have phased out partially hydrogenated oil because as Kevin Myers of skippy explained to me\nPartially hydrogenated oil has some level of\nTrans fat trans fats are are implicated in artery potential artery clogging\nArtery clogging that's linked to heart disease\nSo switching away from the virtually hydrogenated\nEliminating the trench that possibility in the product was very important\nI ask Kevin if he thinks in retrospect maybe the higher standard but that risk Desmond and the FDA had originally called for the Ninety five percent peanuts would have been better so that the amount of partially hydrogenated oil and trans fats would have been limited and peanut butter long ago\nWas giving a twenty twenty hindsight of what has happened over the years the limiting those to at least the lower level probably would've been a good approach to it at that point in time you know\nOf course we've Desmond point was let's not wait for twenty twenty hindsight let's err on the side of precaution to begin with [noise] [noise]\nSo as the FDA's approach to this changed since then you think or they're doing the same dance between the lobbyists when the FDA\nI think the dance continues and consumers have gotten a lot more\nVocal I think Ruth Desmond what was what was so cool about the peanut butter grandma is uh that she was ... one of the first examples of really I just sort of a an everyday consumer she wasn't a lawyer she wasn't someone who was was trained to do this but who\nStarted to pay attention and do her research and get really engaged in this process and wanted to carve out a space for the everyday consumer his voice here's ... daughter Janet again\nThe others would sit quietly they didn't talk mother did all the talking but they would sit there and I agree with everything and and look very elegant and grandmother lay\nAnd when the industry lawyers said something particularly in regime to the homemakers ladies would give them the look we\nUsed to call it the Harry eyeball I'm at ... at proper intervals yes\nAnd what happened to roof does when the peanut butter grandma did she go on and ah continue this life of consumer action\nShe went on to talk about different additives and baby food and ah various hormones that were put in and meets she was a lifelong consumer advocate and she died in her eighties and I think she was fighting up until the end ...\nThank you so much a that's a\nWell it is not an unusual story but it's a good reminder that some things never change thinking so much\nKrissy Clark senior wealth and poverty correspondent marketplace or series on the peanut butter wars was uh\nThey produced for the uncertain our a podcast she hopes for mark ...\nYou know there's nothing new about adultery\nFrom ... sulfate and pickles bright green color to using ... as a preservative\nFood manufacturers have long adultery foods to increase profits but in today's era there is a twist and ... for example wants the FDA due to find an egg as an egg now does some process version of a can so finally the food at a restaurant industry you see the profit motive\nIn selling pure natural foods so it's a\nBit early to declare victory\nBut at least one restaurant chain is acting like a good egg [noise]\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen most street to chat with when Clark about this week's recipes when our him I'm great Chris not too long ago we had a couple on our radio show me ruined village or they have a restaurant in Vancouver called the Jews they've had it for many years and we enjoy the interview so much we actually went there\nTo cook with them and one of the things we loved his or yellow split pea curry we brought the recipe back here and are you did some work with it\nSo this is a great week night meal it takes only about an hour a lot of that his hands off time not allowed to ... to it has two components we're going to simmer some yellow split peas in water with ... salt and ... and then the other part is the base of the curry which is the muscle\nAnd muscle is just a bunch of spices essentially\nThat's right so in this case we start with onions are near uh really stressed the importance of the onions here and we cook them for about Fifteen minutes until their golden brown so that really adds a lot of sweetness to the dish I mean he's a combination of fresh\nWhole faces and grounds faces here so fresh cilantro stands and ginger whole human coriander and yellow mustard seeds and then ... and that just gets cooked together for about thirty seconds till you can kind of smell those spaces\n[noise] no I Love about this is that here in America vegetables legumes are kind of bland they weren't like the centerpiece all you have to do is look to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this is as good as eating a steak I mean it has a tremendous amount of flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of NATO at the end I\nAdd those yellow split keys to the dish those are really thick and creamy you serve it over rice with a cucumber pickles and yogurt you can um as they do in vicious restaurant they add a fried egg on the top to make it kind of a more complete meal that really this is so flavorful and feeling that you you don't really need the\nFight is going to go on everything and about five years so yellow split the curry is a main course dish for Tuesday night thank you when You're welcome ... ...\n\n... you're listening to milk street radio coming up more of your color
