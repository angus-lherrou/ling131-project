S. that you know is really at the heart of Houston dining for a while so I think will start to see more things like that happening\nMegan thank you so much I really enjoyed your article the myth of authenticity killing Tex Mex and the conversation as well thank you\nThat was journalist making the caring\n\nDoes your radio is also available as a podcast subscribe enlisted in the\nNew shows go up every Friday podcast Google Play tune in to modify\nDecided to take your phone or a question from my co hosts are most\nSerious of course the store ... weeknight meals on public television also author of home\nCooking on what\nSarah okay you're ready for some more calls yes you bet welcome to milk street who's on the line\nHi this is eighty eighty where you calling from Sanibel Island Florida ooh lovely how can we help you today\nI wrote in about getting a really good ... the I Can't get it to turn up the way it does in the restaurants you know when it's really good it missing something all of the recipes that I researched online are very similar it's missing something and I don't know what I feel like there's a secret\nHow are you cooking the egg plant\nI cut the eggplants and a half brush with a little bit of oil and then I put them on a baking stones like a cookie sheet type of baking stone in the oven for about a twenty thirty minutes\nHigh heat are nice and soft ... yes\nSome of my editors have when they were in the middle east watch people cook eggplant and they cook it right over a flame open ... open flame you could do it on rural or you can do it on your burner but they get the died bark charred mhm ...\nYou're probably missing the Smokey taste I bet\nYes yeah it is it that's it do you have a grill and open plain eating I Do\nThere is a wonderful recipe from my friend Elizabeth Carmel she's grilling expert she used to work for ... years ago she taught a lot of those guys who became famous everything they know about grilling\nShe has a book all about grilling I think it's the art of grilling I always loved her eggplant she takes a whole eggplant and she's done sit with garlic clubs\nAnd then she grills it and then she led to finish off heat so it picks up even more smoke it's a wonderful wonderful recipe I have to cook it\nSo long pat ... yes hall and it's it should really look like somebody pulled the plug out of a balloon right yeah with pleaded deflated and charred good but what's cool about her so she's got the garlic in it so bizarre looks cooking too because you always had garlic\nI think Chris is right you just need to chart in some way either on a direct flame or\nYou know under the broiler and you need to cook it till it's completely ... yeah ... yeah and\nThen also the genie if you went to Haiti to make sure you get a good brand of\nSome of the lower mention names but at the supermarket or just to buzz is your favorite brand assume s double O M sue where do you find it his two sisters in Philadelphia and poured it I should we sell it in our online store but it's very um smoothly doesn't separate really\nAnd it doesn't have the really bitter flavor to it it's really means it's fresh I think it's ... you can go rent it gets a million old yeah so make sure you could to he will\nOne restaurant owner that I asked said he thought that the difference might be he only uses Lebanese taking any and he said it could be the ... so I did get a Lebanese but I haven't made it since I bought the that to me I just got it this week well\nGood to be in charge of the plant and you're you're made your good\nGood well thank you so much I appreciate your pleasure thanks bye-bye\nYou're listening to military radio I'm your host Christopher Kimball if you have a question about instant pot dinners or slow cooker suffers give us a call at eight five five four to six Ninety four three one more time have five five\nFour to six nine eight for three or send us email questions and milk she radio dot com welcome to milk\nStreet who's calling and yes number is ...

comes from Ferguson Ferguson bath kitchen and lighting gallery proudly supports milk street corner crusaders everywhere bath kitchen and lighting collections in several styles available in store and online at ... dot com\nWhat about the third rail of modern food writing in restaurants which is the term authenticity a loaded term or through over was one uh do you have any feelings about the the current usage around authenticity or and how people are dealing with that in terms of food\nWell it's funny you should ask because I've just the gun try to do some research on what authenticity means in various aspects and my son was telling me that when he was a college both at Columbia University of Chicago\nThat was a serious topic a in many disciplines that everyone talked about what do we mean when we say uh dishes authentic do we mean it is old fashioned and made and exactly the way it was always made is that our authenticity different for different people\nDepending on your background because the whole subject of taste\nReally means opinion taste is a word\nThat his strictly means our pilot but we say she has a terrible taste and men or someone has a terrible taste and close so I'm not sure that my authenticity would be your authenticity it's quite nebulous and very interesting\nSo authenticity is relative [laughter]\nIts authenticity authentic [laughter]\nWell that's\nSee that's why you're that you're there most more famous food writer you virtually [laughter] so uh I I Do want to ask about this thing you're doing with uh the sport fault impassioned so you're doing a call in and asked me me call and how does that work\nI'm sort of a doctor roofs of food people call in from from all over the country or other countries such as Canada or Mexico\nAnd ask questions about food and sometimes life related like my mother in law doesn't like the way I cook and watch you know so you see immediately we're talking about much more than food\nUm and it's quite interesting to me the range of questions and the dilemmas people have over things that I think are so simple it makes me sad to think that they're worrying about such basic simple\nFood and life questions like uh I don't like vinegar because it's so acid how can I vinegar and a dish I said [laughter] try lemon juice or some of the sweeter than it goes like apple cider vinegar or Sherry vinegar\nI I I agree I I found to other things about people call in with questions one is\nA ... cooking is so social it's almost that old was the Cosmo column Kennedy's marriage be safe you know I mean that people say my husband like this I like that who's right [laughter] I think it's very those are the tough one to nobody's writing you're both right but there are some pretty serious ... out there and I think\nFor me it just feels to me like they're more more people doing more serious cooking and when I got started in this back in the seventies maybe I\nHad the impression that people sit watching the food network and your program while they send out for food [laughter] so they have time to watch a program\nTo wash my showing get takeout thanks for yeah [laughter]\nLast last question going back in time is there a moment that uh that really sticks with you because it was one of those things could never happen twice well\nOne of my most outstanding reviews that has followed me all over the years is the one I did on radios\nThe Italian Restaurant up and Spanish Harlem little dive where they tables and what happened to it after I reviewed it so that was one kind of very lasting thing\nWell we'll wait a minute let me stop you so what what was the review and what happened well\n... says this little two steps down from the sidewalk longtime\nRed sauce Italian Restaurant but very well done in Spanish Harlem\nAnd a local politician who was a friend of ours knew them and said we should go there and he wouldn't tell them who I Am and we went and and I was just blown away by the lemon chicken and the seafood salad and the pastas and I went back a few times after that\nMyself we one has foul county which was my married name\nAnd I gave it three stars\nAnd everybody went crazy including the restaurant they were furious they took the phone off the hook they close this came out in July they closed for the month of August thinking it would blow over\nAnd of course it didn't blow over and it grew and grew and so now they have a restaurant and Hollywood and they have a restaurant in Las Vegas and they have a whole line of prepared sauces\nAnd I'm at one of my birthday parties then owner Frank Pellegrino came and talked about how surprised they were because he said we didn't know anything about restaurant reviews we read the daily news we read the New York [laughter]\n[laughter] and it changed their lives so I was somewhat non plus because it was really a simple I'm I'm pre possessing place except for the law or a\nCouple of weeks after it came out I had a call from a lieutenant in the New York police force who told me it was a gathering place for the mafia\nAnd I'm In many many years later I was introduced to Norman Mailer and the first thing he says oh the woman who ruin regular mail\nYet [laughter] so you know it had a coterie of writers and and kind of in people and recognizing that and loving it and then finding out that the whole world was going to love it\nTo which is also true of all I mean literally and which was also true of the palm um it was very gratifying for me to feel that what I liked many many people like I didn't need it for a justification but at least I felt that was on the right track as a critic\nWell Norman Mailer had one other person to be upset with was a long list right [laughter]\nYeah I admired him though I admired him though he was a great ride\nMaybe thank you so much it's been an honor and it's also been a great pleasure thank you\nFor me to thank you very much Chris\nThat was a restaurant critic and journalists Mimi Sharon and Sharon is a columnist or the Daily Beast and she's also co hosting special episodes of his ... do ...\nThe series is titled ask me\nYou know speaking the shares and reminded me how much I just like the term food writing the term that implies a lesser degree of art along with terms like travel writing in sports writing\nWell it's actually pretty simple re riding is good writing and there's bad writing no matter what Thomas\nMimi shirt and reminds us that even in the age of social media good writing matters and so I leave you with her description of a French dish and title truffles under the ashes quote\nI was surprised to be thoroughly said by the stunning licorice over\nThe butter from interior as well as with a strong aroma and flavor of autumn leaves cold woodland air mystery birthing is an incredible balance of\nBitter sweet and salty\n... [noise] [noise] right now I'm heading into the kitchen a milk street to chat with when Clark about this week's recipe Tuscan beef peppers to Flint area I'm great credit so there's a recipe I you know the recipe it's a Tuscan beef in peppers do it's beef lots of beef obviously pepper ground pepper\nAnd why you don't see whatever just throwing the pot cooking slow come back a few hours later it's done\nI made this recipe before but the problem with a recipe I think is that when you just put wind it would be in a pot it takes a lot of the flavor out of the meat the meat is hardly flavor was and the wind is enriching anxious it's kind of just the city can kinda nasty actually\nSo I don't know how they used to do in Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen what do we do\nSo critically really took the wind out of the equation and in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation and so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of these really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pepper and we put that in a pot with some aromatic\nAnd no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to brace this lady comes from the meat itself there's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavor so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice\nAnd you're not ... tang bee before you put it in just you ... a little bit then put the meeting but you're not doing anything else to leave before because\nWe're not we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor assaulting me without actually having to do the work which you know we live around here\nSo instead of cooking the whole time covered we take the cut her off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning underneath there that you would have gotten if they ... at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the one so that was not in\nThe winds waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the recipe at the end I Hope", "show_name": "Christopher Kimball's Milk Street Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "07"}
