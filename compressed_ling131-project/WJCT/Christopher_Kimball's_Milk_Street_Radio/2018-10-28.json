was just trying to be super resourceful and a lot of times I\nI don't even notice it but being resourceful makes me feel refreshed like it makes me feel at ease and so that was really what I did with our project I just took old\nJars for my age and I I made I like took a lot of um wilted greens like things that we're about to go bad um that I Would typically throw out and I'd just blended them into salad dressings I don't know it was just a fun project to help people think about ways that they can\nBlend up things in their face and and and re purpose it\nOK you decorum ice cream sandwiches are are are we done with the unicorn now I mean ... where did you record come from it's sort of took over the Internet in\nI think it was a a a social media thing yeah I Know people I said that it was because people want it to escape from the reality\nSo um that recipe it was like basically a semi auto but then I use aqua ... instead of egg white\nAnd ... is just the brine um that you could get from like ... like ... like um like chick peas is like I'm a pretty common can that you could break could get it from because it's clear and so I think you just with that up just like you would an egg white and then you just folded into um instead of heavy cream I use coconut cream so\nYour your recipes are ... it's an interesting mix you peaches and cream cake bananas Morris pizza\nBut then you have ... muffins which my wife would learn cold banana bread so it's just a mishmash do you know you begin past your non begin passed I how would you define your baking\nYeah I mean I think that it's just me you know like I think that it it's all of the things that I've been influenced by\nIt it's not I guess expected a lot of things aren't expected because of maybe what your idea of what a black go to cook because I called the book that but I think that that's what makes it\nReal you know like people are a mishmash of all of these things you know and like I think that the more that we celebrate and just stop thinking necessarily about everything being authentic you know an authenticity and food and just play with\nThe techniques that you've learned or the way that you would approach it because that's also a part of your identity the ... the way that you've seen your grandma\nPut together something that comes with you and so then I I feel like if you're just being true to that then all of these new ideas just\nCome up like it didn't feel like I was trying to be creative about it I was just having fun\nYou also I noticed in your you have data and apple ham pies which look right but um you use all whole wheat pastry flower you mix it with white flour does that that work out okay for the pastry you can work it and it's um it doesn't fall apart on you\nI think it does like I mean I it's it's such a delicate do but I like it because I feel like I can work it for a while because I I have\nHigh hands then I feel like sometimes like really working the dough and and I know that when I use the white flour I like it it just gets super tough so for me it works but I feel like you know depending on the temperature\nWhile you're there among bakers folks have cold hands right\nI Know that exactly I Know I mean I got hired hands and your Baker so anybody can do it\nJust work in a goldfish is Jerome thank you so much just a pleasure to speak with you I really

new batch of questions I Am so ready welcome to milk street who's gone\nThere this is Laura from Louisville, Kentucky how are you\nI'm well how about you\nI think we're quite perky today I don't know what's wrong [laughter] doing all that\nI think some of my own bread more lately and recently true in a handful of sunflower seeds to one of my ... and they were residents salt and within twenty four hours every one of the friends of ours have turned into a bright green\nAnd actually I thought it was more I thought it molded really quickly and I had a refrigerated that love and everything and then I get a little bit of a game and I found a couple of website that said that might happen but\nThere wasn't a good reason unless they do or any kind of ideas for how to mitigate the green is that happens so I wanted to call it what you thought about that\nCertain foods are sensitive to changes in ph balance and sunflowers or one of them so when they're put into a battered that has baking powder and baking soda both of which are alkaline that can cause them to turn green with just a little bit of time passing\nWhat did you have in their baking powder and baking soda\nBaking soda yeah which is more alkaline and baking powder I Would you try to reduce the amount of baking powder in the recipe if you could and add a little bit of lemon juice and that should help but here's the thing even though they're green which is very hard it's like green eggs and ham you know to eat\nSomething that shouldn't be green that is going it won't hurt ya that's good to know for you to say oh I Know I don't know I Know a green but uh that is really what it is it's a chemical reaction\nIn that introduction you know if if the state of the sunflower seeds before matters like whether that risk that are salted or\nEither that's a very good quite well here's the thing I Would have thought that roasted would have made a difference you know but it's hardly it didn't in your case\nNow\nSo you could use sunflower seeds with the ...\nYes it's just when you have a chemical weapon yeah because you have baking soda so its alkaline the soda part of it that makes them turn color just changed the name of the bread to green something yeah\n[laughter] I mean that's what I ... yeah right it reaches efficient don't apologize never leaves are never apologized never explained just\nPresented is that's the way it was supposed to be amazing ... have these bright green muffins why not\nLike the session my right All right Laura so it's a it's a question of food chemistry\nYes thank you thank you Bye bye Bye bye\nWelcome to milk street who's calling\nHi uh my name's John Reilly where are you calling from uh near Albany New York how can we help you today so I'm calling about lam we have a a couple of restaurants nearby that have hello well above that are awesome\nAnd while I liked the lamb that I make it home it's never gotten quite close to what they do and I generally put some kind of olive oil lemon juice Rosemary and something like that on um [noise]\nCubes so they cut typically from a bowl of slugging when we're like him that I own a shoulder as well the great come out as a ... movie marinate them and I'm not sure what they might use\nAnd also I Know that it doesn't have any particular striking flavor certainly a slick Rosemary ... or something like that but you wouldn't have recall it flavor to something that just is a disparate\nYou like the texture or do you find it more tender or ... or you can fully\nMore tender I tend to like meet that is not as ... you know I'd rather flavorful than hundred my wife tends to like meet that is more tender I think also since its grilled you notice the difference in texture you know of the sleep trying on the outside of the center of the inside is worked under\nI Would guess that it may be the age of the animal because if it's a younger animal it's probably going to be more tender and if it's an older animal shoulder the is not going to work 'cause you need to cook the low and slow I can do\nSo you need the equivalent of allowing cut very expensive but it would have to be a law in cuts for quick cooking ... because you can't use lake and your kid's shoulder right\nOkay well you could you like it just would be chillier can be truly want which is what I've been doing yeah just because it's an easier to find and less expensive than I have another side which is salt ah yeah I mean I've always put some salt but right before you cook them just before ...\nWhy don't you try to get ahead of time tossing it with all those other things and then you know padded try or just ... oil it\nSo it gets a nice year I bet you the salt would make a difference okay yeah well I I Would ask them\nJust asked them about ... what kind of isn't the\nThey get their land with him in the search for this I did buy like a leg that hello Bush or sort of all I Am for me but uh that that didn't really help a and that was a young land but it was young enough that it was um\nYou know hard to work around the leg getting laid off of it so yeah he likes tricky\nI mean I the salty for two hours on Iraq is a good idea so yeah\nYeah I could give it a shot like thanks yeah but\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball\nAnd I think that when you you put a bouquet of flowers on the table and in school that children Chaz knows something intuitive thing\nAnd he knows it their cared about\nAnd and you don't have to be rich to have beauty your point\nNo you just can light a candle and it changes the whole atmosphere of the room\nYou had a a wonderful story about Bill Clinton I mean you were one of your your themes is you can change people through taste you know which I think is ... you you believe in transformation and the ability of\nTaste in food and cooking to change people's so your your dream was Bill Clinton will come in the restaurant menus surfing the perfect peach\nAnd that would change Bill Clinton somehow and so we actually did show up at one time and what happened\nA very sadly it wasn't peach sees [laughter] of course\nBut I had always imagine because he's from this out ... and if I could find a mouse in Modesto peach for him at just the perfect moment\nThat I could do this whole peach dinner and he would he go away thinking that life differently\nHave you ever been able to transform someone through taste experience food\n[noise] well that's what's happening at the edible schoolyard project but I have to say it's it is more than taste they are also opening up all of their ... their smelling things stay are touching things as part of their\nMath class when they're planting the seeds it's the whole\nExperience of doing it yourself and empowering yourself a around food that changes and I think forever\nOkay now we're going to change the topics briefly so while you were growing up college and after you were thrown out of your fraternity and morals charges which was drinking I think it was really shocked me and then then you told a story about living in Berkeley and\nSomeone broke in and tried to rape you and you actually\nJust propelled yourself out the window a to escape and uh that that must have been a ... this is one of the mid seventies\nYes late seventies it was and I didn't know that I had that in me and yet when the when that happened I was willing to screaming chump adamant that so\nThat is that a lot about you right\nNow and it kind of\nEmpowered me in a way that I didn't expect that um I guess I'm willing to take a risk\nAnd that's that was very important to me to know that about myself at an early age\nUm could you read for me you quote O'Toole autumn is one of your favorite poems I Believe it's in your book on page rather um maybe you just read the last part of it to swallow the gored I just thought it was a wonderful and just tell us about why you put that in the book\nI put in that because it was such a sensual food oriented tone that he wrote and I love the season of missing mellow fruit from this [laughter]\nClose with some friends of the maturing son\nConspiring with him how to load and bless with fruit to find the round that such east run\nTo bend with Apple's at Moffett cottage trees and feel all free with right now is to the core\nTo swell the gored ... they have little shells with the sweet current ... to ... budding more and still more\nLater flowers for the bees until they think warm days we'll never see first summer has your brand their economies cells\nIs that is that Keith ... who wrote that the heat yeah um let's talk about food your favorite recipe is mint tea I think actually [laughter] when I saw you like you made me ... but so explain that please\n[laughter] ah it's my favorite recipe because it only has two ingredients\nMeant and water\nBoiling water and I I just love recipe life [laughter] but he was surprised that that's all it is but if you have the best tomato a little salt ... that's in\nYour book really the theme that comes through for me is that your restaurant\nAnd your your career and your life going back to your mother\nYou said I was running a counter culture restaurant and it was so law really and and so you're always fighting against the culture or parts of the culture you Carly would describe as fast food or\nAs you said we're leaving our land behind we're forgetting about our children\nSo you your restaurant is really a an expression of your view of the world today\nI think you have said it well indeed it is\n... and I hope people don't\nFeel that when they're ... field the hospitality the openness to a restaurant the determination that we haven't been to how we ...\nWe put the names of the farmers on the menu he's done that for years and years and years and\nPeople commenting are you know ... ... you know and it's it it helps to make connections for people and\nThen the taste comes from the people who take care of the ...\nAlice thank you so much for your time\nMm that was Alice Waters her memoir is called coming to my senses the making of a counter culture Mm Mm\nI first met Allison shaping the back of the Nineteen eighties she was sitting at a table shelling keys and she didn't look like the typical chef\nTwo decades later I returned to shape for dinner\nAnd it was really struck by the food the essence of each ingredient was preserved and of course natural presented by the fact that Alice had severe she showed up if you will with so many other food celebrities have gone on to other restaurants in other careers and that got me thinking about the good life perhaps it's simple enough\nFind out what you like to do and just keep doing it or you might say it's really the mileage that matters as long as you keep driving straight line\n\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen and milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipe pasta controversial\nJay Maria I'm doing great it's possibly be day here in milk strayed it is about ... or as a lot of people say ... [laughter] but still exist recipes in hundreds of times I've done it many times you've done it but you went to Italy to see if there was something new or something that we don't know here\nYeah you know what it is such a simple dish and\nI guess that's what attracted me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have\nAn amazing amount of flavor and an hour max that they bring to the table and it didn't hurt that I learned it at this crazy winery that used to be owned by the mafia apparently the government took it away from the mafia and gave it to a retired stolen art inspectors around in the meantime of course of course because it's the ...\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was willing to teach me basic rustic civilian cooking and this was one of the dishes she taught the minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the richer Rome is a federal and Rosemary and garlic\nAnd it turns out that what she had done is frozen ... into a pot that had been soaked overnight\nFor in some wild federal but she grabbed from the driveway of the winery\nA ton of Rosemary and garlic cook to them away and when the beans were done to Austin some pasta started altogether and it was a ... for such a simple collection of ingredients to have such an amazing flavor profile they were layers of richness and creamy noticed and yet there was no dairy in it\nSo why is this different than the eighty nine versions all been through I think the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the basics here", "show_name": "Christopher Kimball's Milk Street Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "28"}
