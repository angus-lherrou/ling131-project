J. C. T. up in Jacksonville your community your world [noise]\n\nThis is the most your radio on your host Christopher symbol Ronnie ... traveled more than four thousand miles all across the Appalachian collecting stories of recipes for her book middle which had about our favorite dish chili bunch from the pool room and a distinctly Appalachian flavor that she called Wang is\nKind of fish [noise]\nAccent a shower and salty and maybe a little bit of wheat that just elevates whenever you're eating up to nothing about what it's like a good bluegrass Turner's singer me\nYou know you're listening to everybody else and they're working that straight and narrow and then the ... and gives you chills down your back and Wang does that when you eat in\nThe coming up more calamity talks about everything milk for creation myth ice cream machines we also traveled to the birthplace of past I'm Christopher Kimball but there's no street radio from Iraq coming up after the news\nTamil ... is more powerful than mirrors whom is\nMilking the mayor is is because they're kind of wild is kind of a hard thing to do right\nYeah yeah although milking camels isn't particularly easy either\nBut also means isn't so bad I'm you also made made a point which is obvious once you make it the cheese since its salted in preserved is really a safe way to consume milk\nRight [noise] yeah and and a lot of cultures or for instance the Greeks and the Romans that was the most common thing they did with no come under served a rare to drink milk but uh they made cheese\nYou also said that with raw milk cheese is the brief for example very much taste like the terrible ours we talk about a wine so exactly where it's from the season\nAll those things has a really strong impact on the cheese\nI absolutely and I I Lived in Paris for about ten years and I bought much cheese to very good uh from a tree\nAnd um you know we were talking about whether the cheese for your target or do you want for fall stuff do you want the springs stuff and uh with some cheeses it makes a huge difference\nUm ... baked Alaska you trace the orange and they said Jefferson liked to serve ice cream on a sponge cake with a lightly baked ... on top and eventually I think Fannie Farmer refers to does baked Alaska but that's where that I didn't realize that's where that came from\nYeah I ... I Believe she was the first one to call it baked Alaska they had similar names for it\n[noise] and then the ice cream makers invented nineteenth century you talk about Sunday's this was a little apocryphal story about the late Nineteen century\nYou said there was one ice cream store that holy added toppings to the ice cream sundae a girl comes in in a different day of the week argues that this must be Sunday hence the term Sunday that sounds a little apocryphal to me but yeah\nI have trouble believing yeah that's just a little bit of a lot of is it seems that ice cream stories are particularly dubious and the food world believing source of bogus stories is Marco Polo\nSecond is Catherine demanded she and I think third would be Thomas Jefferson food source involve any of those names you should take a second look at it so so what's a good example\nOf a of a a Marco Polo story\nThat he introduced pastas Italy was completely completely absurd there's process in Italy long before Markopolos probably introduced by Arabs\nWell you you do these books and you are dealing with his three all the time and that's a question I have for you when you start researching how do you get at the truth\nOh my God that I mean that is the the question of journalism isn't that how do you get it the truth and how do you know which version is true and sometimes you just have to give all the versions\nYeah but if you're talking about the Nixon administration for example is a little different than if you're talking about something that happened five hundred years ago you're you're\nYeah but you never know Nixon might have slipped out a truce when no one was looking [laughter]\nA lot more to touch the mark and a great pleasure making another great book yeah nice talking\nTo that was mark who in the new book is called milk\nTen thousand year who ...\nYou can subscribe to listen to mostly radio anytime as ... released new shows every Friday an apple pie can ditch your Spotify play into in\nDeciding to think if you recall from my co hosting molten there he is of course the star of service weekend meals on public television also author of home cooking one on one\nSarah how are you Chris I'm good I I think it's time to take some calls what do you think open up the lines let's go\nWelcome to milk street who's calling\nHi my name is Jackie I'm calling from Kalamazoo, Michigan\nI think this is our first Kalamazoo car yes how nice how are you how can we help you today\nSo my question about different except flour I've been watching a show set in Europe that I imagine many of your listeners are familiar with\nAnd the contest as often talk about ingredients like strong white bread flower strong planes flour and then Clinton flower which I assume it's like all purpose flower but what did he mean and how do we translate this to an American grocery store around looking at wheat flour all purple flower or even self raising well\nFirst of all the Brits sale you many him\n[laughter] I mean you don't have to do it well I you know we don't speak the same language is what I'm trying to say good faith or we speak American they speak English well I assume that a strong flower a strong bread flower means a high gluten flower strong would I think relate to the gluten content\nSo a plane flower would be all purpose flour\nI actually think a plane flour it has no rising stuff in it so it's it's not self rising not self right then they called fail phrasing or something crazy like very good yeah so plane is without that extra stuff but it's strong bread flower would be ... I think we can agree on that\nAgain I don't know you know percentage wise how they stack up next to each other\nWell in this country gold medal for example is ten till eleven percent including\nBut I Believe the king Arthur is closer to twelve percent so a high gluten all purpose flower in this country you go to king Arthur yeah a bread flower is going to be running Thirteen fourteen percent clue and\nSo I think a strong flower for said strongly flour I Would use king Arthur\nAll purpose and a strong bread flower would just be a bright flour so let me ask you a question on the show\nWhen did they specifically referred to one of the strong flowers\nA master class\nWhere they'll talk about how to make different types of bread for example and they'll actually walking through the steps so I'm thinking about the episode about ... and they were talking through all the steps and and now I don't remember which one it was but I Want to say it was strong white flour that they reference than I like what is that and how do I find that\nWell ... you would want a strong flour and she bought a has a lot of holes in it and that is because of the high hydration that as a high percentage of water but also high gluten flower will help with that so I just think a strong bread flower simply means ... brand flower yeah so why do you love the show\nIt's really fun I don't really care for reality shows accept everyone is so nice if not particularly dramatic and I learn things and then I come up with questions like what strong like Fred [laughter]\nAnd they've got a British accent which makes it all the nicer I Know that are on so cute [laughter]\nPsaki thank you very much yeah hopefully that helps thank you for taking my call okay take care\nWelcome to melt street who's calling\nThis is the address from Naples, Florida how can we help you\nUm I think a lot a and one of the things that I was interested in getting the same thing but I also have chicken and so I don't buy my eggs I just take my chickens gives me\nAnd it says to only ... eggs that had been pasteurized and I don't know how it goes about doing that with my own eggs or necessary or what\n[laughter] you know they get two very different answers you're probably for the ball I also get my eggs from a someone who actually works on the show who\nKeeps chickens the only problem with that as you really have to make sure they're clean properly mhm I don't know what the like when you get your own but make sure they're really well cleaned on the outside 'cause that's where the contamination is going to come from\nOkay secondly I don't personally worry about raw eggs but\nAnd if the or their own chickens if you clean the well I Would think you are okay but it is a risk that it pasteurized okay I have to get them up to that temperature one sixty but okay I wouldn't worry about it\nNo I wouldn't either a supermarket eggs are very well clean there's a film on the outside of an egg when you harvest it\nYeah it definitely feels ... right and it protects the eggs from air getting in to the egg but the supermarket eggs are that's rinsed off and then they read or held them or they put something on the outside to protect the egg but they're very very well clean\nChristmas right is the outside of the egg that really need to make sure gets cleaned you know it's one of those things you know you you want to say the over eighty the under five and the immune impaired perhaps should not have the zags\nUnless they're taken to at least one sixty but I think other than that\nYou know you're fine you know just don't leave them\nOut forever and the good thing about your legs it's they're really fresh which means so beat up beautifully because they are so fresh\nThank you so much I appreciate it take care thank you Beatrice hey\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you have a ... question please give us a call at eight five five four to six nine aid for three that's eight five five four to six Ninety four three or send us an email questions have milk street radio dot com\n[noise] Hi this is Terri Hi how are you\nHow can we all do well\nI remember hearing a you're a very simple recipes for at grade\nSomething to put on steak when you're really though I'm a granite molasses friends and I looked and looked to try and find something like that so I wondering if they can at least some ideas\nOf wave pomegranate relapses and very simple recipes like for really chicken or steak or even vegetables anything like that\nAppalachia that share certain characteristics with parts of Japan and parts of China that don't show up and and other places\n... let's talk about being a ... and ... what the names are so great so I'm going to ... to live with the gal her the lens may notes holy land Rosa beauty case life being to Greece whose Baylor Logan giants and the toys chambers greasy cut short\nI just like wow you know it's so beans were obviously very important part of the food was but these games are just fabulous\n[noise] well and this is so southern Appalachians neat so first of all on beans are vital because you were using the pig in order to supplement you were using it as seasoning you weren't putting a big piece of meat on the table\nAnd so the bean itself becomes the protein\nSo everybody planet beating everybody planet beans beans mutate spontaneously and easily adapting to the sunlight and the mineral quality in the ground at the time of day is et cetera et cetera\nSo that I can give you mine bean and two years later if you've lived on the other side of the holiday\nYou would be growing and being from my bean seed that would have different characteristics and so families and and people would name the beans after their family are after the region where it's grown and there's the road mountains that is I Want to build best beans\nAnd then they would give them funny names tune like there is little lazy wife means which is a ... is always a bean with a large being in a large bean seed in it because when you think about it you string it unless you get more being for your\nFor your work uh apples I did recognize a lot of these calls for thousands of rise the jelly flowers sweet the summer Rambo right the winter job the crows egg the bar the Flathead follow water ... the\nSo I assume the apples in the south obviously the north the temperatures\nThat they're designed a to be grown in sort of a different climate\nYeah the history the apples here um Jefferson sent many many many many apples and to Appalachia because unlike the the deeper south it has a wonderful spraying it has a um good ripening summer and then it has a cold snap\nThat is what really brings out the flavor and apples and Apple's kind of do the same thing that that the beans do which is that they will adapt to their surroundings and and and mutate and create all these different apples and so\nThere are apple hunters they're called in the Appalachian region who have interviewed people and cotton descriptions and tasted apples when they could cetera et cetera\nAnd so ... it's thought that there were well over a thousand variety is um that were grown in Appalachia initially um to make cider but then um the apples became a foodstuff in it and it became a thing that you took pride in\nA year apple had a distinct flavor and it has an impact on\nThe food the apple ... cake which has made or have dried apples they're really traditional way to do it is not to put spices into it and the reason why is because you're apple had a distinctive flavor and that we've come through\nYou know I talk about my mother being able to teach my sister and me just by looking which green beans to load up on at the family reunion because she knew who grew and cook the best ones and you could tell by science\nAnd so you could tell by taste at one time somebody is apple stacked cake because you knew their apple\nSo let me just mentioned a few recipes shore up pickled baloney with pepper [laughter] come on now tell me about that one\nOh wow well that's I'm a I met a woman was doing that Wendy Johnson and and I kind of took off with the fundamental recipe that she had and and you made it a more elaborate and it echoes those big jars of pickle baloney that we're just such a treat and\nA sit in a fire in the mountains of good times you know if you could afford to have the the grocer chop off a piece of pickled baloney you were doing well\nAnd so we came up with this homemade version of it and Chris that have been for the last year and a half I've been traveling around talking and doing dinners you know how folks will do a dinner based on your book and that recipe is the single most popular one with contemporary chefs ah they love it they love it and the audience loves a scrape\nOff at a sweet potato soccer now I've I've research is the one time or another lots of origin or maybe or yeah or that term could you describe what it is and what it means\nMore so than North Carolina the version of soccer that this is based on which is the one made around mount airy North Carolina is actually a cobbler and that is larger than the normal cobbler\nAnd it has a gel on the bottom end to do on the top and then it has what's called milk dip which is a warm milk sugar concoction that when you take the ... out of the oven you pour that over the top\nAnd it seeps into it I suspect that in foodie having some day there won't be an entire room that is just devoted to people loudly arguing about what's the difference between a cobbler in a stronger and abetting a crisp and you know all the all the terms\nOf things that you can get three people to Rome and get five opinions right exactly [laughter] so\nWhat's happening to apple watch now is it is it a million different stories is it going back to find food ways the roots obviously you're involved with the ah it it's going to keep some of the past there was a like most of the rest of America we just keep moving into the future\nUm well Appalachia I I Will say more than ... ...\nYou know there are other regions there are other cultures that value their past because of our story telling history which I was going to cite is another reason why we name or beans because then we can tell you the story about it and there's nothing we love better than a story unless it's eating and they're both kind of in the same\nRoom so Appalachians are young Appalachians\nAre very keen to embrace their history and\nA couple of things have changed in the economic landscape there is the absence of coal\nWhich is of course being argued about now but uh at the time that I wrote the book was perceived as a done deal and in the wake of that\nCommunities aren't looking to establish smaller economies that are entering laced with one another and therefore sustainable some food becomes a piece of that you know food becomes\nA piece of something that can be produced to be sold elsewhere but can also feed you and your family\nIt becomes a gathering place for the people in the community food is a way to to create a tourism economy and farming can become a way to to continue to stay on the land and continue that tradition\nSo we aren't as we have always been in an interesting moment in Appalachia I'm and I'm I just feel incredibly fortunate to get to ride around in my ... and write about it it's pretty fun\nRonnie thank you so much a fascinating book and uh it's just nice when someone takes the time and the years and the hours to really to really do the research and find out what's actually going on Ronnie thank you so much thank you Chris\n...\nThat was Ronnie ... her book is called Littleton Appalachian Journey with Russia\nYou know growing up in Vermont the locals hadn't teams have some place one family name there's three tutor road and the next week neighbors across the way to put up a sign Skidmore boulevard every hill and valley was named for reason minister hills swearing hills selfies quarters wrote in bear mountain\nAppalachian takes its name seriously to\nLogan giant greasy cut short or the names of Appalachian beans\nToday things are named by marketing directors in Appalachia name so real stories about real people in a room\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen a milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto general\nJ. Mario I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is a and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well came through base was better than ours but you went to Italy to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nYou know one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong\nFirst of all our ratios ingredients for way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough ... they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist without\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course produce the thicker more luxurious sauce we think we have to finish beforehand that doesn't work", "show_name": "Christopher Kimball's Milk Street Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "21"}
