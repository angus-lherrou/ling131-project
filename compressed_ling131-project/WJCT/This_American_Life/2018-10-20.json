was amazing and this was there and my dad came down from Canada to be there and my mother in law and it was two days of labor which is called labor for reason\nIt's hard work but then before I knew what they are putting the syrup stuff and telling me oh it's going to be time to push to and like not a big deal and I realize I had learned everything about pregnancy\nBut nothing about actual childbirth\nMy brain flashes to a book sitting on opened on my bedside table\nIt's called prepared to push [noise]\nI have not read it I was not prepared to push I start I'm hyperventilating panicking I turned to bits and I say I'm so sorry but I'm not I I Can't do this I'm not strong enough I turned to the midwife and I say I'm going to die she is not phased by this she is sort of a four [noise]\nI guess I'm and she she\nBends down and gets nose to nose with me and she says you are doing a good job the best job no one on earth is doing as good a job as you are right now\nAnd this was like a magic style\nI realized I could do this and I help his hand and I hope my\nDad's hand and I pushed and pushed as hard as I could and at one point I looked\nDown and there's just goose bumps all over my arms and all over my legs and then I don't know what's going on but I sort of ... all over everyone in because I'm Canadian I start apologizing to everyone for throwing up on them while I'm In labor [noise]\nUm but eventually they start screaming at me to to slow down and and stop pushing just pushing teeny tiny bits and everyone is yelling and there's all this noise\nAnd then everything stops and there's this wet slurping sound\nAnd then he's out [noise]\nAnd they hold my baby up in the light and he's listening like all those movies you ever saw\nAnd he opens his mouth\nAnd he had his first cry and his voice echoes through me and\nAll of that hope that I thought I lost it all comes rushing back because a baby means hope it means you believe there will be tomorrow that the world is good enough for your child and they put them on my chest and he feels like a baby bird\nAnd before he Leon Riley run in to meet their baby brother I looked down at him and his ten fingers and toes and and a full head of a black curly hair just like me and that's when I realized\nHe could have been a monster he could have had two heads and a fork tongue and the tail and I would've loved him just to save him [noise]\nTo me he would have been perfect thank you [noise]\n\nWas reached and taking pictures of printing pregnant and then with the baby and with Beth and the whole family visit the mom and dad or [noise]\nI spoke with tricked him to get some more details about his extraordinary story and I asked him what it's like to be alive at a time where so many boundaries are changing\nYeah I mean I Hope that we're ... uh as as human beings and I know that uh\nYou know my my mum actually when I was pregnant to bumped into a friend of hers or who was also in her seventies and living in Canada and the woman was kind of jokingly saying something about her dysfunctional family and my mom thinks that she's going to wind up her friend and says oh you think that's crazy my son is pregnant\nAnd instead of being totally shocked and dismayed as my mother expected the woman's eyes just totally filled with tears and she was like Janet isn't it amazing that we've lived to see this world where anybody can be whatever they most want to be\nAnd and that's what I sort of like to imagine as not that things are changing but that opportunities are opening\nUp indoors or opening up that have been closed for people like me for a millennia\nDo you find that people make assumptions because you are because you gave birth to the baby that you have a more maternal role and is that even is that an offensive question even I don't know\nNo it's not I mean I think that it's it's like totally healthy to be curious about the way that role play out in any eligibility family because they think a lot of people were born into the assumption that moms do a certain thing and dads are meant to a certain thing and for us we've kind of taken all those puzzle pieces and\nShaking them up and then made something completely new so I work fulltime I I'm more of the like traditional like breadwinner role so even though I carry them gave birth to Leo I work and Beth who did not give birth to him these home full time and is that sort of front line parent for all three of our kids\nAnd what tips you have for people who are welcoming trans people into their lives were recognizing them for the first time\nI I mean so I was so many but I think the primary thing I Try to teach allies as like\nSometimes someone feels like their goal as an ally is to like not offend someone and I feel like you're going to fail if that's your goal only because it is still so difficult to be trans in America today\nThat whether you mean to or not you're probably going to step into something that for us there's like a big well of hurt to there I think about it like a bruise you don't have to hit a bruise very hard for it to really hurt\nSo for me like your goal as an ally shouldn't be oh I don't want to offend you um your goal should be the kind of person where if someone says hey I don't like that or I use this word instead or that really hurts me that you can be the kind of person I was like oh I'm so sorry tell me what I should say instead\nAnd that's at the you know that you're not super defensive\nUm that you don't try to turn it back around on them or sell yourself an apology parade where all of a sudden we are trying to make you feel better for some reason like don't do that just be that kind of person that can say oh I'm so sorry what can I Do instead\nLike that's like my
