politician does that mean\nWe like politicians we we feed on that show\nAnd then it happened it's just like he predicted after seven days of being treated as a Democrat\nOr at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP\nOn Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for\nOn friday sleek announced his decision he's a yes on cabin on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho's thought the FBI report was a disgrace basically didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not\nTell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI report\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people that's a terrible temper only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no idle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro is not\nIt and consequently I got on the jury\nThe case with the state of Texas versus Paul David story story was twenty two year old accused of the murder of Jonas cherry the manager of the mini golf course in Hearst Texas\nStory and an accomplice forced cherry into the back office made them unlock the safe and put the money a few hundred dollars in a bag\nAnd then they shot him multiple times story's trial lasted\nTwo weeks and when it felt familiar to anyone who watches TV courtroom dramas there were lawyers with thick binders full of ballistics report and medical examinations character witnesses recalled and disturbing photographs of the victims\nBody were shown the only thing missing was any suspense that the verdict\nThere was no doubt\nThat he was guilty of murder and robbery and [noise] and so really as a jury or we have to worry about with censoring\nThe jury to decide between life imprisonment or the death penalty is seeing the victim's family knew what they wanted they should go without saying the prosecutor announced the stand and the other jurors that all the Jonas his family and everyone who loved him believe the death penalty is appropriated\nThe prosecutor asked the jurors to sentence Paul story to death instruction stated that for the death penalty to be imposed the jurors must judge three things to be true that Paul story was guilty\nThat there are no mitigating circumstances like say mental illness or provocation and lastly the story posed a future threat to his community\nThat was the one I had an issue with I\nSeriously doubt it that she would be a continuing threat to the prison in the\n... what what was it about a ... story that made you feel like you just didn't necessarily see him as a continued threat\nI'm On a couple of times uh his testimony\nThe young man's fence in the courtroom appeared confused in over his head and remorseful this was his first offense and some of the evidence suggested that it was stories accomplice who'd been the mastermind behind the horrible crime as well as the one who fired first on it so then was certain that Paul story should be punished or they didn't think it should be put\nTo death but [noise] I'm In the\nDirt chambers there was a very different feel everyone else was in favor\nOf the death penalty so faced with you know almost a dozen other people who already felt strongly\nI didn't think I could convince anyone uh uh of of what I was thinking I was I was I'll be honest I'm scared\nAt twenty seven ... was the youngest or by several years and he was a kind of guy\nWho avoided speaking up at all cost at home his neighbor parked in his face let it go\nAt the office it's a fast told them to do something even if you disagreed he did it without question\nIn other words even though he's been looking forward to being a juror when he found themselves in the jury room\nSpend wasn't exactly Henry Fonda and twelve angry men the way he understood at the jurors had to reach a unanimous decision and the idea of swaying eleven strangers over to his way of thinking seemed impossible [noise]\nHe was also afraid that if he opposed the group it would result in a hung jury in a mistrial they'd have to start the whole process over again with a new Jerry everyone would be mad at him so since had nothing\nAn hour and a half later Paul story was sentenced to death by lethal injection\nIt was hard to look at him during the sentencing um we [noise] we sat waiting for the judge to ask us do what's the sentencing\nAnd everyone was really tense and the woman next to me and others are uh begin crying she was trying to hide it you know and I gave her my handkerchief and\nShe just hopes [noise] been the foreman announced the verdict [noise] and I think his mother cried out they had an exit for us to go through after we collect things\nAnd we were out of the courtroom fast\nIt felt like a mistake right away then went over to his\nParent's house where you had dinner and drink scotch with his dad he told his family about the trial and then he went home where you had more to drink before bed\nAnd then that was that was over and uh [laughter] and I went went on with my life or at least they try to but what do you do with with these feelings\nUm I've I've I was just stuck you know it was done was cast in stone and um yeah no I felt terrible I felt massive amounts regret I felt [noise]\nI've I've ... I felt guilty or you know sending someone to throw\nWhen you think about the people that a trial affect you think of the victims and their loved ones and do you think of the accused their families and what they're going through you don't usually think about what it does\nTo the jurors but for span the trial wasn't something he could put behind them at the crack of the gab all [noise]\nIn the days and weeks after the verdict you rent every article about the case he could find\nSo eventually he just stopped\nI realized it wasn't really healthy\nAt the time span was a regular drinker\nAnd it only got worse after the trial I got a lot worse after the trial\nHe was drinking more beginning as soon as he got home from work and spending more days hung over his wife didn't understand what was going on\nIt may have contributed to my divorce which was the phone there\n\nA year after the trial and fans life changed the new house with a hammock and the flagpole was sold and spend moved out of Texas\n\nSen settled in Olympia, Washington to start his life over he found an apartment for himself and his cat Nico but he couldn't shake his memories of the trial you try to escape through alcohol but it's industry in front of a shame sometimes after a night out drinking you return to a Facebook page Paul stories mother had made for her son\nOne mother had already lost her son and now because fan had been too afraid to speak up another mother was going to as well\nI'm not trying to excuses crime it was terrible but to send the guy that does not just the the presents and your mind the uh\nFor for current thoughts about it cannot go away\nFor all the bad rap that gets shame offers a certain safety it provides a comfortable who'll to hide in the way from the judgment of others\nBut it can also lead to isolation and a nurse yeah and for eight years eight years in which Paul story sat on death row awaiting an execution date send barely talked about the trial with anybody\nBut then in two thousand sixteen the year after\n... stories federal appeal it than that I ...\nA reporter writing a series of articles about the judicial system approach than about his experiences that your\nFriend was tired of being alone with his regret and so for the first time he opened up about his feelings\nI felt guilty he told a reporter and sad\nI don't think I made the right call [noise] Bennett hope the talking about the trial might help and it did\nUp until the article was published\nThat was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who read the article\nFearing his co workers might over here he took the call outside behind his office building\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier\nHe misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI Fox incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to\nConvince everyone to choose life imprisonment when\nIn fact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would have taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fend could've cast so they would have been known this trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole [noise]\nThat would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nAfter the article was published something else happened something's fan\nNever expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with them how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and I ...
