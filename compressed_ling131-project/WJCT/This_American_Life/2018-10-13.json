that they keep inside and forget about [noise]\n\nSo um so after a while I just couldn't take it anymore\nAnd I'm One making when I was visiting my parents um and my family at their summer home which was a couple of towns away from Sharon\nI I'm I'm I see my reflection and the torch window and I start to sob and my uncle who's sitting a couple of feet away from me in a weaker couch looks over and

rocky\nWho was ten at the time and my mom\nSomehow found out and um uh she liked a cigarette and she just me down to sit and she says what the hell are you thinking and\nIs a way of coming on really strong 'til you realize that uh she just it's just her way of fighting for you and she eventually just says I just don't know what you never look out for your heart and and said mom who looks out for their hearts anymore [laughter] and she\nSays you know what I think you should invite him over for dinner I I mean as you invite him over for dinner and have dinner with me and probably I think it would be fun\nI said what\nAnd she said yes this is who you are ... someone's going to like you have to love all sides of you know you didn't minimize yourself for somebody else and and and so I don't

my brother who's ten um he's too young to know what's going on but he kinda knows what's going on and he gives me this look from across the table it's kinda like interesting evening huh\nBut what what what I'm just so happy because I finally have my voice back and and um and I realize that you can have a lot of courage to run away from home and to try new things but it takes twice the amount of courage to be able to come back\nAnd and um I realized that he wasn't the special guests that my mother invited to dinner that night that special guests with me [noise]\n\nOne that grand slam\nPicture

nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes [noise]\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district ... hire the best record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nDate people on this team only two teachers solitude for the rest are a guidance counselor to custodians that three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team vicious pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm Wondering how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school\n[noise] other details got him or something like what to do a fire alarm goes off during the photographs [noise]\nThinking on this is a lesson from Jonesboro middle school shooting in Arkansas Twenty years ago [noise]\nThere were two shooters both kid [noise]\nOne of them pull the fire alarm to get to school to evacuate to a field where from the woods the boycotted\nThem ... ... people died [noise]\nAnd the training of Douglas they address to the exact thing\nAs a fire alarm and a code red happen to coincide ignore the fire alarm mind the code red [noise]\nActually told her students the code red drilled Trump's all if you hear a fire alarms go off you say put\nThe main question from students both Melissa and actually told me if I'm In the bathroom and I hear gunshots what do I do then we\nTold them to run if you're out in the hallway and there's a code red you have to find a place to hide your spouse either find a place to hide or are you running you keep running and you don't look back\nYou run you run as far away as you can and as fast as you can away from the sound\nAnd like Melissa actually been through this kind of training before out of school she taught before Douglas\nThat school had a ... that really freaked Ashley out very loud realistic sounds of gunfire actually says they were blanks\nThe officer would walk around with blanks and they would shoot at the door was open they'd go into the room and say you're all dead inherit\nSurprise drills with blanks well not the norm appeal to some school\nTo say there are benefits to learning kayaks under pressure to surprise drills with blanks or controversial for one thing they're disturbing there even been lawsuits about them and want to teach her claim she got the TST after a man and a black hoodie came into her class pointed a gun to her face fired and said you're dead\nTo feature her to hop she smelt smoke she really thought she'd been shot she had no idea what the trail I talked to several school safety experts about these drills with planks\nSurprise drills that are hyper realistic none of them thought there are a good idea [laughter] one guy who trains teachers using video simulation told me that teachers who've been through one of the surprise drills perform worse on his simulations\nAnd teachers who have no training at all they forget crucial that like calling the police and commit more dangerous mistakes\nSome find the blanks upsetting that can't even finished a simulation and there's a more basic problem the surprise drills [noise]\nIf you know when it's coming and if you're shot how can you tell that to drill the real thing [noise]\nIt does I actually am a list of both thought this was kind of drill they'd have\nUnannounced but the fake shooter firing line\nActually told their students that's what they should expect\nOh yes one hundred percent I told him I said it could happen at any point in time so just be prepared that no matter what your classroom you're enter where you're at this could take place\nThey said it was going to sound real and feel real I now have another faculty member who is that another high school and the district and they did the active shooter training at her school and they they use blanks they like it was it was simulated and it felt real and so that's why a lot of people were like\nIs this the drill is not the drill but when you look at the time that it occurred\nThey don't run a drill it to twenty five in the afternoon Fifteen minutes before we dismiss and all these buses have to run the kids all over the district without a question\nIn your mind right away like it's too late for a true yes\nWhich brings us to the day of the shooting at two twenty in the afternoon on Valentine's Day a former student with an hour Fifteen began down the hallway of the first floor of the building that everyone calls the freshman building and an adjacent building actually calling every class had just finished their shrimp can't be lab there are plaguing and cleaning up\nSo I'm standing next to my door pulling my door stop out I'm here to pops it was not rapid fire it was just like a pop pop I'm not start off by it because I mean a Valentine's Day and you don't know if it's like a balloon popping or what and then the fire alarm went off very quickly\nIn the fire alarm dusted off\nDust from acoustical child hit by a round of gunshots no one knew that at the time\nMelissa and a building farther out than Ashley's didn't hear any pops just a fire alarm\nShe went into action running natural the fire drill\nAlarm goes off and I counted the kids as as they left the room as the last one to leave close the door was already locked 'cause I leave it locked out the door with my phone ... and my father does like the famous important things my phone the key is amiss holding\nHer emergency folder that's the training\nI went out the doors that security person who's posted outside my hallway she's there she's and I said oh what's going on because they have walkie talkies I don't the security personnel have walkie talkie so she said someone set off a firecracker and the twelve hundred building and I said OK and turned to two other teachers and I told them and then as soon as I finish saying that she out that\nNo go back it's a code red go back it's code red and so we called to the kids and I turned around and went back to my room which is right there opened up the door and kids start streaming in\nBut was this a real code red molested in now she knew a fire alarm could go off during a code red but the whole thing was confusing\nWell it was weird because we actually had a ... actual fire drill earlier in the day like\nLike our plans scheduled monthly drills had occurred that morning so it was weird that it was going off again because they don't do them in the last period of the day and so I knew it was something but I didn't think it was a serious something I thought it was like a the common area was cooking with oil that day so who knows say\nIs that oftentimes set up and fired for us we'll set it off if they burn something or whatever so there are other things that set a fire drill a well kids sometimes probably pull kids will pull it off sometimes there could be like a faulty that's like a wire system gets affected all the time\nIt just depends but most of the most is calling area because Ashley Chris will kill me but a lot of times is calling area one time we went outside three times in one day because of the ...\nThree times yeah I mean we have three smoke detectors in my room so if you walk underneath it was a pot of boiling water you will set the fire alarm off that's kind of like the joke of our school\n\nTeachers have Douglas knew that code red Trump's a fire drill\nThey even had a plan to straighten that confusion out\nMake an announcement clarify the code red\nOn that day and assistant principal Mr Porter did that\nIs there an announcement on their ... but a lot of people are already out of the room so they didn't hear it\nIn ... I actually heard the code red she's not sure about it but she's going through the motions she does ... shut and she does\nTo always come running around the corner and they're they're just they looked terrified and they're screaming it's shooter shooter\nShe pulls them into our classroom tells them to get in the storage closet with her students but she's still thinking drill right it must be it must be for practice even seconds later when she hears\nPop up up up up up up up up and to me I'm like okay that's not what I experienced in the first ... just because of the rapid session that was happening at the time I was like maybe they're they're up in their game on that\nIt's unclear how many teachers thought like Ashley and Melissa did that this was not a real code red but the promise code red drill and if this cost anyone their life I spoke to the Broward County chief of staff in charge of organizing the district safety upgrades were Douglas's he said he didn't know any teachers that Douglas\nCame out of that training expecting an unannounced roads blanks or the age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she plans to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building looking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's\nThere they're not\nThere there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nFor like the next Ninety seconds if kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people reading and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nKnowing moves not a single class evacuated\nWas his says it's too scary to be out there standing in the parking lot like that vulnerable\nIt's what they know now\nDrills have Feinstein\n\n...
