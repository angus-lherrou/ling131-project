think\n\nIt made me I think I felt sad for her\nI remember thinking this is sort of in retrospect but I think I had some sort of inkling of this idea at the time I'm just I'm just sort of not realizing that but I think [noise]\nI remember thinking that he was one of the few people that you had in her life and she couldn't even really depend on him\nYeah there were probably right David

Jordan's married it's it's an addict\nMy mom asked a friend who worked for the city to search all this and the birth records\nI contacted high school alumni associations as friends at high powered newspapers to run background checks\nFinally there was one former Susan Jordan who stood out\nShe seen the right age she was married and living in Cincinnati suburb she had a couple of kids her husband was a lawyer I got a number from information and it wasn't until I sat down to color that it hit me a phone call from someone you babysat Twenty years ago might not be a welcome surprise but in fact strange and creepy\nHere I Am a practicing sounding benign one to one to\nSusan Susan Jordan the Susan Jordan [laughter] [noise]\nFinally I made the call\n[noise]\nHello hello Hi this is Susan yeah Hi um my name's Alex Bloomberg and I'm I'm calling from from a radio program called this American Life and I'm I this is the primary strange phone call to receive but I was wondering first of all you do you remember me [noise]\nIt turns out there are a lot of Susan Jordan too don't remember me a lot one guy even called his ex wife a former student Jordan and then called me back to tell me she never heard of me I was getting nowhere by myself so I contacted a professional one urban ...\nCertified New York city private investigator\nThree days after putting them on the case I got a message saying he'd founder I called them back\nI call the morning early or roughly around seven thirty mhm\n[noise] but she didn't want to go to introduce myself or I should ah my name is shall we saw in a row life as part of the good of a New York and I'm looking for someone I used to live in Cincinnati and what would it take to school there are neighbors the toilet issues in Jordan\nShould that be and I said okay and I said I uh do you know anybody they the VIX Blumberg and right away she baby shower [laughter]\nIs um\nThe interesting part about the whole thing is she definitely like shoo remembers you and the [noise] she's going to call you\nHello this is Susan yeah this is Alex Bloomberg Hi Alex my family I'm doing okay how are you mind if you get my email\nI got your email yeah okay and I I called you at work and then I realized that I I'd also gotten this number from the from the private investigator Susan and I talked for over three hours on the phone is catching up comparing notes that she asked about my sister in kids that used to live in the street in our own family Don how're you doing I'm doing okay\nIt was amazing how much she remembered and how much we remembered and comment even small incident like the time that we were stopped at the traffic light and I stay on too long at the guy in the motorcycle\nI think I remember that was the only eerie avenue\nProbably probably and he said he said something to you and I said no he didn't say anything to me and he said he said something to you didn't and you were about to get out of the car and the bad guys as I'm sure\n[laughter] I think I can remember your face I think you were staying very ill with your hands in your lap where are you afraid\nI was terrified that [laughter] yeah I didn't know that he would notice [laughter] but uh [laughter]\nWell don't worry but I I Would have taken him now [laughter]\nI had no fear I'm telling you\nYou know we it was like maybe\nSix or seven or eight years after you baby sat us\nAnd I was working to restore yeah\nYeah I remember [laughter] in Norway trainer was right at the thrift way yeah [laughter] I remember I guess you were you begging my groceries at this but I didn't recognize you\nI don't you told me the word and then I did\nI think you said ...\nLike I did warp you [laughter] people they'll call you that [noise]\nSusan got married when she was still in college and went to work for the\nShe spent the next Twenty years or so hanging from a telephone pole and she said\nShe hated us the money was good\nAround the time her first marriage ended she finally got the courage to quit and find work using her degree\nNow teaches at a special school for mentally ill children\nShe lives in Florida with her second husband she seems happy\nOf course when you ... back into the past like this you find a partial an incomplete your memory is\nFirst or the facts you get wrong\nTurns out Susan had been a college freshman when she babysat us\nNot in high school like I thought\nMy sister remember she's written a motorcycle also not true\nAnd the guy who she got in the fight with the cats in my mind was her Harry seventies boyfriend turned out to be her roommates boyfriend\nBut besides the fact you change that affects you completely admit that fight or the cats Susan had forgotten totally that I'd been there and it was a little strange because my presence was the only thing she forgotten other details you remembered time even the names of the cats themselves\nPossum and Tom we were hillbillies to remember that uh [laughter] and uh but I Can't imagine what I took you over there for\nI'm sure it was for you know I think we were just running errands fish that lucky [laughter]\nIt's it's funny because when I when I like you know I remember these very particular incidents and that was one of them and and\nProbably the reason I remember it is because it seemed very significant to you I think a sense as a kid that that you were that it was really upsetting to you because it it I think I felt at that time that you didn't really have very many people in your life at that point you can trust\nOh I didn't have I didn't have hardly anybody my whole family moved out of town I had no family oh let's see I moved out that day I graduated from high school mhm\nAnd I was Seventeen cars I started a year early ahead I just wanted out every day that I found out that I got the scholarship mhm\nI packed up that night [noise]\nWhy did you want to get out to about 'cause my family wouldn't dysfunctional that my mom and it was pretty bad\n[noise]\nThe girl that I Lived with\nAt that time she was taken all on a truck\nAnd every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something and I I really do much at all\nAnd it was really\nIt was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I missed that for a little bit I missed it I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone and I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember yourself on that that was because I think it works both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we bonded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it\nIt's only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean that people are complicated\nNow what I really wanted to spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was shy and know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead\nIt sounds yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\nThere's a muscle memory it was there you know you know the movements are all locked in the lyric in the beach\nAnd the and the ... you know and and as I played them they all started to come out and it was just like a sort of like being a merry unnatural
