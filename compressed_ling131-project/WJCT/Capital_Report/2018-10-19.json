manage recovery efforts Ken parks an incident commander from Montana flew in the day after the storm\nSo we're still hovering around sixty Seventy percent are without power at this time we were slowly been increasing that number but we're looking for a\nSort of a large surge if you would say starting on friday night possibly Saturday morning where a several power transformers and things are going to go into place and we should get a large number of people getting power at that point\nPark says emergency officials and liberty have had to put out some fire stemming from mishaps as power has turned back on\nWe had several fires occur from people having their stoves on and then they hatch sex stuff on the stove that gives it was being used and then out those things ignited and costs house fires\nAnd with much of the counties still without power food options have been scarce Claire Martin who works with Christian Aid ministries drove straight to Florida with a caravan of volunteers the day Michael hit they sang hymns if they give out food at Bristol Christian Church\nThere's a lot of elderly people\nWho don't have power for their oxygen and all of it for me to have received so much of that where [noise]\nUh there's the electric the big deal when that goes [noise] we just lose so much\nAfter the interview Martin said he was going to offer condolences to a bristle resident who

dollars to go to those stores and buy food right now they're broke I mean lost everything slumps\nTown is in Calhoun County just over the border from liberty their residents have banded together to help feed each other\nBetween using their own food and resources and stretching the outside help that's come in they've managed to have hot meals each day Steve Bailey is a former blondes towns city council member who has been up at the crack of dawn every day since the storm helping organize feeding his community at first the only food to be had came from the residents themselves\nWe brought it in a way of hours after the storm I guess it's sort of thing people before anybody else could get here and pretty much what we've fed it would be the first three days was people's freezers stuff that was going to ruin anyway so we had fish and deer and wild hog and all that stuff now we're starting to get donations of beef and pork and that we're able to cook for everybody chicken\nAs liberty county makes headway getting power back a county over Bailey says Calhoun anticipate the longer wait\nWe lost a hundred percent of our ... our transmission lines coming in are going to be at least another week getting a fear when we do crank up here we should have Fifteen twenty percent of our grid up by them thanks to all these guys that come in from out of town and help us Bailey\nFears the more than one billion dollars in timbre loss in the region will bring closed plans in jobs lost but right now watching his neighbors come together has changed his perspective\nYou know I I Will make our religion in this but I haven't seen God and the\nChurch in a long time I've seen him on his foreigner for a loan for a week now solidly\nFor Florida public radio I'm Ryan daily\nFlorida and the U.S continue to grapple with the aftermath of hurricane Michael Orlando based economic analyst Hank fish kind says that along with the storms devastating human toll there will also be a significant and long lasting financial impact\nFish guides says Michael will be one of the ten most costly hurricanes on record economist at Moody's Analytics estimate Michael's financial toll at between Fifteen and Twenty one billion dollars but fish guide tells WMA at these new called dark and crushed and why he thinks the numbers ultimately will be higher\nWell it's a direct impact area from Mexico beach to Panama City suffered severe damage to most every single building and its infrastructure was severely impacted\nNow in a wider area especially on the eastern side where the storm surge and tidal surge was the greatest\nAh there was massive damage to property and to the infrastructure and tend to live for space was nearly totally destroy not temple is a major engine of economic growth in that part of the world so I think that the damage is going to be significantly above the Moody's estimate\nNow how does the economic damage from Michael ...\nWell I'm a law saying much much bigger storm and it hit the densely populated areas throughout most of the peninsula Florida so does damage to property and to the economy top fifty billion compared to my estimate of about twenty five billion for Michael\nBut the economy a peninsula Florida is much more robust than is the economy in and around Panama City in the rural panhandle areas that were directly impacted\nAnd also despite its huge size Irma had much lower wins and so it had much less impact in terms of the places that hit and it certainly didn't kill as many people so so arm it did far less damage to the power grid into the roadways\nAnd therefore a recovery could happen much more quickly\nOr not so for Michael aware it hit it destroyed the communications infrastructure though the power in roadways themselves and it's going to take months to restore a and for that area to begin to even have some semblance of normalcy\nPower's back on and Tallahassee but power is not going to be back on and parts of Panama City or Mexico beach\nFor a month or more and you know it's going to have devastating impacts on the economy along with that loss of tend to labor force base which is going to be calls for a year or more\nThis is a difficult conversation to hang ... continuing to focus on the economic aspects can you give me some examples of the types of economic damage that will linger in the county area\nYeah you know based on our recent experience from Irma\nIt's going to take a year or so for many tourist related businesses to reopen\nAnd many all never reopen and that's why we saw happen in the keys and you know in ... city and a ... and that's going to be replicated up in Mexico beach in a a cross much of that a direct impact area\nThe economic disruption is huge or if we think back to when Andrew hit home state Airforce base on the air force they never reopened as an air force base and it took a decade for recovery to to really begin there\nAnd so we're going to have that same kind of problem meal tend to last for space supports a huge economy and the economy's in jeopardy\nAnd the rural larger agricultural areas in northeast Florida in southeast Georgia would badly damaged\nIt's gonna be a long time before the economy in that area recovers I mean we're talking years Nicole regrettably what about even further out well further out this going to be consequences to this I mean the recent increase in hurricane frequency and intensity\nWilling evidently boost property insurance rates in Florida and across the country\nAnd I think over the next ten years those rates will rise sufficiently to begin to affect the market value of coastal real estate in Florida and that could have very significant consequences for development activities and also for the tax revenues throughout the state of Florida\nSo these are trends that are going to occur and we need to start planning for these eventuality cynical how would we do that\nWell a number of things we can begin to move development increasingly away from the high hazard areas we can begin to increase the insurance costs and other regulations so that we don't have an abrupt cliff effect\nYou know all of a sudden one day nobody wants to write insurance that's a very abrupt change it would be much better to do this gradually\nEven the ... will be painful but some graduate changing rates and regulations is what's called for a nickel thank you very much\nFor your time thank thank you [noise] has Florida economists Hank fish kind speaking with W ... called Arden crushed\nStill to come on Capitol reports the storm what's become boss just state wide political campaigns at least for a little while\nSo we cancelled our fundraisers and what I did is I had public rallies scheduled yesterday and today we converted those tend to supply Dr\nAmong the ... election issues facing voters this election cycle an amendment casting crime victims rights into constitutional concrete not everyone thinks it's a
