Hi Mary Louise\nSo the G R U has been around for a century since ... around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution but safe to say for a lot of us here in America the first time we heard about that one was twenty sixteen\nThat's correct from the election hacking but these are very busy guys and girls um\nThey have been involved in this ongoing case of two G. argue agents the alleged agents who are accused of poisoning Sergei Skripal and Britain he's a former G R U agent himself who had had a ... swap was living in Britain\nThe difference though this case is filled with lots of glaring almost comedic screw up some first of all ... and his daughter survived the attack in March which was was clearly not the intent\nThan assassination attempt that did not manage to assassinate the two people who were being targeted and go on that is correct\nAnd the two suspects were seen on the security cameras which are all over Britain and then the suspects go ... are back in Russia and they make this very strange appearance on on Russian television to explain what they were doing in solitary but it got to\nFill the quota\nThere are blaming their explain that solve their is beautiful town and they were just tourists and of course if you were going to to England you would make a trip to\nSee this tower it's a hundred and twenty three meters high um and then they said well it was cold and flashy and so they turned around after a couple of days and and headed back to Russia\nOkay so fast forward to this month to October and to some equally questionable spy craft on display and then other ones right\nAnd so this is sort of the follow up the Dutch announced that just last week that they've caught for they say gee argue agents\nAh with high tech equipment in a rental car outside the office for the prohibition of chemical weapons which was testing the chemicals apparently used in the attack back in March\nUm now they were caught in a rental car they apparently tried to smash some of this equipment one of the phones or was apparently traced to a G R U headquarters in Moscow had only been used a couple of days earlier I'm even found a receipt for a taxi or from\nThe barracks to the airport in Moscow it sounds so clumsy it almost makes you wonder if they wanted to be caught or at least didn't care if they were ...\nI think what we could say is they really don't seem to care if they're caught the Russians just deny deny deny on there is no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of actions\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions by we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise]\nUm so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents garden ... thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent any tax have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nProblem is is that there is no tentative conclusion other than the Russians face was ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIt is likely so they would troubling underwriters says I'm visa ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling cat\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works taller and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operations unfold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Capital Report", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "12"}
