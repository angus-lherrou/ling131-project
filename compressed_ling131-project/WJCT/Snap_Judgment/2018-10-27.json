like what is the season\nWho used to finally hear snap judgments electrifying Halloween seniors continues ... ten\nCreepy crawly [noise]\nReal people real stories of the paranormal right after this short break be afraid to stay [noise]\n\nAll of us damp from sweat\nIt was like you to cool off immediately\nYou\nKnow such was the community people often with inside the funeral home to see people they barely knew what I heard about or maybe they were infamous in some ways that's the person who got fuel Robin something\nThat's the the guy who ran over on his bike in front of a funeral home\nSo people often just went in to see people they didn't have to know that when I was real calm and\nThe people who ran the home as soon as they knew that a lot of times we recovered just to get out they had one kind of unwritten rules you couldn't come in [noise] unless you were interviewing\nCouldn't just be hanging uh you you could go interviewing which meant that we had to sit and look at a body\nWe would do it we wouldn't want to\nBut we all do that so many times we knew what the rules of the game to\n\nHim about twelve years old when distorted and\nIt was late summer and it was it was hot\nThey'll probably one of the hottest days [noise]\nAnd we all piled into their own rationally adjust based [noise] playing ball outside and [noise] what was unusual about that is\nI kicked the ball and the way across the street toward this fence when it's like crazy do live to snap snarl or anything [noise] got near that [noise] oh my God it's going to go in the yard [noise]\nAnd all of a sudden this kid just came out of nowhere and slapped the ball down [noise] and he said today [noise]\nIn the moment that had happened not one of us even said\nWho is as do is because he looked like us but this particular kid he was with none of us and that's when we first met him\nWe'd all went inside and the funeral home were sitting on the road like we normally would do\nAnd he was sitting with us and he didn't speak and we weren't speaking because we weren't supposed to so he was being unusually quiet was just par for the course but when we got up and we left\nA couple of us were saying how he could play good what's his name oh\nI think he's who easy\n[noise]\nSo this war started turning up all the time we were playing [noise] none of us to remember him ever being there when we would start a game [noise]\nWhen we were trying to meet to get together it would always be in the heat of the gay [noise]\nWhen all of us were thinking about nothing but the game kicking the ball throwing the ball chasing each other being on a bike racing around the corner [noise]\nThat'd be one more of us\nBrown skin I'd say two inch afro not much of a pro war short sleeved shirts and that button at all nothing underneath the cut off pants [noise]\nTennis shoes and no stop [noise]\nHere to speak\nBut I Would say something like or do you want to go up the street or do you want to stay here I Would give him possible options he wouldn't nod or shoulder shrug cabinet expression on his face\nReason why none of us went into great depth about why he didn't speak\nIs because in our community there were several kids and adults who had this kind of disability [noise]\nThis was an era where people with a developmental delays they didn't get treated at all I saw lots of kids coming out of the country who\nDidn't speak couldn't speak with me\nUh that that wasn't so uncommon I probably knew a half a dozen kids like that [noise]\n\nOne day me and the kid was hanging out in the alley and I was looking at pictures flying around the funeral home [noise]\nI had to ... he was saying I liked pigeons\nSo I took him to my house to see my pitches\n[noise]\nI got introduced to pigeons razor just when I was maybe ten years old [noise]\nPut 'em on your arm or something and give them a brain of corn and it was cool they relax you could you could rub their back and they were squatting down raise their feathers up [noise] pull their wings up in the air and spread\n'em and then when they wouldn't fly off [noise] and to be able to walk out into the street with 'em and toss 'em up in the air and watching the sale at a distance and it comes back to you [noise] that was that was the magic you made a bird comeback team [noise]\nSo I was raising a pigeons in a makeshift who but built in the\nBack of our house where I live with my mom and my step dad [noise] and I'm like most of the kids we didn't have any real\nFormal coup so we make a model piece of plywood bulls signs and posters even old television sets [noise]\nThere's one type of picking called rollers the rollers are different in that they have this habit\nOf slipping in the air we call a role in but what they're really doing is flipping\n[noise]\nThe effect of that is the pigment would be flying and it would be like he stopped flying in mid air as start falling out of the sky that's what it looks like and they flip flip the better ones will do that almost two they hit the around and come back up [noise] it's\nIt's a marvelous thing to see and we would jump up and down and scream and holler at clap our hands are encouraged them to\nTo roll and you it'd be a bunch of us stand around flip and scream and holler [noise]\nCome on come on come on slapping a hands together come on come on come on all of us had different calls for opinions\nThese pages were off financially out of our means rural poor kids\nPicturing like that would probably cost six dollars\nIn Nineteen I'm Seventy two Seventy three\nWe were okay with the bird you could get but if you had a roller you know up to that point I hadn't had any rose\nSees [noise]\nWe're in the back yard he's really excited and he's comfortable with his you know he knew how to hold them the right way the way he smiles too with all the way you touched on this fresh new way for\nHow they were comfortable with him\nThe way he walked around the coup and pool that my why you're\nAnd looked at my nails and he smiled at me and we walked around the look to see what I was the\nMoment but the one thing [noise] I couldn't\nGet from him then was where you from\n[noise] where you stand man who you know folks here who you relate to what school you go to who is you know and he would give me nothing\nWe would hang out more and more we do more walking through the back alleys would spend more time in my backyard\nAnd one thing in particular happened [noise]\nWe're walking through the alley [noise] I Know a lot of the alleys were dominated\nBy adults smoke street dog that would just take over an alley and this was one of those cases\nAnd we've both just took off [noise]\n\nRan and ran and I didn't look back to see what the dog we do and I got about two blocks away and I was out of breath and then we got away we did it we're together we boys refine station we friends now\nThey do when I was he even read it hard\n[noise] but [noise] it wasn't there [noise]\nI didn't see him again to the next day [noise]\nFor the first time\nI was starting to feel funny about him and that didn't make sense\nIt was scary it's like you disappeared you weren't there was no place to go [noise]\nI wanted to see him so badly the next day\nI was in the backyard with the pages had turned around and daddy was\nAnd we went he went to the coup like she normally would do\nI had to ask him way\nWe do anything else were we play what what happened to you yesterday where did you go\nWhen I mentioned to my mother about this boy to come and go and disappeared in ...\nMy mother immediately told me stay away from [noise]\nJust said stay away from she was afraid [noise]\nWas it like I had a lot of friends [noise]\nRoadkill for years I could probably stuff a squirrel in my sleep [noise]\nUntil one day my mom texted me hey I found a new squirrel it's tied up in a dog\nTo bag in the freezer so after work I I rushed home and it was really glad that I did because the bag that was actually just sitting there open which doesn't bother me but Nate would've flipped so I put it on my in my workstation out on the back porch\n[noise]\nI get a good hard look at the animal I kind of wait for them to\nSpeak to me and lack of a better word and see what is unique about them [noise]\nIt was gorgeous as far as roadkill goes it didn't have any broken bones it didn't have led it didn't have [noise]\nLeaves and maggots\nWhy isn't ants in it [noise]\nIt was really in good shape [noise]\nThat had really nice brown for and\nThe whole thing was kind of golden brown but the tip of its tail was white\n[noise]\nNormally a specimen this perfect is a home run but there was something about this particular squirrel\nThat looking at it just made my skin crawl and I couldn't exactly explain why I felt uncomfortable\n[noise]\nI just it was almost like I had this no no no no no kind of drowning it out it felt more like being screamed at honestly\nIt was frozen solid but it\nAlmost look like it could\nPop up and run up the tree\nAs I was looking at the squirrel I was just\nWould be horrible intrusive\nThoughts [noise] you're just got to take what are you doing what are you thinking about\nRight now\nSo I had been struggling with these thought and I picked up the squirrels and I picked up the exact a knife and I always start the incision right between the shoulder blades or you know below at the base of its neck and then you know and you go from the shoulder blades down to the tail bones\n[noise]\nAs soon as I pressed the tip of the exact fell into the\nSkin I felt that go in a tiny bit [noise]\nTwitch [noise] ah it was just a fraction of a second\nI I definitely saw it that clip them flick that little shiver and it startled me so I I dropped the world and the nice and I expected it to jump up and run away [noise]\n\nI Hope that and convinced myself that\nIt was a dead squirrel like I mean obviously it was a damn squirrel [noise]\nI still myself picturesque world backup got the exact blade and\nLike ripping off a band aid I just I stuck with a knife in and dragged it down the spine line [noise]\n[noise]\nHi Ruth my hands and the blade got it to the point where I can get my hands around its stomach in between the skin and the body [noise] and then I started working its little arms five just popping them backwards through the skin and got skinned out so it was almost like\nIt was wearing a one Z. of its own skin [noise] and the final part\nWas a cutting the lip [noise]\nI suddenly had a really sharp pain [noise] underneath the knuckle the pinky on my right hand [noise]\nI drop this girl I dropped the blade\nAnd I look at my hands [noise]\nGlove had actually been torn open\nAnd underneath that there were four short rats marks on my skin on really close together [noise]\nSo I took off the damage was and as I was doing that [noise]\nI noticed a little tiny bit of movement in this little visions do I look back up at the world [noise]\nAnd it was lying on the table [noise]\nAnd I saw the four\nFingers on its pong slowly curl up into a little fist hold for a second and then really slowly relax [noise]\nYeah that's me up [noise] I just I panicked [noise]\nI can explain that whatever that's just my own brain [noise]\nBeing a deck [noise] having a a\nSquirrel paw wound on my hand was much harder to explain away\nMaybe I put too much pressure on the brain and that sent a signal through the dead muscles to make the paw flick and it caught my glove just write that has to be it because the only other explanation\nIs that I just skin to the squirrel alive [noise]\n\nIt did occur to me several times to just stop\nIt felt like I was going to be heard from that point on to never have\nAnother good experience with taxidermy which would be devastating\nLike what if I'm done what if it's going to be like this with every animal from now on\nI got as far as picking everything up to throw it out but\nHad given up it would have been a huge step backwards I hopped on a new glove clipped the wrists and the uh ankles off the carcass I buried it in a plastic tub under about ten pounds of salt\nAnd put her on the shelf underneath my ah underneath my bedroom window and went to bed and\n[noise]\nI could barely sleep that night because the scratch just was thriving and every time it thrived I thought about the world [noise]\n\nThe next morning I woke up and all I had to have a chance to solve it can't possibly get as weird as it was yesterday [noise]\nBig bag of salt outside when I open the tub that had the skin inside\nThe skin was sitting\nUp halfway out of the salt as if it hits for road up for air like I'd been solemn be getting up from its grave [noise]\nIt was just sitting there\nStaring at me with these empty aisle with [noise]\nThe ties kind of\nSticking up reaching out [noise]\nThere's no way the\nDead holiday world pushed its way up to ten pounds though there was also no way that anybody has touched it because\nThey all think it's disgusting [noise]\n\nI just dumped out the salt buried again put it on the shelf and\nWalked away from it for I expected it to be a a very long time\n[noise]\nOne morning while I was finishing my coffee I heard a squirrel start barking [noise]\n\nAnd I for a second I throws because I'm thinking oh my God it's bits back it wants revenge but it was just another squirrel outside\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nI just felt sad thinking that you know well dang this world that I was [noise]\nSo afraid of [noise] it also used to nibble and caper and get her and learn and [noise] um [noise] bearing nuts and it just kind of just kind of all hit me that this was a living thing and it had I don't know\nDignity I went\nBack to the salt tablets and uh you know the ... was actually still in there and it hadn't uh\nTrying to escape again [noise] but I just opened it up\nI felt like I owe to an apology and I started talking to it so I said look I'm Sorry I didn't listen because I think that you were telling me to stop before I even started\nThe only thing that I Want to do is preserve you
