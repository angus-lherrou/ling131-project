[noise] do you watch the studios stepped up on the ground later you may towards when she was she [noise] not [noise]\nBe rain to weaken the dark side snap judgment right after this short break [noise] day [noise]\n\nAs Katie's said what he\nSaw as Katie or a small kill team or sniper killed team\n[noise] like the basic tactical would be we would leave the fall of very very late at night in trucks\nRoll around the neighborhood with the lights down for several hours the trucks would slow down to a crawl and we were trying like a silently open the doors just said ... from the truck without slamming anything or making any noise\nWalk through the neighborhood as ... as you can we reached like the\nTarget house [noise] basically from there you just just break in\nAnd then a set of hide and just pull over watch over the sector and just wait basically for someone to do something a grimy like digging a hole to bury an ID\nAnd then uh we respond accordingly\nWould have probably at least six hours notice that we were going to be a step\nOff generally before heading out on whether I think the thing is that you would fear like you remember anything about those moments\nBut I can remember one time and it ended up becoming a pre mission ritual 'cause ... had a really great sound system and he'd be like do are about to get pumped up for this mission press play [noise]\nBeing in the ... decibels just cranking made out then the jets became more anthems [noise]\n\n... like your [noise] hundred and twenty pounds worth of kids and scrambled to the top of the truck pitcher weapon mounted [noise]\nJust scanning scanning like a maniac\nWhen you're moving across open ground mall scanning\nSweating profusely\nFeminine like I I notice public radio says analogy would probably never make it on air but it really is like just doing a fat rail [noise]\nTo have eight guys moving in a in a file\nThrough a neighborhood if it's the point of the mission where you're most expose where you're most vulnerable\nYou have to maintain almost complete silence because aside from the sound of the wind maybe some dogs barking there is no sound\nLike so for Seventy two hours straight slide basically like I'm being in church because any sounds could like compromise you and potentially get everybody that you love killed\nAt the moment that this story takes place\nHow long had you been in country or how many of these missions have you been on this\nSo this was probably the seventh or eighth mission that I'd been on the mission started out typically it felt completely the same as any other mission\nSo it's probably like a around midnight or one in one or two o'clock in the morning we approached the building and before I've even gotten like a chance to drop my rock\nLike my best friend comes up to me and ah he just looks really shook him up [noise]\n\nAnd he's like do there's something wrong here there's just something bizarre so immediately walking in this place is the first thing that I noticed was this sound [noise]\nDescendants knowing it sounded almost like a broken radio interview [noise] down the hall [noise]\nJust [noise]\nDisquieting on hold for\nAlmost sounded like a congregation of whispers\nLike thousands of voices trying to communicate something but in a completely non political\nLike something was really different\nDecided that you know is going to look around some of the upper floors\nSo as I was walking around like that the second story I came into this one room that it was\nCompletely stripped bare simple the meant\nMore [noise] I don't know ... to some too but I turned to face the interior or [noise]\nThe wall was pockmarked with bullet home with around so I was standing there looking at these pockmarked wall it just seemed like something wasn't right that these they weren't\nMy squad leader and showed me this like pencil trick you can in certain like a pencil and into like small arms fire against a wall\nTell you like the direction that the fire it come from\nThis being the second story I put the pencil into the wall and it's a very little to the ground just sticking in like\nIt meant that\nThose shots had been fired straight across\nVery soon as I step them pencil and everything fell into place\nThis had to have been killed room but they had to lined people up\nIn here and just executed them [noise] and I just felt a little keys in my stomach [noise] standing in a kill house [noise]\nInstantly just felt like the walls just collapsed in on themselves don't really claustrophobic and I just needed to get them out of the room\nIt seemed like there was a maligned presence there [noise]\nThat was trying to get\nSomebody killed and it was totally inexplicable you have to imagine that all of\nThis is under the backdrop under the soundtrack of this just just for\nJust this ever present oral presidents\nThis feeling that you are feeling well we're all the ice really didn't know what that like a palpable and like anxiety in the air\nThere's like a there's an under current of tension [noise]\n\nIt wasn't like a we all huddled together in a circle enter trading this back and forth there was people would pair off with their best friend and be like do you would not believe what just happened nobody's going to talk about that because you're showing weakness\nI think that if one person were to stand up and be like goes kind of scary we would have written them apart [noise]\nSo we're left with all of this downtime and so you have now like half a dozen twenty year old children and one of the number one pastimes on these as Katie's is looting someone is like hey there's a storage unit down first floor\nAnd that immediately became something that all of us jumped onto because it it gives you a chance I guess like um to prove that you're not afraid to know goes to prove that you're not scared\nAs soon as that call goes out like yeah you know what yeah yeah hell yeah man all all all route through these people\nThat I Know business and it's almost like a an affront to whatever was there it was just like a a gated off a unit or on the first floor and I walked over\nThere and he ended up really him basically like a storage space I mean exactly like a storage space and there's just a very simple symmetrical wrought iron gate on front\n[laughter]\nThose wrought iron gates are so loud that three of us walked up and got really low to the ground and just grab the gay on the bottom and just live a quarter inch\nAnd then quietly walk backwards so that the gates not rubbing against the ground so that it wouldn't be allowed at all\nWe left the gate like prop all the way up and [noise]\nSo I think about half a dozen of us go into this a\nUnit [noise] a turntable\nShares closing decorations silverware all\nKinds of things it smells like dust old\nAnd it's pitch black\nSo I came out of that gay in a mixture of rage and terror\nIn immediately\nThought out like my best friend just unload on him [noise]\nAnd I get to him and I was like in a whisper in in whisper mode like what the hell is wrong with you do why would you do that\nShe had no idea what I was talking about forest he was concerned we went and checked it out everybody came out all in together and that was it\n\nAt this point I'd been in the building for maybe eight hours I'm ready to go home now this is a very not been a pleasant experience for me I imagine\nThat for some people that would be really easy to dismiss this like as nerves or you know like the stress like a battle yeah trauma things like that but the thing to keep in mind about that is this was one of maybe fifty missions\nThat I went out on but nothing ever like this nothing ever that came so close that was so blatant like a a force\n[noise] or as the sun comes up the gun trucks pull up and we exit the building [noise]\nThis is how just stupid\nYou are at Twenty years old those paintings they stayed in Iraq I brought those things that\nSo I'm back in my room\nIn the barracks and uh take these things out and I'm like hey check out these coup paintings that I got in a ... our platoon medic is in there and he's like I I Would very much like to have that and I'm like no way to know this is my decoration I went through the haunted house for this this is my prize I'm keeping it thank you sir\nSir cagey leaves and Sam comes in one of our ... one of our interpreters Sam and I was like what the hell is up with that place dude like it's really really weird and he's like oh yeah like that places unclean [noise]\nIt's an clean he's like very many people died in that building so it's an clean and no one goes there [noise]\nIt really are\nBrought home to me what had happened [noise]\n\nAnd it's such a\nThing to admit it's like it's such a bad thing but I picked up the painting and that was like hey do you guys know where to go and he went way I Want to you know what I found cagey and I was like here man I Know this is really special to you\nI'd really like for you to have this and I gave it away\nIt part of new ideas I'm hearing it for\n'em fighting back in a way that that had no military um\nThat wouldn't come into way way later now looking back all of these years later I have a lot of respect for whatever that thing was it was able to scare me\nI felt like any ways like I I got my come up at five months after\nThis whole episode in may is when I got hit by a ... or car bomb [noise]\nEven the fear was not as scary as that experience for the simple fact that I felt like if I caught around in the noodle I'd be dead if I got ripped apart by an explosion I'd be dead\nBut whatever was inside of that structure\nIt felt like if you were to die in its presence that it would have like a completely different set of consequences\nThan if you were to died just a out insect or somewhere like a you could become like a trapped\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBank using data Sanchez for sharing your story
