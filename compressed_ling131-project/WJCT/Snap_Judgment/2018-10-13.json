understand I'm just glad that we're getting to talk\nYou do need to know that ... are already on line saying that this didn't happen he said what are ... they said okay\nI saw like wow you're kidding me so what are you crazy\nMitch asked her to stop by their house the following day\nWhich was on board with the Phillip says on the guy had a different take on total strangers stopping by their house I was more maybe more skeptical like nervous of a wire they hear what's their agenda\nHow can people come and meet with us if they don't want something from us her house was so crowded that the only private place to talk with her bedroom\nOn a good match that on the bad\nMoney and Sandy and chairs\nAnd I can remember seeing a little uncomfortable and thinking to herself\nWhy am I sitting here why not mine I with a family who are these people I don't know them but I I guess it might help but it was very overwhelming like I Can't believe that I have to sit that have this conversation what is this is my life now you know\nWas there a point in the conversation where it started to turn for you\nYeah I think I think when they when they said don't to join our organization now don't side now just take care of yourself\nLet yourself believe they ask questions about neck and\nBefore long they were just talking [laughter] money remembers Mitch asking if they were religious and if they ever got signed from Jesse he told me that that like them they weren't but they took eleven eleven as a low from Jessie\nThe conversation went on for three hours you know all our\nFriends and family as much as they did for us and how much love they showed\nNone of them could have any clue what we were failing and hear what you people knowing exactly what we're feeling\nThey also made me feel a little more confident is I don't know if that's the right word you're in a club we all know want to be and we didn't want to meet you we wish we would have met on the different circumstances but you have people help you with this kind of grief [noise]\nAnd a few days later when the online conspiracies started appearing about neck that he didn't exist or that he was living in California\nThey remembered Sandy's morning\nIt was still upsetting\nBut less upsetting because they knew it was coming they helped in other ways to\nThe door it took the Philips has advice and gotten to trauma therapy right away\nBoth individually and as a family\nThey're younger son Alex has done through a lot neck was his best friend one of the last things neck that on the day of the shooting was walk Alex too it's English class Alex was injured in the shooting and sat by a kid who died right in front of him on a case of managing her grief along with her son's has been tough\nIt was so much attention on Nick Nick Nick Nick Nick everybody came for Nick flowers for for next to let us or make I felt like you know I I\nIf this didn't happen to Nicholas and only this I could have been there for ...\nSo much stronger and so much more so I I was afraid that he would get neglected and all that\nI think sometimes children feel like\nWell you must have loved that child more than you love me Benny\nSon was twenty five when his sister died then he tried to talk to him about it which ended up pushing him farther away don't you talk to parents talking about her own mistakes to\nWhat your [noise]\nEight months after they first met which is still in touch with Sandy talks or call each other every couple of weeks Mr live on Sandy more than ... who and like him already has a built a network of friends she talks to all the time\nAnd then we texted I think we texted yesterday it was eleven eleven actually was actually yesterday\nAnd I feel like she's still in it you know she's still with us She's it's someone who we can lean on\nAnd and give us support and I in turn when I heard a lean on me maybe you know seeing us get stronger it gives her energy to\nHe's right about that Sandy spends almost every day at a tiny kitchen table or trailer fielding tax and phone calls from survivors and messaging with people on social media laugh for help the pain\nIs always there at the end of the day and when you go to bed at night when you first wake up in the morning it's there but you have a sense of purpose and that\nThat helps a little bit of a lifeline or some old ... total lifeline total you know if I didn't have this work I don't think I'd be alive I really don't and I say that to Loni all the timing us that you know don't you love me and this kind of thing to stay alive so I just don't think I Would have had\nThe ability to keep going [noise]\nWhich ... told me that when they're feeling stronger she'd like to do for other families with the Philips has done for

were asleep on the class and are too poor to ledges that them Tommy ... and John and I were in the other about six Fifteen in the morning kind of is the first ... started to fill this guy in the morning like gunshot cracked off\nIt was rattling ways scary when the bullet hit the wall Fifteen feet away so we all kinda got shower of Iraq fragments you can't run away the port alleges are made of fabric on the bottom so you're half expecting bulletin just revenue from the from the bottom up\nA second gunshot went off and at that point I can see that there was three people at the base of the class that we were on\nJohn Dickey the photographer he had a long camera lens that he put it on his camera and he looked down and he can see the scary looking guys I'm with the guns and they were there were waving to uh to come down and say John went ahead and volunteered to go down first\nAnd then he almost immediately radio that to me and he said hey these guys\nAre they really like for you to come down and have a talk\nAs soon as I got to the ground was green\nBy these two gentlemen who were wearing camouflage clothing or one of them had of Patagonia Gore Tex jacket on and some really nice climbing sunglasses and he had a tube of Colgate and the Colgate toothbrush in as an of a pockets on his best that he was actually quite proud of\nHe's in first thought was that these men were banned it but they didn't act like bandits they shook his hand and introduce themselves\nThere was a commander who uh called himself Abdul there was the guy with the Gore Tex jacket and sunglasses who is called ... and he was just overtly friendly um he was grinning from ear to ear really happy to meet us\nThey they seem to have pretty chill attitudes but they had big guns and so they're they're just basically like follow us\nNot to let them back to the Base Camp the climbers had just set up a few days earlier they watch just a handful\nOf armed men were rifling through their supplies\n... directed them to sit down next to another hostage and then in the military uniform they recognized as the cookies officer would shoot their travel permit\nBut I didn't immediately register that in fact um because when he stood up to make room for me to sit on his Rob\nI'm I noticed that he was covered from the waist down in blood he was completely saturated\nStarted pointing to the blood on his pants [noise] yeah it was it was\nThe curies off his name was drawn and he was signaling to them secretly that these kidnappers had already killed three other cookies officers\nI think he saw the look on my face which was probably Ashton\nAny held up three fingers and many he swipe one finger across his throat\nIt seemed as if a blues men were not ... there was some kind of militant rebel and they were preparing to move the whole group somewhere else\nAnd if they want to move somewhere that means they have to be somewhat kind to us we didn't have a lot of things that we were going to be able to exploit and that was one of them we can export cooperation our level of cooperation\nDuring his men broke down camp took all the supplies that could carry and began to march everyone at gunpoint over the terrain the climbers and the other hostage trot had no choice but to obey\nAnd then suddenly above them\nThere was a new even deadly or threat\nCourteous helicopters military helicopters started to fly around overhead and that's when\nEverything changed\nIt got really frantic\nIn what had been a silent Himalayan valley just a few hours earlier a firefighter wrapped\nUp till pointed out to the helicopter in mind\nGo hide or we will shoot the to the hostages ... crossing the brush suddenly they were dodging bullets from every which way\nThe helicopter was shooting from above and Marjory soldiers crusted hill and we're closing in on the rebels who are also returning fire\nThere's a lot a machine gun fire they had this kind of things that started to fly\nThere's these murders and shoot it and you'd have this whistling noise and you hear it coming towards\nThere'd be an explosion [noise]\nI'm told that the hostages to the brush exacting from tree to tree they ran for our ups and downs sharp steep gorges alongside fast moving river\nAnd so we kind of escape the on the line of sight of the soldiers um and we weren't running across as plateau to the adjacent valley\nTruck came over and sat next to me\nAnd he put his hand on my knee any squeezed it really really tightly and he looked me right in the face and he pointed across as valley and he said I'm going to die over there\nAnd I kind of did what I think anybody would do which is to lie to him and to tell them that we were all in this situation together and everything can it be okay and\nUh he told me to shut up and he said listen to me\nI'm going to die over there and that means that you need to do something about the situation\nOnly moments later a blues men motion for the group to move behind a large Boulder\nOut that Boulder where they whistled at us and told us he got one of the time in ... was the first one to go I'm so ... went up there and then as soon as he got there they shot him one blinking that oh\nThe four of us um had to come up after that and sort of walk around the Boulder and see him lying there was a pool of blood coming out of his head and then we had to basically crouching lay on top of his body for the next hour or two until we finally fled the fighting the battle\nNights out\nAnd the adrenaline was starting to wear off\nThey finally got up to this rich where [noise]\nUm we were able to stop and sit down\nAnd\nWe had we had a break and there was kind of a very strange feeling\nThe crossfire it was on the helicopter was gone but their food water and supplies for also gone\nAnd so we ended up with just a few things in our pockets which I think there's a power bars\nOr a three musketeers bar\n... scattered during the firefight\nNow there was only three men left up to himself to the shy one and oh back to finally won\nOver at a few pieces of hard candy that he shared heap all five of them out of pocket any kind of looked around and the other people other than himself and you could see him doing the math and he ended up taking one of the pieces and giving my friends that I the other four pieces\nAnd I think that for me that was the moment I knew that we could be that if we just played our cards right\nUp till had relaxed a little bit the climbers we're no longer at gunpoint and there was an unspoken agreement that everyone stay together that is until they came to this river [noise]\nFast raging river and they were having a hard time with it they started trying to take this just fallen trees\nAnd get it across the river to make a bit of a bridge and\nJason I'm decided that this moment that he was going to help and I didn't understand why\nI swam and I'm like a cat and the water so I Would actually terrified so I just committed I charged out there and I just grabbed\nThe log and [noise]\nPlowed into this regime for water was like almost getting swept away barely able to hold on to the law\nAnd I got about three quarters away across and ah I ended up setting off the older I'm finding into the main current and that was right at the top of a waterfall\nThought to myself like a nice word idiot because now you're going to have relatively drowned in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely soaked but also get the get the log across the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAnd I'm sure came over and I was reaching out my hand in trying to grab his hand in ... when the rock and he was terrified of rocking law [noise]\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand\nAnd I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out they gave me his rifle\nI was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I'm very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he was patting me on the back and asking me if\nA soldier they looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like this trial\nAnd then they like padding among the sub shoulder and they're like sold like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars and\nThe dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nNews Sioux who they had all seen fall to his death was alive [noise]\nAnd I said that's impossible that it's completely impossible [noise]\nUm I saw this guy fly into the air in front of me in the ground and\nLet out this horrible exploding found go tumbling off again [noise]\nJohnson fan is just is not possible\nAnd then a fax us or a photograph that the army and sent through that was clearly [noise] and yeah I was astounded I'll never understand how he survives\nI remember um being happy that he had died for sure but really what pay me more about that I you know I had the capacity I sort of had this like evil inside of me that allowed me to kill I think most people\nWonder if they were put in a live or die situation like this with they'd be able to react\nAnd I did like I was able to react in a way that saved our lives and so that there's always been somewhat empowering but you know I still didn't you know I didn't want to kill anybody I still would never want to kill anybody\nUm so I was I was happy to do that\nSo Jason and John flew back to Kurdistan and they were actually granted a meeting with the cookies minister of defense\nSo since the ministry of defense and right in front of me I just went ahead and threw it out there and said hey random able to ... visual name as a Ruslan ... um\nAnd he said yeah sure I mean we're in now go ten minutes from now\nThan they ... into the room and\nShe or he walked in the room and he saw us and he smiled and\nUh we had and we he gave us a big handshake and then we sat down and had a sort of brief an awkward conversation\nA missed the first time we've been able to talk with an interpreter and we apologize I said hey sorry about that whole like you know off the cliff kind of thing and he I kind of laugh when I said sorry about pushing them off a cliff any kind of shrugged his shoulders as smart as I get it done the same thing [noise]\nUm and I guess for me that was probably the most valuable part of that interaction and the most viable ...\nWalk away with it\nI knew that he was facing the death penalty for half a dozen different charges you know invading a foreign country taking people kept to all the kinds of things and I felt really sorry for him he was\nA Nineteen year old car really had a real innocent kind of air about him I didn't want to say anything in front of the army that might contribute to him getting the death penalty\nA [noise] and then know\nUm it just seems to me like that's how the circle of violence continues\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nThank you Jason snip in Tommy Caldwell was sharing that story
