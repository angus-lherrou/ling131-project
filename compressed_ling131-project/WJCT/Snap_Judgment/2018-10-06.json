[noise]\nI'm taking my life not out of despair but simply because I've said everything I wanted to say and consider my work finished\nSince no one at present and are in the past half century as interested I have no platform upon which to stand and talk about my work in this regard I Believe I have an immense amount to guess not only from my mind but from my heart and there's just no takers I'm sixty six years old now\nYes I'm disappointed that the books go unnoticed but I also know that such a thing is an unusual in the world of ideas\nI'm not asking anything if you but just hoping that

says well colon wrote to Cynthia specifically is because he read something she wrote for the Washington Post that stuck with him\nHe seems Ernest when he says that he is in reaching out for attention but as one last effort to get his work scene\nBut it was the first sign I'm writing because this is my last day on earth that rang to Cynthia had [noise]\nAt first I thought well okay let me researching [noise]\nAs I realized that it was someone who really was potentially going exist and first of all and was going to do this I actually started to get for a somewhat angry\nBut I thought who does those who does this to a total stranger and it sounds callous in retrospect and I'm not proud that I had that initial reaction but they\nThat up enough or angry enough that night that I thought\nThere's nothing I can do about this the person is in Japan I don't even know really a substantive way to try and reach this person if I wanted\nTo and I clicked my laptop shot and I put it on the floor next to me and I went to bed and\nCynthia didn't really sleep that night and in the morning and she felt terrible for non reaction and she started trying to figure out what to do with all the way in Japan and as far as she was concerned she was the only one to get the email but about that she was wrong [noise]\nThat morning about a dozen people all across the world's got the exact\nSame ... somewhere in Japan and China and various cities across the U.S [noise] most of them didn't know each other all they had in common was that they were writers and then at some point they wrote something for the Washington Post\nMy name is Daryl horn and I'm a novelist brighter Darryl Horne was at home trying to get her four kids ready for school and she decided to just take a quick look at our inbox\nWhen I looked at my messages I saw the title of the message was saving all like I say\nSo I have people throwing lego at me and the sort of thing while I'm reading the message and fighting about who's going to get in the car person this kind of thing and person who's writing to me saying this is my last day on earth\n\nWhile they're at debated what to do around the same time and another city entirely a guy named Ron Charles opened his inbox\nOn the book editor of book world at the Washington Post\nWe get you know you can imagine\nHundreds of pieces of mail there every day\nFrom people desperate to get reviewed or published\nEverybody insist that they know that we get a lot of pictures but in this case their book is really special and if we would just read it if we could just open it and read that first chapter you know we would see but you know if you get thirty of these missions as a day for Seventeen years\nIt's easy to get you know a little skeptical\nHere's there again\nIt almost felt like an emotional mugging but it felt a little bit um I don't want to say manipulative because that that implies a kind of malice that I don't think this person had but it felt unfair I feel guilty even thinking of it that way because I Know that's wrong to feel that way\nThere are Cynthia Enron never met each other all they had in common was the Washington Post and now they all had to figure out what to do about this email\nI was just looking for clues in the email is how I could find this person she mentions that he was in Japan or he gives it provides an email address for his ex wife\nSo I wrote a brief no to this woman just said you know do you remember them you're mentioned at the bottom of the suicide note\nI forwarded the message I said I received it is disturbing message I Hope that you may be in a position to help this person\nIf there's anything you can do there was anything we can do please let us know you know Ron Charles Washington post and then\nI just moved to go on with my day\nCynthia the one who ignore the email at first did some extra research to find out who she could contact she poked around on line and found a relative sense his knees on Facebook and message track\nAnd the messages sent to apologize for getting in touch this way and then explain that she thought Dennis ... should know that ... might be in serious danger [noise]\nI remember that was a snow day in Washington and\nMy daughter was off school so I just close my computer and I took her outside and we played in the snow and I remember\nLaying on the ground and we made snow angels and I just thought God I Hope this guy is okay [noise]\nCynthia didn't hear back from done is not the next day or the day after that and the day after that\nCynthia didn't stop thinking about him and then one day she heard back from his niece\nAnd she said thank you for reaching out to me I Am Dennis Williams nice and he did commit suicide\n[noise]\nI was just got a ... is the best way to describe it it's out it felt like someone to punch me in the stomach\nThat feeling lasted for\nDays and weeks and [noise]\nI guess like any grieving process maybe it sounds strange to say the grieving process because I didn't know him I wasn't a family member of his but\nIt's lingered for a while that I had this connection now to this person but he had very\nDeliberately reached out to establish this\nConnection and that\nThat it hadn't worked out the way I'm Better movie version of it would have worked out where I Would have somehow figured out a way to save him ...\n[noise]\nCynthia decided to do some research into who Dennis\nIt's in the process she found out that she wasn't the only one to get the email so she called some of them up to see how they had reacted too and she was the one that told all of them about Dennis his death\nLike Cynthia there hadn't stopped wondering what happened to Dennis\nAs upsetting as it was when she and I were sort of talking about the timing and it became clear that in fact when I received this message that morning with my children are running over my house he was already dead this horrible\nToo but it does kind of help to know that nothing I could have done that morning would have made any difference I don't know I mean by who cares whether it makes any difference to me um but it does make me feel a little less wretched about it\nBut you know our our lives are predicated on this cat a coal dust so right\nCynthia I'm like the rest of them may have gotten the email when Dennis was still alive but what is truly impossible to know is even if she had emailed him right when she got it that night when she was checking your email in the middle of the night where they have made any difference\nAnd Cynthia talk to his ex wife cake oh she found out the dentist had always plan on doing this he always said what he had said in the email that when his work was done so was he had very strange none of this was at\nAll surprised the cake out\nAn email and her two right before he killed himself\nHe asked her not to be sad I'm\nThen he went up to the roof of his hotel\nAnd he jumped [noise]\n\nWhen I've talked to people about this in the past months and months since that's happened\nBears some folks who say well you know could you have done more and ... where are you being cold about it but he didn't ask for help in fact he said he was resigned to doing this that he had decided I'm not asking of any anything heavier he specifically says that in part of the ladder\nUm he just wanted us ideas to survive\n[noise]\nHe left very few people behind among them a daughter who he didn't raise and who he was a strange from he popped into the lives of few strangers in his last few hours and then he disappeared altogether but not before asking cake out his ex wife to be sure to keep his Facebook and blog up just in case someone got curious\nAbout his work that was the part that upset me the idea that he felt that this was what was important in his life\nAnd nothing else mattered to the point where he was going to kill themselves because there was nothing else in his life that mattered you know I I've been very fortunate to have had a fair amount of success as a writer and so perhaps it's not fair for me to\nSee this because perhaps I Would feel differently if I weren't as successful as I've been but\nWould never occur to me that my writing was the most important thing that I had contributed to the world\nI have another Alan ... a aspects of my career I'm a scholar of yet I shouldn't
