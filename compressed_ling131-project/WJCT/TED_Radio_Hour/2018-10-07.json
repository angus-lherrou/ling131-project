V. at them Jacksonville definitely Jaycee he got word\nFor information on our program are scheduled pan news from the first you can do this [noise]\nIs it had radio our\nEach week groundbreaking had talked a technology entertainment design design is that really would have never known that delivered and Ted conferences around the\nWorld gift of the human imagination we have to believe in impossible thing\nThe true nature of reality back in\nJust beyond those talks those ideas adapted for radio [noise]\nFrom NPR\nI'm Guy ride coming up\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works\nAh every year I have an inkling of where we are\nWhat we need to do is figure out how the brain does it as a biological piece of machinery we now have technology that could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know [noise]\nThis episode what makes us\nThere are many diseases who's genetic causes have been pinpointed precisely a most common genetic diseases cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia Huntington's disease we've known about those you know since the eighties and nineties\nAnd and presumably we can pinpoint things that aren't diseases at all\nSure to the shape of our noses yeah it was a recent paper that was published twenty three and be just released a study a defining the associations between gene variants and\nWhether or not you're a morning person why we're talking about the kinds of things that are out about it the water cooler or on your way to get a coffee and we're beginning to understand\nThe DNA sequences that can explain those behaviors it's it's pretty mind boggling\nWho we are what makes us I guess it's one of the oldest questions out there but new technology means we've never\nCloser to answering it in all kinds of ways that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago so today on the show ideas from science psychology and philosophy about why we are who we are\n\nSo Sam Sandberg worked in the lab that developed one of the most groundbreaking innovations in gene editing you may have heard of it it's called CRISPR and Sam describe why it's such a big deal\nOn the head phage you've known for over half a century that DNA contains the blueprints to make all living things the genome could tell us a lot about ourselves better ancestry or traits and our disease susceptibility is\nBut there are things in the genome that you might not want to find out for example with two misspelled versions of a gene called April before your chance of developing Alzheimer's disease is more than ten times above average\nAnd with a single disease copy of the Huntington gene you virtually guaranteed Huntington's disease a devastating form of a nerve the generation\nAnd then both of these cases there aren't currently any effective prevention or treatment options and so this leaves many wondering is this information even worth knowing\nWell what if we can do more than just learned that information by reading the genome\nBut actually rewrite the genome to cure genetic diseases at their source where the editing the letters of DNA Russ simple and easy is fixing typos in Microsoft Word\nThis is no longer science fiction thanks to a new tool called CRISPR cast nine\nIn the last three years scientists have delivered CRISPR cast nine to human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that cause cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease\nGenome editing and animals themselves is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets and companies already raised almost a billion dollars to apply CRISPR casts nine as a therapy and patience\nThe CRISPR cast my technology was co invented in my PHD lab at the University of California Berkeley and many considered to be one of the biggest breakthroughs of the last couple of decades\nBut five years ago when I started my PHD with Jennifer Doudna CRISPR wasn't the technology at all [noise]\n\nSo you're saying that technology didn't even exist five years ago I mean how\nHas become a huge deal\nSo when I started my PHD and Jennifer's lab that was to any ten you wouldn't find a single mention of CRISPR in you know delayed media unless it was talking about a vegetable CRISPR\nA but in the scientific literature we're really talking a few dozen articles so it was about maybe one month was coming out we now or at a point today where every day we have around five or ten articles being published I think you will will not find a biologist in the world\nThat doesn't do about Chris ... and you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR to how to study whatever biological question they go after and their laboratories because ultimately we're interested in understanding how life works\nAnd if we know that DNA encodes life than what better than a tool to rewrite the DNA and study what the effects are\nOkay the technical details of how Chris for cash nine works are complicated CRISPR for instance is an acronym for clustered regularly ... short\n... repeat and cash nine is the key protein that makes it all work but what you need to know if that CRISPR cast nine makes it easy in a relatively inexpensive to edit genes in precise wave energy can any living thing from bacteria to people\nYou know coming back to the four letters of DNA to get out those eight hundred dictionaries filled\nWith the same for letters and they'll imagine that you have to search for a single page and not just single page but a single letter on that page and mark that site for a change and maybe not any change but an aide to achieve not an easy GE or an aide to see [noise]\nSo for decades this was the kind of pine disguise science fiction idea that we could dream about doing but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter absolutely\nThat's exactly what it does and I'll just had one copy out it's not been demonstrated yet in human patients so if you just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish absolutely with human patients comes the additional challenge of\nGetting to the right cells and that's the same challenge at every drug has to contend with this issue of delivery and now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patience\nNow the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health can be achieved his ultimate goal of sharing a genetic disease at a source at the level of DNA instead of just treating the downstream symptoms\nImagine a future use stem cell technology together as Chris protests nine to remove disease cells from a patient repair them in the lab and the transplant those corrected cells back into the body\nClinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV aids by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patience and I suspect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with CRISPR entering the pipeline to the next few years\nWhat really got folks speaking this past year was the report in may but for the first time ever scientists use CRISPR cast line to edit the DNA in human embryos\nAnd unlike therapy and adult patients this would introduce heritable changes that could be passed on to subsequent generations you can imagine the controversy that this has provoked\nAnd many fear that this technology can be abused that it would usher in an Arab eugenics were designer babies were select few could pick and choose the best genes for their offspring\nOthers would say a free deny unborn children a technology that could ease human suffering or eradicated disease it would be immoral [noise]\nCRISPR cast line is forcing us to rethink what kind of world we want to live in [noise]\nAnd there are ... ethical issues to discuss about how we should use this technology and how it should be regulated [noise]\nThat Sam ... when we come back in just a minute [noise] a little more about how gene editing could change\nWho we are and how we should feel about that [noise] on the show today ideas about\nWhat makes us us I'm Guy rise and you're listening to the head radio hour\nFrom NPR News\nSecretary John Kerry has a new book and in these times get out and vote nobody has a right to sit there and say well I don't have a stake in the snow we all have a stake in our democracy doesn't work by itself the only way to make it work is to put people back in office who want to move the country in the right to\nThe third when John Kerry and his new book every day is

drinking and from the any case the foundation\n\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in our show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking to ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR calf nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans you are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I\nUnique trajectory of experience as we make our way through the world\nAnd make decisions and the decisions affect the way the world treats us including other people and we take away lessons from how we've been treated\nAnd so we set off with a combination of our unique genome and our lab chain of experiences\nOkay just to clarify our environment is helping mould our genes\nOh obviously that is if I was brought up as an Apache or as a a a Japanese samurai or as a Romanian peasant and the fourteenth century there will be differences undoubtedly compared to who I Am now\nSo we just have to to Sam Steinberg about you know like how being a morning person is is possibly in that did have genetic codes so so what else are we probably born with\nSo are we know that the intelligence has a a a big charitable component which doesn't mean that it is\nA completely determined by our genes but it doesn't mean that some of the differences among people can be attributed differences among their genes we know that the differences in personality how conscientious how agreeable how erotic how extroverted\nA are influenced by a by our Gino and even behavioral traits such as ah how likely are you to be a smoker or an alcoholic all of them show some influence of a of our genetic endowment [noise]\n[noise] and even though we can now prove our genomes to actually test some of these things out Keenan says there's another slightly bizarre old fashioned method\nSuch as looking at similarities between identical twins who are separated at birth because identical twins separated at birth share all of their genes but of course not their environments and they show that uh there is a a a pretty hefty statistical\nAh influence of the genes that is if you know what one identical twin is like you can make a lot of predictions about the other one who he or she may never have met me growing up uh an ocean and and the\nCultural way my favorite example is a ... a pair of twins one of whom was brought up\nA as a Catholic and not be family in Germany the other was brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad when they walked into the lab and Minnesota they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with apple ... both of them like two different buttered toast and coffee\nBoth of them kept rubber bands around both of them flush the toilet before using it as well as after\nTo I surprised people by sneezing and crowded elevators to watch them John [laughter]\nSorry my thing too good to be true\nBut ah when you administer a batteries of psychological or you get the same results namely identical twins separated at birth show are quite astonishing similarities [noise]\nThat just unbelievable so then like even things like like habits or or personality clerks are more or less assigned at birth\nWell they're they're influenced at birth I wouldn't say they're assigned because there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain and gels and the first couple of years of life\nAre there are changes that that to unfold over the lifespan whether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the the brain spontaneously develops we don't really know\nYeah there are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged if you if you undergo a trauma or abuse that can leave lasting scars but I think there are certainly a um their statistical forces there is there's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board\nYeah I mean when when you think about like who you are\nI mean ... do you think you're the same person that you were when when you were a child or or a teenager or in your twenties as as you are now\nI I Do see myself as basically the same kind of person I like seeing music I like same foods I like the St pastimes I have I have similar kinds of interests are and ... and research on\nPersonality shows that there was a a a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character or as they go through life\nBut a ... there are certain changes that I see myself that probably occurred in most people would say as they get older we get less erotic we get nicer\nAh we get less anxious as we get older all of us but still if one person is more anxious than another at the age of twenty uh he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of Seventy as well even if both of them are less anxious across the board\nSending it if we are more or less the same right at at twenty or at Seventy isn't even possible to make big changes to who we are\nI think we have the capacity to change our behavior which is really what counts I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in the sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming um constitutionally calm and uh and easy going\nBut certainly there are methods of say cognitive behavior therapy that are probably effective at reducing anxiety and phobias and treating depression yeah uh\nThe thing is that that those don't appeal to a some if serial immaterial soul they uh are ways of acting on our neural circuitry\nWe kept to keep in mind that are neural circuitry is so intricately complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social\nMechanisms of of interacting with language to facial expression the body language that there are ways of of changing our feelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation an example and uh and and art and of evidence based psychotherapy\nSo there is the scope for for a range of behavior within the ... of a given personality type and we can probe the outside of the ... the genes make available to us\n[noise] do you when you think about what what an eight person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious\nHuge parts of it are are certainly mysterious because we interactions are so unfathomable complex yeah there are I tend to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion\nFinances and no one can keep track of all I'm even a ... in a computer simulation\nWe also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or environments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together not not exotic cases of beer twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins at all of us know\nIf you notice a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar to people plucked off the street at random but they're unique individuals that they you won't you don't confuse them when once you know and sometimes they're not friends and sometimes they're not friends are indeed a now how do you account for those differences it's not\nFair I jeans at least not the ones they inherited from their parents that could be some a few mutations that each one or idiosyncratic required\nA it's not there by large their environments because they grew up in the same parents the same school the same house the same older sibs say younger sibs\n[noise] you're really forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for a chance for the role of the dice in a way become because uh\n[noise] two people who have everything in common both the genes and the environmental level nonetheless
