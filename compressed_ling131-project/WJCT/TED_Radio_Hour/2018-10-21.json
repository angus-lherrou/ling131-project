S. D. A. and the FDA Nineteen Seventy seven to first dietary goals for Americans said eat less fat\nWell if you eat less fat the food tastes like cardboard the food industry knew that so what they do they pumped into sugar and now high fructose corn syrup was cheaper so they could do with ... miles let me give you an example of how this works ... my favorite product of all time lucky\nCharms yeah they're magically delicious and they are right why are there marshmallows in the box ... delicious secondary by other marshmallows in the box\nBecause they're fun to eat 'cause marshmallows or sheep and goats are expensive to take up more ruined the box and they can sell them for more wow great business strategy [noise]\nSo everyone says education educate the public to get published tell what's going on except for one thing education hasn't worked for any other substance of abuse\nThe Nancy Reagan just saying no work\nSo where does that leave us everyone says wait a second don't tell me what to eat while you know what you've already been told what to eat\nWhere were you for the last forty years as your food supply was being changed under your nose where you're protesting then everyone says get government out of my kitchen you know I don't want to have in my kitchen either unless there's somebody more dangerous already there\nOkay so the real question is who the hell do you want in your kitchen the government who will take your freedom and your wallet or the food industry who is already taking your freedom your wallet\nAnd your health that's your only choice [noise]\nUm [noise]\nSome given that choice what do we do ultimately we have to figure out how the food industry can still make money selling real food\nAnswer is can they absolutely they can but not with the current business model the food industry grosses one trillion dollars a year in the United states\nOf that four hundred fifty billion of it is gross profit now health care costs in America total to point seven trillion dollars a year of which Seventy five percent\nIs chronic metabolic disease of which Seventy five percent of that could be preventable if we would do something about our diet\nThat's one point four trillion dollars\nTriple what the food industry makes we spend triple cleaning up the food industry's mess than they actually make the bottom line is they're going to drive this bus till the wheels fall off the only answer\nIs real food we just have to figure out how to make it available and profitable for everyone at by the way I'm assuming the sugar industry but really hate you sure you have an intent ... they they love me yeah\nThat's the way this works my job is to provide the science so that the public can make its own informed decision and\nThen but not many people are saying what you're saying I mean\nYou know look there's a lot of noise in the system for obvious reasons you've got all of these this ... of people with their own vested interests I have no vested interests other than taking care of children and seeing children\nGet to adulthood to have a decent chance in life that's my vested interests and to be honest with you it ought to be everybody's tested interest\nSo are you just like totally anti sugar or do you like do you indulge yeah just to just a little bit of course\nNow and again the problem is\nI'm for dessert yeah\nFor dessert right but if you're going to have breakfast cereal\nWith orange juice and take a priest son and a granola bar and that's all before three o'clock\nYou know then you've got a problem\n\nEver let's take is a professor at the University of California in San Francisco you can see his entire talk at Ted that NPR\nWere back in just a minute stay with us on the show today ideas\nAbout how we connect to food I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from NPR\nAn army veteran is facing a new battle with social media he discovered dozens of fake accounts targeting service members and veterans and he's trying to take them down\nThe ultimate goal here is to make the United states in a permanent condition paralysis\nIt's the latest conversation and our ... watch theories that and the latest news on the next all things considered from NPR News\nSunday evening at six on eighty nine nine W.
