nature of reality back in\nJust beyond those talks those ideas\nFrom NPR [noise]\nI'm Guy rise coming up\nI Love this idea of law and the thing that translates number dream about it we all believe in America is what you were just entitle you when you want to go to broker a known to join you don't give up on democracy\n... version of democracy in which law is something that everybody can understand using shake this episode hacking the law first this news\nOne for the rich and one for everyone else [noise] that's\nFor a moment about what it means to be in jail even for a few days\nIt can mean losing your job losing your home jeopardizing their immigration status\nIt may have been losing custody of your children what's more if you're in jail on bail your four times more likely to get a jail sentence and if you've had been freed\nJail sentence will be three times longer\nAnd if you are black or Latino and cash fell has been fat you are two times more likely to remain stuck in that jail cell that if you were white now imagine is just one moment that if you stuck in that jail cell and you don't have the five hundred dollars to get out\nAs someone\nComes along and offers you a way I\nJust think guilty they say\nYou're going to go home back to your job\nJust plead guilty even ...\nYou just like anybody would do in that situation you plead guilty whether you did it or not\nYou have a criminal record that went to follow you for the rest of your life\nSo we've interviewed really some really innovative thinkers about how to reform the criminal justice system and you came upon a a really simple way to kind of hacking to kind of look at this and say wait a minute there could be simpler way to start to tackle this can you tell me how you came to that idea\nShort so uh my husband and I were actually sitting having dinner one night and many many years ago I he's also up with a public defender and we were venting about watching one more client plead guilty so she could go home and my husband said you know we should just start paying bail for our clients we should start to bail fund and just start paying their mail\nAnd in that moment the idea was boring we weren't sure whether we could do it we weren't sure what the results would be but we knew that we had something there that if you could attack this problem at the front end we might be able to actually begin to unpack some of the injustice\nSue you we just got to work you started to raise money\nWe did so we we pitched the idea for very long time and um had a very hard time getting anybody to 'em and give us any donations for the ...\nAnd then I met Jason ... and his father Joe ... and they had a Family Foundation and they were courageous enough to be our very first donors and they gave us a donation of a hundred thousand dollars to start the Bronx freedom fund\nAnd we began to pay people's bail with that funds and what we learned is the revolving nature of the ... is that a dollar that you use any here can be used two or three times because of the end of a criminal case the bail comes back into the fund\nA I Would be bold enough to say that some of those dollars that the farm family gave us way back when it's probably still operating in the Bronx today\nSo when when when somebody post bail and they go to trial and their case is dismissed that bill money's returned\nTo bail money gets returned regardless of the case outcome\nI'm at the point of bail is to ensure that people come back to court so if somebody comes back to court for each and every court appearance at the end of the case where there was a guilty plea whether it was a conviction or whether it was a complete a quid alert dismissal the bail money comes back so it can revolve over and over again if you create a fund\nSo how does it work I mean you you have teams of people who would go to jail and say don't plead guilty we can help push bail for you is that how it works\nSo the most important work gets done by our local people on the ground we called bailed is raptors many of them have been formerly incarcerated are impacted by the criminal legal system themselves they work on the ground to interview\nPeople in jail and what we've learned from\nThe Bronx freedom fund is at all you need to ensure that people come back to court is effective ways to notify them about the next court dates and to provide some support systems while they're out of jail and taking them to services that might exist and community so when problems come up to prevent them from coming back to court we can help them solve that problem\nTen years we had been paying they'll a low income residents of New York city and what we have learned\nHow to load at our ideas of why people come back to court and how the criminal legal system itself it's operate it\nMoney isn't what makes people come back to court we know this because when the ... bail Ninety six percent of clients returned for every quarter parents it's powerful evidence that we don't need\nOr ankle bracelets or unnecessary systems of surveillance and supervision we simply need court reminders about when they come back to court\nNext we learn and if they're held in jail on a misdemeanor Ninety percent of people will plead guilty but when the sun pays bell over half the cases are dismissed\nAnd in the entire history of the house freedom finds\nFewer than ... percent of our clients have ever received a gel that\nAn eighth [noise]\nIt sounds like ... over the course of your career and you sort of comes with English and then the system of these massive reform but that may be a decades long struggle and in the meantime one way to attack it is by attacking bail is by dealing with the bail issue yeah the way I like to think about it as this while\nWe're thinking through ways offer systemic reform to happen while litigators litigating cases wild policy reformers are doing their work people sitting in jail cells today they need a lifeline\nWe can't ask them to sit in those cold concrete jail cells while we talk about systemic reform it takes too long so when we think about resolving bell funds when we think about the bell project or the Bronx freedom fund or the community bill funds that does is turn this country\nThat is an immediate lifeline to those folks sitting in jail cells as we hope to continue to Nate and moved systemic reform forward\nWhen we think about like you know examples of criminal justice or injustice in America you know like vigilante justice for the way people behave in the in the wild west and we thank\nGod you know one I'm civilized time like we think we were just so much more involved in in civilized and the way that we deal with us now but but we're not\nSo we're kidding ourselves um and I know that that is very hard for all of us to grapple with because all of us are implicated in what has become our criminal legal system\nUm you know we seem to have in this country an insatiable appetite for incarceration ah we seemed to have in this country of very harsh mentality around punishment to we have views are criminal legal\nSystem to solve social problems that we used to look at as all of our responsibilities instead we have pushed it away from our consciousness\nAs if it didn't implicate all of us but of course\nThat's Robin Steinberg in November of two thousand Seventeen

for animal rights lawyer Stephen Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise\nLike to have you look at this pen so it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing\nVery similar to the hearing that James Somerset had and justice Jaffe actually was quite similar to a more Mansfield\nShe in a long decision made it clear that she was quite sympathetic to our arguments but ultimately solve that she was bound by the decision of a higher court in another part of of the state of New York but I Believe that she had not\nFelt that way she would likely have rules in our favor\nYou are trying to change the law in a big way this is a big uphill battle like you may not see the end of this battle\nWell just like a human rights lawyer is not going to see the end of the human rights battle the battle for human rights will continue as long as there are humans who want to explain to each other but what I'm already living to see is the beginning of the battle there really\nIsn't a battle when one sides a thing and the other side's a person there there isn't a battle the battle begins when both sides are persons and their rights begin to conflict that's the battle that are already beginning to see\nAnd that's the one that I was hoping to live to see and to bring about and it's happening [noise]\nThat Steven ... he's the founder of the non human rights project you can watch his entire talk at ... dot com\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law and how we can change\nGovernment to be more fair to the people it represents [noise] do you think that there are better alternatives to democracy or do you think that in general democracy is the best way to govern ourselves [noise] I'm a big fan of democracy [laughter]\nThis is bad headache and even though he's totally pro democracy he actually got a big problem with elections\nMy ideal of democracy is at a every person\nShould have an equal say in the direction of the countries in the laws of that country\nOf course this is a theoretical you accomplished by giving one person one vote but as most people know in practice it's not practical they call it the most votes a wasted many people don't vote lots of people such as migrants refugees count votes um so my ideal democracy\nIs one way or the conceded will of the people is taken into account and I think elections don't achieve those ideals\nSo in your view our elections just fundamentally anti democratic [noise]\nIs fundamentally flawed in the way the practice now ...\nThey have a elites and they have a a money it interests famous thinkers for centuries equated elections with aristocracy and all the ... or so I'm I'm happily putting myself within these group of people and saying you know I think elections\nActually fundamentally flawed\nAnd whether we can overcome the crisis I think there's basically two responses that we can take them one has to go down the populist caused the fascist roots and the other is to trust fund mechanisms and modes to do democracy veteran differently\nThan the exact mechanism for fixing democracy that Brett has in mind well it's a pretty radical here's bread headache on the stage\nSo I'm going to ask you two questions I Want you to put your hands up if you agree the first question is who thinks living in a democracy is a good thing [noise]\nThe second question is who thinks out democracies a functioning while selling off the one politician in the audience somewhere not\nBut my point is there is a massive paradox of contradiction here I think there's two ways to resolve this paradox\nOne is to give up on democracy the other option I think\nIs to fix this broken system which brings me to my ... my mom and a ... month it's technical name so titian but it's common name is random selection and the idea is actually very simple randomly select people and put them in parliament\nWeight you know you want to just put random people into a into a legislative body and say here you go figure figure it out is that is that more or less what you're saying [laughter]\nUm this seemingly absurd idea is actually based\nOn hundreds of experiments worldwide with this actually\nHappens happens while the Ireland is the most recent country to have randomly selected non the nine people to talk about the constitutional ban on abortion to talk about how they can tackle climate change to talk about other things I fix him parliament's\nThese Ninety nine randomly selected\nSample of people went through weekends of deliberation informed by experts with public input into that process and they came up with the proposal supported by around two thirds of them to abolish this constitutional ban on abortion which was then put to a referendum on about two thirds the Irish people agreed with them\nIf these people are so good at is why do we still need politicians\nHave to be honest that idea scares me I don't want the first hundred people on the phone book running the country I Want people who are steeped in policy who understand the nuances of ... get made and who understand the consequences like that's what I Want so how does a random democracy you know solve this problem\nDon't produce X but this is a complete jealousy otherwise we would elect our brain surgeons um yeah elections produce people who are good at winning elections\nAnd to be good at winning election you need a massive war chest of money you need to be charismatic you need to be out to inspire people with ridiculous tweets I don't I'm not sure but it doesn't mean that you're good at making policy at making so I Would actually argue that's a random representative sample\nWith good process informed by experts who of course a darn have power they just have the power to give it for ...\nUm [noise] would result in better policy of course you would potentially need these people to go through an induction process what they learn about how the system guys will how low making is made except for\nThe other option that we hand over the running of our country to a group of experts is exactly what authoritarian regimes argue China\nIn theory is run by groups of ... so yeah I think it's it's ah you open yourself up to the accusations with our terrorism if you say I think we should actually handed over to a techno procedural something\nWell that's the thing like let me see if I understand it correctly\nIn a system that you think would have would be a better system more representative essentially you would eliminate election yes right you get rid of people voting for elected officials you get rid of that and you would have some kind of system a lottery ... a lottery whatever it is where people are randomly selected from the population\nAnd they get a letter in the mail and say hey you know you're going to be represented for the next two years and that's\nThat's how you would you let it go do it uh there's a lot of personal questions around that but the key thing is that it works when people do this people make trusted balanced decisions and I I I think it would lead to a massive increase in trust in the in the governmental system and the decisions that are my\nAnd we come back in just a moment red headache describes how he envisions randomly selecting leaders on the show today hiking\nThe law I'm Guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour
