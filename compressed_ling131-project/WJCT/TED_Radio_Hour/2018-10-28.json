little easier to deal with\n[noise] I don't like doing radio ever unless I'm totally in control really because I have a face for TV not right now\nThat is true this is Mason diet she's a standup comedian\nDo you think ultimately that comedy can change people's minds I think Gary has we've seen\nFor generations comedy taking the risks that no one else would weather was will and grace mainstreaming the ... community on prime time television or you know black fish right now I think comedy\nIs the easiest most reliable way to tell people things they don't want to hear\nYou know earlier you were you were saying that you didn't set out to be an activist or or an advocate but I mean you sometimes ended up changing people's\nMinds right right so like I've never been like okay if I'm going to talk about Palestine Israel and how people deserve equality regardless of faith I have to use comedy because otherwise people are going to get defensive it's more like oh I'm going to tell a joke about when I was strip searched and I'm not really thinking about like\nThis is the best way to deliver this message I'm thinking about this is a really funny story I'm totally gang up on to laugh and then it's usually not till after the show where I'm like oh my God\nSomeone just came up to me and said they didn't know that Palestinians where people they thought that was the name of a terror group and it's like it's always afterwards that I realized I shaking someone's ground\nIt's never my intention to go out and do that my only intention is make them laugh get on General Hospital women\nThat's may soon as I can hear her full talk to dot com\nOkay so may soon was just saying that she's not a comedian and activists being you basically use comedy is like your form of activism yes\nComedy is like the best tool for that it just opens people up and what makes comedy so effective is that if you're making them laugh along the way they're going to listen to the deeper cuts stuff\nThis is Nick ... also a standup comic they use the daughter of Iranian immigrant and as a kid her parents were regalia her with stories about life during the Iran Iraq War specifically the unusual way they got through bombing range\nAnd they talked about how they would go into the\nBasement and how they would turn on the candles and how they would block out all the windows and they would be like oh we would play\nCards raising retail stores and then we hear a bomb and then we worry that it was our neighbor you know and\nThen again so I think the human\nCapacity you know the way humans get through these really terrible times is by flipping the script on themselves a kind of lets you take the story back into your own hands\nBegins own turn flipping the script happened when she was in college right after September eleventh and the start of a wave of Islamophobia\nAnd it started becoming clearer and clearer that Islamophobia is one of those things is not going away I kept thinking like oh will be will hate Muslims for like a few months and then we'll stop like I just thought that was going to be a reasonable projector\nUm and then that guy never never stopped you know and um and I felt like I could you know I had a voice in my voice as an Iranian American Muslim was\nNot something that the average American has already heard\nAnd and again decided that the best way to disarm the haters was to make them laugh and that's\nBeen the goal is just um you know if you have never had a Muslim friend um maybe my stupid face can be or Muslim friend\nAnd the game does this through what she calls social justice comedy and how it works well here's the gains explanation from the stage\nOf the American population can be broken up into three main categories there's mostly wonderful people haters and Florida\nTraveling category here are the haters\nComedian it's my goal to convert\nThese hairs because they have a lot of things which leads the negative outcomes like a racism violence and Ted Nugent on a plane is we have to reckon with the haters but there's various within this group and it's not they should go after all of that right so one\nDone is I've created a highly scientific taxonomy of haters I basically took all of haters I put them in a petri dish like a scientist\nThat we have the trolls they're the people who have quit their jobs so that they can post on Youtube videos all day long on there's\nHaters now these people will be at a stoplight they'll wait for them to turn green and white male that tree\nMost interested in is the swing hater they just because they don't have enough information in the group I liked the target was social justice comedy because\nIt makes you laugh right I don't think you enter into a state of openness and a moment of open it's a good social justice comedian can still get a whole bunch of information and if they're really skilled erectile exam\nFor social justice comedy first off it's not partisan okay this is a political comedy this is about justice and no one is against justice\nIf I don't want to make it if you're sitting inside of a burrito\nWhat's it like you're going to be hearing a real like an interesting treaties on income inequality that taste that are really sophisticated poo joke right\nOkay so she wanted to do something about Islamophobia and you want to look for swing haters\nSo me and another comedian ... decided to round up like a bunch of Muslim American comedians um as per usual\nAnd take him around the country to places like Alabama and Tennessee in\nThe you know what I mean just like places where you are accustomed to seeing like a bunch of friendly Muslims and so we would duty street action we would set up like an ... in the middle of town square\nQuestions about Islam\nThe joy just about I was trying to join\nReplied them with pastries so that they can feel like hey someone who's going to give me pastries doesn't have it out for me\nWhat would people get

know because I don't know where that job and I don't know coverage so you know so like people could ask those questions I don't\nI'm another question that was frequent was\nWhy don't Muslim denounce\nTerrorism and why I haven't seen\nWe got that everywhere and I continue to get that and my travels all over the country why don't Muslims denounced terrorism I'm sure there's a huge PR misstep\nThat happened and where Americans think that Muslims felt the ... and I don't know how this happened because literally every Muslim I Know Doug\nI'm like did we not tweeted out and then\nWhen
