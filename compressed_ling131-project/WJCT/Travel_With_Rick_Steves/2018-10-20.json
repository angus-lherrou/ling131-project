easy just to see a play\nNo unfortunately we don't have any fear they're being presented inside the fear that if they are nice those but if you want you can visit there is an entrance fee so you can

theater as a way to criticize your political leaders if necessary without being thrown in prison for it\nTo make a commentary on the day I understand there's only like forty inch and played surviving

Julius Caesar and then the merchant of Venice in to Swahili and these are now cornerstones of East African let's turn the under the tree a syllabus out that [noise]\nAnd you know I I think well it's extraordinary here is that in your area for various reasons has insights into Shakespeare's plays I think you know when you translate something you have to think about the weight and the meaning of every ... I'm an ... because of this\nBut also in part because he comes from a very a very different parts of the world he has insights about Shakespeare's plays which actually most scholars nowadays would would accept and agree with but you know this is\nEast Africa not just taking Shakespeare from from Britain but giving it back to Britain in a different dies in a different framework which which reveals that in a new light\nHe teaches English literature at Cambridge University and he's the author of Shakespeare in Swahili now\nEdward describes how the works of Shakespeare played an important role in forming a new nation of South Sudan in an earlier and fear of travel with Rick Steves you can listen in our show our\nProgram number five twelve that's from January twenty eight to ... you know East Africa is gone through\nA lot of uh two molten pug award especially during the Cold War\nI Would imagine this a respect for British cultured someone has some relation to the money invested in that part of the world to would away from the Soviet union's a court\nIs is that true and then after the end of the Cold War what was the impact of ... just frankly less interest in that part of the world 'cause it wasn't a a in the struggle with the Soviet Union\nYeah so this is a major part of the story in the late twentieth century I think on the one hand African intellectuals was seeking to Africa now is the education system so to put African culture and African ... at the center of what students learn to bump\nBut part of this was displacing ... uh like I said in the education system but the government what very the government for instance Kenya will very uncomfortable with that because it signaled they felt the wider world a desire not to engage with the west and by extension with with capitalism\nSo Daniel are more in the presence of Kenya at the time and now the Nineteen eighties takes extraordinary sat through executive action reinstating Romeo and Juliet reinstating Shakespeare on the East African school syllabus offer it to being taken off\nAs a show to say you know we'll open to world culture but he had a meeting where the western culture and I think you know he's saying where open to the western money we wouldn't be a you know the soft power to stop because we don't want the the money to stop\nI Would think in Swahili land there is sort of a scar tissue of colonialism and they're sort of disinclined to embrace things that reek of colonialism but on the other hand there's this global culture that any nation can aspire to could you kind of bring it to a full circle here by just\nYour book is subtitled in search of a global poet can you frame Shakespeare in East Africa something other than a British colonial heritage I mean can it be something grander than that and just a success for local culture as a you know symbolic of them breaking away from their colonial heritage\nI think during the course of this story there's a lot of back and forth um Shakespeare is named position and then he is something that is rejected by people as you say traumatized by the the colonial legacy\nBut at the end of it there is a re engagement with Shakespeare for instance in the writing of the the greatest Kenyan novelists and ... the only go on whose work is shot through with Shakespeare\nAnd I think it shows that politics\nAnd economics sometimes mean to a book ends up in a particular place but what ... to do with it when it gets that\nIs it more complex thing and I think Shakespeare is as being really made a new in East Africa as he has been in in many other places and it he openness to uh to being taken and reshaped a native new I think he is positive that you know this isn't\nWell Edward Wilson Lee thanks for shining a light on
