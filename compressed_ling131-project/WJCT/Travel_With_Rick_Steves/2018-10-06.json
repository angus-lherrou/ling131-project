[noise]\nThat shower rush rush hour shoot a law so you that's a\nGood advice you start with that kind of juvenile little uh the joy of mispronouncing words to be understood and then you have that as a basis\nI remember when I was in Japan just a handful of words went a long way it certainly does and I felt that people were very quick to accept the fact that I didn't speak the language anywhere near fluently but I knew the words\nRight in fact Japanese themselves to lead their language is difficult and so they are they praise you if you even say like Ohio goes I must have ... they say well you're Japanese is so good or doesn't\nMove because she is that difficult yes was it costs you I Would always say you know if I was befuddled I Would just go with the country so they thought that was very impressive\nOne of the best phrases I think to learn is on the guy she month that means I'm please help me or please give me something or please be kind to me\nIt means so many different things and it's it's a very nice request on the guy she months\nHe picks up because it's it's fun like instead of up or you can say do more to go though and which I mean ... thank you very much or you could just

have an accent\n[noise] Ruthie can eighties or guest right now and travel with Rick Steves [noise] she was born in Tokyo raised in Japan by American parents were Mennonite missionaries she's taught English and Japanese language and culture at universities in Japan and the U.S with the author of the moon guidebook living abroad in Japan\nAnd she also leads by tours of Hokkaido [noise] we have a link to her website with this week showing Rick Steves dot com slash radio [noise]\nSo we're the if you're thinking about living in Japan moving\nThere and and maybe a teaching English you've got a lot of choices of course you could live in Tokyo that's like the New York city of Japan or you could live on one of the island's what do we have a hunch shoe that's the big island cue issue in the south\nShe ... a kind of up in the north how would we weigh the pros and cons of this if you're thinking about Tokyo\nWould that be a good place to live ... why would you live there or why would you not live there\nWell it really depends on your interests and I have a page in the book where I give advice on where to live if you want to learn Japanese or where to live if you think you only want to get by an English or where to live if you like big cities and lots of activities\nOr if you like nature and so I go through the pros and cons of different areas and I'm sure somebody who loves living in LA or New York city would enjoy Tokyo very much\nBut if you live in a small town in Oregon like me and like to go hiking and biking you might enjoy living in the mountains or in one of the smaller communities in ... or ...\nYeah that is interesting I was just in New York city and for me that's the big ... big metropolis and that sort of overwhelming and there's so much energy and when I think about my time in Tokyo says the same thing I mean just being in Tokyo was a\nIt was exhilarating and exhausting at the same time so much Eagle's actually kind of sensory overload and a lot of people thrive on that and for other people it's exhausting\nHunch who is the main island where you'll find most of the population in Tokyo what other major opportunities on hunch you might you find where else might you consider living\nWell you could live in the ... region which is where killed throwing Osaka is if you like Japanese history or interested in religion Buddhism or ... might be ideal\nKyoto is quite an amazing place isn't it and it feels like a sacred city or a religious spiritual capital is there a reason that feels that way\nWell there are over a thousand temples and shrines with a long history\nAnd it's surrounded by hills and mountains on three sides\nBut it also has a modern side if you arrive at Kyoto Station and look around and you'll see a tower called killed the tower and you'll think where the temples in shrines but it's a fascinating city and you can spend many days or even years living there and exploring it's also a walkable city\nI had a beautiful experience in a real concern there when you're traveling just got to stay in a real kind of traditional sort of a guest house and from there you can get on the ferry and go across to ... and ... seemed a little bit more traditional and sort of off the beaten path to me\nYes I Love ... and as you say it's more off the beaten path and I find in a way I think that's the real Japan no small villages it's lots of mountains\nIt's also famous for a sacred pilgrimage route of eighty eight Buddhist temples ... that was established over a thousand years ago\nAnd currently it's very popular with even young people from Europe or America to go and walk that pilgrimage route of eighty eight temples and along the way you meet local people who will\nGive you things offerings because they know that you're on a pilgrimage ... and that's truly off the beaten path summertime you're walking up steep mountain roads and bamboo force\nThat was one thing that I was sort of challenged by when I was in Japan to try to find a place it truly was off the beaten path because\nIt's a highly developed country with a with a dense population but in your experience are there ways to find places where the old fashioned lifestyle and still surviving\nYes ah one place I recommend the islands of the inland sea between the biggest island of ... and ... who is a protected see that's almost like Mediterranean and it has hundreds of islands\nAnd it's possible to bicycle across about six or eight islands that are connected with religious all the way from ... to ... fantastic bridges with separate bike lanes if you want a bicycle a hum I recommend stopping overnight on several those villages\nAnd you will find a rural lifestyle slow pace of life farmers fishermen they grow citrus lemons olives and their ferries that you can take all over and so that would be\nNecessary inland sea between ... and ... my favorite memories we're going under the ferry and\nTell me if it's still this way but everybody would take off their shoes and you'd be on this carpet and people be sitting around eating their sweet little oranges [laughter] we need gun yes in some cosy on a ferry we're stocking rate cosy on a ferry boat\nRight they usually have a seats for those who want to be seated but if you go on the carpet area or sometimes even Khatami the rush woven mats yeah yes you do take off your shoes which means you're at home because you always take your shoes off when you're at home so you can relax you can lie down take a nap or chat with friends\nI've never been so charmed by public fairy has in the inland sea of Japan stocking feet [noise]\nHow religious pluralism worked in Japan and the changing roles of women in the workplace\nWe'll take your calls for the seven seven

Kobe\nAnd then we travelled to Osaka by the train and we ...\nI went with her and her three American young model for a vicar of them and we get some really interesting dining\nAt places that we had no idea what we were the only thing we could recognize on their menu of fifty ... ... and it was not anything like we had ever experience ... before\nWe asked for dessert the only thing that she had was mandolin mandolin that's all they had like ... which is a Mandarin fell for decided we'd take a while we left our heads off because they brought it on a plate and that was one lander and arch like

and then make a move that we are going to go left or right so we get that far and then we'd ask somebody else and we did that all the way along never had any problem everybody was more than willing to help us even though they couldn't understand that they couldn't understand that\nSounds like a good time thanks for your call when you talk about it\nThis is travel with Rick Steves have been talking with Ruth you can ag her book is living abroad Japan\nRuth you can tell I've got an interest in a\nJapanese eating I think I've eating when eating in Japan better than any place have been on this planet and it's just fun I'm not saying it's the finest cuisine I'm just saying\nMeal was an adventure I just enjoyed it uh I even going on the the bullet train the ... and I remember the what's the

surrounded by all the wonders of Japan and he just going life is good\nWhat is what is your favorite eating experience in Japan\nWell I Do enjoy buying the bend tools at train stations to eat on the train or if you don't have time the lady with the cart comes through the whole yeah the train cars to sell things so you can get Huck Huck coffee or ice cream they think convenience\nSeriously I think in a yeah a lot of convenience and they're eating\nI I think you'll never go hungry as Japan because there's food available um many places I Would say one of my favorites is going to ... which is like a pub or you order\nSmall dishes like pop us almost and grilled fish or nice um vegetables things like that then you have a drink and usually go with a group of friends so yeah it's very social\nI always say be a cultural chameleon you know you just got to physically more to the country you're in one great thing about a Japan I got to say I I never feel like is hockey here in in the United states but when I'm In a in a hotel in Japan there's usually a stocky machine down the hall and it's it's heated Psaki isn't it\nRight socket and beer sometimes even was highly highly machine\nThe machine and it's just it's a nice way to ...\nThis has been so much fun talking with you about Japan and if you just your book is about living abroad in Japan with an idea about how\nYou might change if you choose to live in Japan\nIf you're a foreigner in Japan and you might notice that Japanese people are more modest and reserved in public they don't usually talk loudly they also notice the needs of other people so if you're on the train or walking down the street and you need help as you mentioned already Rick\nSomebody will stop and help you\nI think even my body language changes when I go to Japan that is I'm not flailing my arms and hands around so much in speaking in a loud voice\nI'm you kind of pay attention to people around you and not exactly copy them though but you respect you picking yes respect and and children are trained that way at home and in in kindergarten\nYou know there's something about Japan that is contagious a in a beautiful way and it almost sounds cartoonish but I found when I was in Japan I Would start you know people kind of ... just now a little bit is in the almost yes he almost turned around and you back out of the room with little ... and\nIt's not a caricature it's just a respectful mannerism and you find yourself\nEnjoying taking off your shoes when you come in and and seeing all the nice words and and doing a lot in class in your hand politically together and it's just a contagious beauty of Japanese culture\nThing I really miss when I come back to the states is when you go into a store or restaurant bank or post office there is no greeting but in Japan anytime you walk into a bank or post office or store they welcome you in unison shiny must say welcome and when you leave they all say how do you go\nAnd I must stop and when you get used to that and then you come home to the U.S and you go in the post office or bank or store nobody says that in ... I kind of miss that\nAnd it's more than just one person it's sort of an almost an organizer for us the lay down this together you almost feel like you're in a musical\nRight so they notice every customer that comes through the door whether you're washing dishes or serving food or cooking you have one of my one year almost on the front door and so when a customer comes in you automatically everyone just says eat our shame on us and make make you feel welcome\nWell Rudy ...
