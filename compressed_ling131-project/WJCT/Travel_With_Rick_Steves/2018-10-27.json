America dot com [noise] he's coauthored the guidebook ghost towns of the west with Philip Barney [noise]\nWith these towns mostly or\nAre they almost all from mining or are we are a lot of them did they have other kinds of economies cause I can think mining would be more boom and bust twisted also some of them were on pain lines or some of them were Cal hurting centers or what was the economy back then\nYeah you're right a lot of it was\nFinding a but there was also ranching centers there was also railroad camps there was a construction camps in Johnson canyon near ask for that required some major toll development things that nature in a thriving little community survived there for over five years a meeting the needs of the Arab community\nKind of a sad thing is they've just been literally picked clean of anything of any a historic value I think they're just basically number left\nA lot of them have in the modern era especially with a everybody has a four wheeler a jeep a lot of these really remote places now are so accessible\nAnd as a result souvenir hunters have I've picked and clean and also the environments pretty harsh on these places and a lot of them right away it's an exception but a lot of these towns were literally just thrown together and there was no fought to longevity was the quick buck\nAnd what if people have a romantic sort of interest and why it or to accommodate like me what's tombstone\nTombstone is uh to Disneyland says it's really changed my wife's father was actually born in tombstone\nAnd his grandfather was the sheriff there in ... county [noise] he talked about it with our family reunion he was surprised that they had taken the sidewalks out and put in boardwalks\nIt sounds like if you want Hollywood fantasy you go to my son is there a town in your mind that would give you the tombstone experience that's not tombstone but actually more accurate\nThere's quite a few uh Daggett, California is a pretty neat little town um it's a fall on hard times there's almost nobody left but the little general store there has survived it's been in business since Nineteen eighty nine\nOr ... Arizona is another one that's really worth a good visit especially if you follow the old senator highway from Prescott, Arizona ... you can get a time capsule feel\nYou wrote a book vulture city in Arizona also\nYeah vulture cities a lot of fun just outside a wiccan Berg up they've preserved it quite well it's a privately owned and they are preserved a lot of the buildings and sort of a rusted state of decay\nIs travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Jim and clean and his book is ghost towns up to West Point Jim thumbing through this for a lot of research and travel that when this all over the west [noise]\nWhat was it like researching these ghost towns and how did you know where to go and uh what were some of the most enjoyable or exciting discovery she made\nThis book really was a the research has been going on for about fifty years with this book I started as a kid or here in Arizona visiting some of these places where the old timers and kind of getting firsthand information at these places\nAnd the rest of it's been researched and getting to know people like Bob ... bell was true west magazine and archivist state archives and small town museum\nSlid one thing to find something in an archive but it's another thing to actually walk up the dusty street and I'm just looking at the the photograph on the cover of your book and just\nBe there and there's just tumble weeds and the wind and no people anywhere recount for us a moment in your research where he just thought wow this is just really exceptional\nCinder highway going up to a crowned king there's a place back then senator highway and when your data or Arizona it would be a territorial highway from the Eighteen seventies and it's a dirt road it's about forty miles takes about a four to five hours to travel\nAnd you're following this old highway and you come around the corner and here's a true story stage station\nWas the power station and I found out that had a real colorful transitional history it was a hotel and end stage station in the Eighteen seventies but they were running stage coaches down this road is late is Nineteen Fifteen and as a result they also had an automobile repair facility at this location at one time\nAnd I found that transition really I'm quite fascinating\nYou know in Europe there's a number of places that have recognized him a dying culture and they've preserved it with a\nLittle um video biographies of people telling their own story and you get to see them and hear their voices is there any museum that you think is particularly good that gives us a sense of the the real humanity of the the Old West\nYeah the gold king mine up in Jerome, Arizona Mr Roberts and just passed away recently but his family is carrying it on he preserved a lot of this year the operating saw mills or from the late Nineteen century a lot of originally equipment that he would fire up and show you how it\nWorked and his family still does that ten for visitors yes so it sounds like if you want to go to one state to see goes down to it sounds like Arizona State\nWell my favorite is a New Mexico the reason for New Mexico is because the ghost towns there are really old you will find ghost towns like um San jose in Mexico um I think there's ten people left\nIt dates to about Seventeen Ninety the little church there was built in Eighteen twenty six and its cast a shadow over the Santa Fe trail the national trails wrote Andrew sixty six\n... and also you write about lake valley in New Mexico\nLake valley is an amazing place or the bridal chamber\nTo this date that is the richest silver deposit ever discovered wow the silver was so pure they were they were literally melting it off the walls with their lanterns they're mining when they must\nHave been going crazy now that was back in the Eighteen eighties right\nAh yeah the late Eighteen eighties the whole black range there was a lake valley Hillsboro in Kingston all the barrel boom towns but that bridal chamber in lake valley was the richest silver deposit ever discovered\nAnd the word of that must have traveled like wildfire back in those days\nIt did it brought in all the speculators and are honest people as well but it's it's sparked things well one fellow down near Shakespearean Mexico he got the idea that they were doing so well north he sold to the area with diamonds and sold the claims made himself a small fortune\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Tim Brinkley the author of ghost towns of the western learning a little bit of wisdom of the Old West let's just close with a\nWith a thought if he were hosting a European tourists traveling around the United states had\nFor understanding the wild west where would you take him for just a real living and fund taste of our nation's wild west history [noise]\nProbably does beers on um [noise]\nIt's kinda stretches the point of ghost town but it's become more of an artist colony but just so much that remains there and the people are passionate they preserved things it's\nA really dynamic and fund who plays in a very scenic location\n... Arizona All right hey Jim Hensley thanks so much and congratulations on your book goes down to the west thank you [noise]\nKim shares an Old West coast let's in in the ... extra to this week's show at ... dot com slash radio\nCarl Huffman went all the way to New Guinea to investigate an unsolved Rockefeller family mystery from Nineteen sixty one he tells us what he found in just a bit\nFirst singer Kathy Ryan remembers Ireland heroes and legends and its spirited ballad songs it's travel with Rick Steves\nThis week wait wait don't tell me celebrates Twenty years of pointing out how incredibly stupid the news is on Peter Segal and all I can say is we'll stop when they do join us for it all started celebration was all our panelists as right all of them especially we'll get\nTo the quiz that's just one year away from being able to buy the dreams we desperately need after Twenty years of doing this\nWait wait for men feel Saturday morning at ten on eighty nine nine W.

America look at some of the heroes of Ireland summary on some legendary we're joined now by singer caffeine\nCat he's proud Irish American she lives in the northeast\n[noise] public ... he's with us right now in travel with Rick Steves to introduce us to some of the people that Ireland remember and it's so\n... so good to have you here it is great to be here\nWhenever I think of you I I just think of\nJust a joy of life in the context of Ireland ... music ties in with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yes a Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl gets so just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nA white mall when we\nWere flickering\nNo\nI dropped the berry in St Jean and called and\nIt was in the\nTrial sitting here at this table across from you and watching you thing that I've been in the ... with you when there's quiet and then somebody sings in a solo or could pull away like this would that'd be normally sung a compelling yes so you can have all sorts of chaos and dancing and music and federal\nAnd then silence yes all attention goes to usually a female singer often what's it like to be in a pub all sorts of beer all sorts of flirting going on all sorts of craziness and then\nAll the tension on you and you're sharing something from Ireland\nMore than the past from the saw\nIt just happened to me recently the other week I was in temporary and uh the musicians were playing and people were banging their feet and lots of chatter and I started to sing and silence just descended on the room\nAt such a privilege for that to happen and you feel that you're not being honored so much as they're honoring you singing the song you're conduit\nYes hope they're honoring you singing the song and they need to listen to the words of the song and my father always said what makes you a great singer is not singing in the middle of the catch\nIt's not having an amazing range it's being able to take someone out of the room\nAnd you do that and for a traveler to have that experience there is nothing like it a try not to use the word magical thing 'cause that's easier thrown but when I'm In a pub in Ireland and the spirit is right and especially when suddenly it's quiet and somebody sings a song that lets you touch the sort of Ireland there's nothing like it\n... its transcendent it transcends the here and now the mundane the it goes to another level and that's something that gates believed and he thought that's what made the Irish special different\nCopyright and bringing a genuine Irish shoulders right now [noise] travel with Rick Steves says we explore how Ireland history of legendary characters\nHave been more than you saw [noise]\nCathy post lyrics to the phones ballot she's recorded\nGot to we've talked about heroes with the rising renting sixteen we've talked about how poetry has carried by music\nAlso there's a lot of villains and Irish history how does traditional Irish music [noise] remember the villains\nWell we don't like to think that we're ... we like to think we're all heroes [laughter]\nSo most of the Irish songs about villains are song from the point of view of the person who's trying to overcome whatever obstacle the villainous putting in its path and then you have just some really\nDark songs like when you when you lie yeah which is a song you learned as a child in Ireland and it's absolutely horrific but it's done in such a variety me sing song you way that it's actually enjoyable to sing you want to hear a bit of that really really well yes yes yes I was\nThere was an old woman who lived in the woods we uh we there was another woman who lived in the woods down on either of our saw he uh she had a baby three months old we we allow\nAny way it goes on and on and and the baby doesn't farewell nor has she [laughter] so [laughter]\nSo there's a there's a little bit of fun\nAnd yes there in the stories in the absolute sacrilegious motherhood and this song you know and that's one thing I Love about the Irish they're very irreverent\nYou know there's so much we can talk about but I just want to finish off by talking about something that as a musician you must frankly are kind of tired of people have to play Danny Boy\nBut it's such a hit with travelers and it's always a pure jerk or when you hear it especially with Americans trying to connect with her Irish heritage help us a little bit with the lyrics have Danny Boy and and what it means to an Irish musician outside of tourism\nThere are a lot of Irish musicians who wouldn't do it anyway because it's been so commercialized but I think it's a very important song someone once said to me it Shakespeare and I think that's true after the great hunger when people would leave the country they would wake them because they would never see them again and songs like Danny Boy wake them may with the way\nIf you'd like they've died yes in the person would be there and if you ask the offender if it would be that send us they're leaving Ireland forever\nThe world was a much bigger place than and they would go by the uh it wasn't always safe and they would send money home usually but they've very rarely in the early days in Eighteen hundreds got home that's all changed now of course but Danny Boy it to me I Love as a mother because it is letting your child go\nIt is detaching from them with love and saying look I Know you might and come back and I may be gone when you come back but I Know you love me and that is a huge gift to give a child when they have to go\nSo now when I hear Danny Boy I have a little better context single ... single expensive than the\nNeed Pauli\nThe pie\nSo\nCall and hang\nFrom ... to\nThe mountain\n\nSo ... ... oh\nNo the knees or\nFall on ...\nTease him geez oh goal and die must I\nThought\nWell I'm not seeing\n[noise] or\nWhy you know\nJeeze\nOh\nOh\nMe pull\nMe he says oh\nWell thank you I've heard that song so many times but I didn't know what the context Cathy thank you so much best wishes and sharing both your love of music and your love of Ireland thank you for allowing me to you that the kids [noise]\n\n\nFor more than ... years there's been a message about how Nelson Rockefeller is Twenty one year old son is kind of pain dating we explored the ruthless one
