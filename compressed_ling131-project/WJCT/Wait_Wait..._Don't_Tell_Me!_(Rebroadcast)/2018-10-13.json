{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "A hundred degrees it was at one point looked at as possibly an\nUnstoppable fire it was so hot a lot of firefighters who I interviewed said it was by far the most\nChallenging frightening fire that they've ever confronted and their their careers until very recently it was the largest structural fire in the history of Los Angeles\nThe fire reminded you are just a phrase that the the many Senegalese have for us\nIt was an incredible phrase which is when someone dies a library burns down meaning the person's own\nHost of memories and stories and anecdotes that we store in our minds disappears when someone dies and it struck me as being a wonderful\nWay of seeing why libraries feel like these big collective brains because they have the memories and stories of a whole culture inside them\n[noise] we we mentioned the I'm more than a million books destroyed or damaged in Los Angeles but you're also staggered you're reading your book how much stuff there isn't a great urban libraries just stuff but we shouldn't be lost and LA\nAmong the things that were lost in the fire the library had\nEvery automobile manual for every making model of car starting with the model T those all disappeared patents that 'cause that's recording all of the patents in the United states and Canada those were all loss\nAnd artifacts like puppets from a famous puppet theater that exist in the forties and fifties\nPeople look at libraries as being these repositories of\nI guess what you would just say are the flotsam and jets some of thinking and storytelling and those end up in libraries\n[noise] and to be sure there was a human cost to the employees of Los Angeles public library for the seven years it'd been burned and closed wasn't there\nIt was devastating this was the life's work of these librarians we think of libraries is just somehow\nGetting books but it doesn't work like that librarians build the collection of their department they choose the books\nFrom their own interests and knowledge and when those disappear you don't just go and click a button and replace them all I mean many of them are books that can't be found any more\nSo for these librarians it was absolutely devastating to see the books destroyed what I thought was really interesting as many of them suffered terrible anxiety and depression over the idea that they were no longer serving their patrons and they\nThe city hired a psychologist to meet with the librarians because they really were traumatized\n[noise] investigators began to suspect arson and suspicions began to fool around a man named Harry peak with respect for Los Angeles he struck me as real LA figure\nHe really is an or I should say was um he was a young man good looking blonde tall and ... inevitably began dreaming that he would someday be an actor because if you live\nAnywhere within the magnetic pole of Los Angeles that comes to mind he came to the city with no training as an actor and in fact he discovered he had stage fright sometimes I think what he really dreamed of was not acting\nBut living the way actors live or at least in his mantra nation or having a glamorous life having everything in your life just be larger than life\nHow many different versions of events that he did he eventually supply about his whereabouts that day and there's a huge\nHe had seven Alibis which is not necessarily recommend it if you're going to have [laughter] if you're trying to convince people that you didn't commit a crime it's usually good to stick with one\n[noise] but they never could prosecute him could there he\nWas arrested but they they never indicted him but the story ended up getting very complicated because many people in city and many many firefighters were absolutely convinced that he had started the fire\n... your take is one of the workings of the library today and and there's an are conducted digital age doesn't everybody have a library at their fingertips [noise]\nEverybody has information at their fingertips but a library\nAlso is a place I think what I began to realize was that\nEmotions I felt about a library were partly because oh it's so exciting there's so much great stuff here\nBut some of it was being in a place that I share with other people and we're all looking for whatever it is that we're interested in at that moment and there's something wonderful about that\nThere is also a lot of stuff that is not on line and that is going to remain true probably for eternity\nAnd in the original co working space too\nThat was the one of the things that I realized there was a period of time when I was working on the book and I just couldn't work at home anymore so I rented space in a co working space and then one day I thought\nI could do the same thing at the library and not pay so I canceled my lease and finished the book working at the library\nSusan Orlean her new book the library book thanks so much
