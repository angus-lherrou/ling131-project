{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "By two thousand Fifteen and said hey by two thousand Eighteen let's get rid of trans fats the ... to all food in the United states and that should happen pretty much any day now\nUm and that should work there's been some real significant research on back to New York state um where they got rid of trans fats much earlier they they ran a number of studies and one of them showed that uh regulations would reduced trans fats may have reduced the cardiovascular death rate by four and a half percent\nThere was another study that showed that hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in counties where trans fats in restricted were actually six percent lower than counties in New York where they had ... other countries\nHave also moved to do this Denmark became the first country to actually eliminate them in two thousand foreigners research in Denmark that shows that this is probably dropped the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease by more than fourteen desk for one hundred thousand person years which is a really significant amount unfortunately\nWhile we've seen a lot of this and developed nations it's been much slower to occur\nIn many countries which are on the poor into the social economic spectrum and North Africa in South Asia especially in the middle east\nA lot of partially hydrogenated cooking oils containing trans fats are still use both in home cooking and cooking from vendors that people might uh buy from on the street and even from restaurants and that trans fat is likely responsible for about half a million\nPremature death from cardiovascular disease every year this is so significant that while the number one and number two causes of death worldwide used to be respiratory infections and birth defects\nI'm In the last Twenty years scheme of heart disease and so we're vascular disease both of which of course are cardiovascular disease or the number one and two killer in the world now\nUm and it's thought that these two things occur for about Seventy five percent of deaths\nIn the low and middle income countries\nAnd the W ... chose call is to recognize that this is a significant worldwide problem\nSo uh when you say trans fat what is being transformed into fat is this a molecular change in the nature of the fat\nIt's actually it's it's high drawn to nation which means really were just admitting that at a basic level hydrogen molecules to the facts are and when that occurs one causes liquid fats to become solid which makes them easier to transport user to cook with trans fats\nHave a particular what people call my mouth feel like we like them they taste good it's what we used to make movie popcorn taste so good\nIt's what used to make many fried foods taste so good and it's been very difficult to try to get that same sort of mouth feel with non trans fats although people have no started to come pretty close\nUp but it it adding these extra hide funds on I'm actually makes the fats more unhealthy whether it's because of their bonding differently inside of blood vessels they increase the amount of plaque\nOr the increased the the rates of heart disease they increase the rates of death\nThey occur in very small amounts in animal products or in some natural foods but the vast vast vast majority of trans fats the we consume are things that we create or dental lab they're not necessary\nSo you and I have talked about the relationship between cholesterol and heart disease and it's it's less direct\nElation and maybe we thought is trans fat cholesterol or just a separate category of problem\nIt's a it's a trans fats or even worse when it comes to cholesterol because what they do is\nThey actually increase people's levels of bad cholesterol and simultaneously decrease people's lack of good cholesterol ... so you get this one to whammy punch where they are the worst thing you could and we've had we've talked about sort of\nAn saturated fat person saturated fat and you know the differences between does a and absolutely we could have a robust debate\nAbout the relative dangers of saturated versus on saturated fat that that I think even some people who truly emphasize that saturated fat as a problem\nYou know the science behind that is not nearly as strong as they'd like to be\nI Can't make that argument with trans fats I mean the the evidence is sort of so overwhelmingly bad\nThat it's very difficult to defend the continued use of trans fats especially since unlike with the the debate about saturated aren't saturated fats\nWere making most of them in a lab this is not something that sort of his naturally occurring in the foods that we would otherwise normally eat we sort of cooked up this problem and now we recognize there and we probably should just learn the lesson and and stopped using so many of these things so\nIt is a it's unavoidable problem and it's going to take some effort to try to remove these things and fortunately is WTO has no power to enforce this kind of bad it's just the first sort of a major worldwide push\nA and it will be necessary to try to get governments locally on board to try to do this but it's probably one of the most significant things that many of these countries could do to try to reduce the people's health risk from cardiovascular\nI'm not eating trans fats

is this a bait and switch to get students to read Aristotle [laughter]\nNo it's not a bait and switch we actually talk about zombies I came upon the idea because I was trying to figure out what is the nature of consciousness\n... give us an example of the kinds of things that you are grappling with\nSo most people\nAnd students included to consciousness to simply be awareness but scientists are now

I'm Jeffrey Tambor was accused by a former crewmember and a member of the cast of sexual harassment were those allegations a surprise to you\nA lot of focus has been on what happened there and we've had so much conversation since\nThose allegations happened about believing people who say they've been harassed or assaulted 'em and after the initial allegations you were really worried about the effect on the show and you wrote I knew it was over for Jeffrey and that meant more on the show or TV family my own family my parents' reputation everything\nAnd you acknowledge that one of the accusers was upset about that reaction\nI I Know you don't like to go into a time machine but what did you learn from that [noise]\nYeah I uh it was so interesting because you know I was with the people of time is up and an agitating for this notion of you know one of the things that I wrote an posted as I was like saying what do we want right now in this moment I wrote it unlock all ...\nAnd ... for not nondisclosure agreements I felt that what Hollywood really needed was to make an accounting of how much money had been spent to put tape over women's mouth\nAnd then I was faced with this instance on our show where some trans women and wanted to tell their story and I was confronted I think with my own transmit ... where I didn't immediately said to van and trace let's stand up and tell your story\nInstead I went a little bit into protection mode and as you said about the show and thought about\nEverybody's financial earnings I thought about what\nThe world would think of a show like transparent if it was connected with this reckoning\nWhat I needed to recognize but it took me a minute was the her I was so some of both trace and van for taking their stories and being willing to say them out loud and in many ways to sacrifice themselves and in retrospect I Would like a time machine and that one\n[noise] what's your relationship with them temperate now we haven't spoken in a little while [noise]\nThis is gonna keep happening right friends artist people we admire are going to come under scrutiny and it will be painful for their friends and their colleagues and I wonder if you have advice now for people who are in the situation you and\nFor me this was a time for emotional tenderness towards everyone\n[noise] especially towards the victims who are willing to sacrifice again it's it's a very sacrificial act\nAnd in terms of the ... and the people who are being accused I think it's really about men\nDeeply deeply deeply spending a lot of time and energy trying to understand how patriarchy protects their privilege and thinking of actual ways and tactics that they can take to begin to make up for the harm they've caused a for that to come back that doesn't mean we don't treat them with tenderness and laugh\nDoes that mean the same for ... for you\nOf course I mean Jeffrey Tambor as a member of my family I never want to put the protection of Jeffrey Tambor his career over the protection of trace laws that career and Ben Barnes career I think that's what happens is as a culture where naturally patriarch also we naturally go well what about him\nAnd I think there are a lot of straight light says men who have had positions of power and their expectation to continue and that power for the rest of their lives as part of what I think has some unconsciously demanding that they place their pain first before everybody else's\nShe'll sell the way thank you so much for your honesty they memoir is called she wants it thank him\nMm Mm\nMm Mm\nWeekend edition is a production of NPR News which is solely responsible for its content\nTo find out more about the books and authors you hear on NPR program go to NPR dot org slash book\nThere you'll find author interviews NPR's bestseller list and find out what our staff is reading [noise]\nThis is weekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke I the end of our\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Wallace Foundation fostering improvements in learning and enrichment for disadvantaged children and the vitality of the arts for everyone ideas at Wallace Foundation dot org\nFrom Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring John Slattery Amanda peach Paul Ryan ...
