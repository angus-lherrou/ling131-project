{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "It's certainly possible to travel almost anywhere and Ireland of New Guinea\nAs mad is still very remote and is difficult to get to the U.S not all Catholics today there's been no cannibalism since the early Nineteen sixties so it's certainly safe in that way you know you can go but it is definitely expensive and difficult\nYou know one of my most rich travel experiences was traveling to New Guinea flying into the middle of that island it was ... you were talking about the other half of the island but I imagine it's essentially the same culture and I was just fascinated by the people I met the tide communities and the humor and the music\nAnd the traditions that we're still visit in in a Traveller\nCould actually experienced those you could sit on a log with somebody chewing a beetle nut and a little kid ran by and and the men knew what kid was by the footprint he left in the sand and community that was so tight they understood there's no local word for orphan everybody takes care of everybody mhm\nAnd then as Matt they're fantastic tremors and singers and dancers and you know sometimes they will drum and sing for twenty four hours straight and all through the night and it's a\nReally a fantastic beautiful and kind of takes you into a different world and you know it's one of those things that I'll never forget there is\nA lot of a missionary influence and I felt there was actually competing missionary groups from different Christian denominations and or you know this will be Baptist this would be Lutheran this would be Catholic and so on it has a huge impact on the community what was your experience in that regard\nAbsolutely will traditionally at least in West pop the Protestants took the highlands and the Catholics took the coasts ...\nYou know for a long time and as Matt first there were Dutch missionaries and then those were placed by Americans after Indonesia took over from the Dutch even in ... in Nineteen sixty two\nAnd today there are fewer American missionaries most of those missionaries are or I should say just most of the Catholic officials or the bishop is a local or a local man but you know the most of those people are often very very strong Catholics but they're Catholics with multiple wives and\nYou know one foot in one world and one foot in another\nAnd I I think that the modern missionary work as a little more sensitive than the old browsing Bible stays and uh\nI Know when I was there the Lutheran Church from the first world was actually bringing in missionaries for Madagascar ... kind of work because they understood the temple of society and the respect for the local big man and it was a much more thoughtful kind of international compassion I think I mean the\nCatholic Church in as Matt where Michael Rockefeller disappeared played a fairly strong role in actually encouraging the a resumption of ceremonies and carving it had been banned by the Indonesians\nSomewhere sensitive to the indigenous culture I suppose indeed\nThis is so interesting to grapple with this as a first world traveler and for a lot of people there's this this sort of ethical struggle\nDo we want to bring the comfort and education and health care and the modern medicine to these primitive communities and call it civilization or is it more correct and more ethical just to stay away and and let them continue\nThey are traditional ways let's finish our conversation on New Guinea just with your take on on that ethical issue\nWell I think it's a powerful issue I don't think it's as simple as black and white as as you make it out to be I don't think you know first thing is not to call them primitive I mean they're\nTechnologically uh not as developed but they're very complex societies that are every bit as complex as western cultures and\nYou know I think the biggest thing is that you know it's not about what we want and it's not about imposing our own sense of development on people but travelling or a sensitive Lee and and listening to people listening to what they want and what they need and what their struggles are\nRather than you know using words like civilization or primitive and imposing our own values and beliefs on them\nHow much time did you spend New Guinea and near work with Savage Harvest I made two two month trips\nAnd of that four months you spent in New guinea as an American travel writer what was the thing that kind of shook up your ethnocentrism and and ... do a respect for the cultures or any particular example you could share\nWell I think when I Lived in the village and the village of ... for a month and I lived with the family and a man who was the head of the family coke guy and\nYou know I think everything about that experience was pretty profound you know I I think for me someone who's had this long fascination with indigenous people and you know we tend to think of them and very\nYou know we checked her own fantasies upon them and and imagine them as exotic or as objects really I think ... send a fetish eyes them in my experience ling living with them was just that they're complex three dimensional people who ah\nWho can't be easily uh put it in a jar and then we need to look at them in a much\nBroader way and then much big challenge for first real travelers and you become particularly or where that when you go to\nAn amazing and rich and yet remote culture like when you'd find a New Guinea and yet that's why it's um you know you can argue that it's so important to to make that journey yeah this is traveled trick Steve's who've been talking with Carl Hofmann his book is Savage Harvest\nCrops thanks so much I'm Glad that you had this this fascination in the Rockefeller story in in reading this book able to give us a better understanding\nAnd a better appreciation of the indigenous cultures in New guinea\nSuch a pleasure thanks for letting me

until events of yesterday\n[noise] and if you're a security correspondent Greg Myre thanks so much for being with us thank you Scott we're going to turn out to NPR's Ron Elving Ron thanks so much for being with us good to be with you got a first let me ask you about President Trump's reaction to these events because at the White House yesterday he said quote we must show the world\nThat we're in either together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens uh then just hours later a rally in North Carolina uh he hadn't yet another line of attack and they yes you know even at the white\nHouse event that you mentioned he said those words about peace and love and then he took off after CNN and others and to me you know\nAnd got the crowd chanting lock them up lock them up there is a pattern of the president first saying the magnanimous and presidential thing possibly reading from prepared remarks that may be on the teleprompter than pivoting to the spontaneous remarks that are his trademark\nSo again last night at that rally in North Carolina he began with this\nBe allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it\nAnd another point he talked about ending what he called the politics of personal destruction but moments later he was back debating the crowd with the name of Maxine Waters and outspoken African American congresswoman and teasing the crowd before saying I\nWon't say it um I I won't say it not clear what it was but in the past is referred to Maxine Waters as a quote very low IQ person\nI Want them to say I was being nice the president said\nTo left or from the crowd and\nDemocrats of course have um a level the charge that President Trump has ... helped to create this politically charged atmosphere\nThe president told reporters yesterday that that certainly his rhetoric couldn't couldn't be held responsible for what ever happened to put all these mail bombs are addressed to Democrats in some of his critics\nThat raises the question how much can President Trump be held responsible for the actions of this one apparently troubled men\nCertainly not responsible in a legal sense or responsible in a literal sense\nBut everyone should have a look at these rallies or ask themselves what the under tones and underlying purpose of these rallies might be and consider the photographs now circulating of the bombing suspect himself attending one of these rallies and holding one of these signs\nOf other news we need to ask you about President Trump continued to talk about the caravan a thousands of Central Americans who are traveling through Mexico to try to reach the U.S border there are reports this week the president's consider in executive\nAction that would block them from applying for asylum um do we need to consider the timing when we talk about this\nYes everything right now is about the mid term elections in ten days this this caravan had swollen to more than seven thousand early in the week yesterday it was down roughly half of that size or less many are dropping out the Mexican government is offering incentives for those who would choose to stay in the southern part of Mexico and that's an offer may\nMay be pretty tempting for many of these people to accept while others are going to press on to the United states and if they get to the border they will represent some marginal increasing the number who seek asylum at that border every month\nBut the images and projections of an army of migrants marching across Mexico descending on America and that was never the real story and it becomes less like reality everyday ten days from\nThe mid term just looked as if polls have been tightening a now maybe Democrats have extended the lead according to ah the NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll\nIt looks like ten points in the generic poll which party do you want to having control of the house so that's the threshold of a truly meaningful margin if it holds it would seem sufficient to deliver the house to the Democrats it would not appear nearly sufficient to deliver the Senate but it would suggest the momentum shift we felt earlier in October toward the president and his party\nHas begun to shipped back in the direction of the opposition NPR's Ron Elving thanks so much thank you Scott\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt coined a phrase when he told White House reporters

saying Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall\nPresident Trump has been in office for almost two years and has millions of supporters but I Wonder if even many of them believe the president has used his per show high office to other words that inspire\nHe's presided over rallies that chant lock her up\nA parade of Intel's this year's campaign rallies that those who have different ideas around a quote

course she's called depressed the enemy of the people he's praised the congressman who was halted a reporter Shane any guy who can do a body slam he is my type\nOf course some Democrats and other public figures have also used overheated rhetoric but as Mr Trump is at a number of times about critics I'm president and they're not\nIt may turn out that nothing and the president said set off the

uh but important moment there is enormous\nPain in the country and has been for a long time but there's an enormous viciousness in so much of the political rhetoric and of course it does start with the president and we we can't pretend that that is\nMockery in duration of his opponents makes no difference to plough political atmosphere I Wish we could stop there but we can't fix the truth is there is so much viciousness on either side on both sides that people don't really listen anymore to anyone but the people who agree with them and frankly the people who agree with them\nEnthusiastically that's a very dangerous thing it's not the most divided we've ever been we had a civil war after all a but it's a very dangerous moment in a moment when what we should be looking for on the national stage or the voices of calm and rationality\nLet me ask you about the history of this because a guy of course you mentioned the civil war I won't even try and make that argument but in in the Nineteen sixties you had the assassinations of Dr\nAnd Robert F Kennedy or you had the bombing of the weather underground you know George Wallace and open bigots running for president in ... in to run over protesters um with with your view of history what\nWhat does this represent in ours what's happened\nI think it is quite possible there were as divided as were the Nineteen sixties and in some ways it's probably worse\nIt's true that we had political assassinations the Nineteen sixties and you and I we're we're both coming of age then and it was a terribly difficult and and painful and in many ways frightening time and yet of course all of that we still had at the national level\nAre people who really for their job was to calm things down and you may have seen the uh Peggy Noonan the wall Street Journal\nThis week suggested that on Tuesday one week before the midterms but all the candidates on both sides spend the day talking about the virtues of the other party\nThere was a time when that kind of rhetoric was actually a common in America when people would often say of course I respect this and this and this is about my opponent you don't see that anymore and and I don't think that's going to happen on Tuesday\nPresident Trump has a has denounced the targeting a of some of his critics he has called for greater civility in politics um that ... has been called that's what he reads the teleprompter and then he'll\nHe'll go into a spontaneous ration like or like the one last night at his rally in North Carolina the\nProblem is I I'm all for greater civility I wrote a book about civility I Believe in it and people I think it's an important virtue in politics respecting each other across\nOur differences really trying to find our commonality but with President Trump calling for greater civility and and for calming things down I have to say the proof of the pudding is in the eating if he's going to say that and go on back to the way things were before\nThen we haven't gotten any further along if he's going to say that and stick to it ah then I think that would actually be a good thing for the country\nWhere and what about I suspect some some people um who are supporters of the president say look this man in custody was clearly troubled clearly unbalanced you can't blame anything he did um the president of the United
