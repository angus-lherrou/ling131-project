A.\nAnd to ensure that uh the insurance markets work more properly and that we can lower premiums and deductibles for everyone but\nThe ... let me ask Cher does that mean you would vote against repeal\nIt means that I Would vote to replace the Affordable CARE Act with with measures that fix it um\nBut I mean if there was a vote to repeal you would vote no\nI'm a strictly on a on a\nOn a vote of if that were the choice before us which I don't think we would hypothetically have that's correct but I think it's important to recognize what the Democrats want to do and what they're real agenda is is the single payer scheme which would make it legal employer provided health insurance it would double our taxes\nAnd it would create a death spiral with debt and deficit ... into the future and every single country that has a nationalized system like this has annual debates as to what they can afford to pay and what they will cover so these debates don't go away if you can do all the control over to the government\nI I'm sure Democrats would say or at least a lot of Democrats would say they certainly are in favor of a national health care system Beth way but I Do have to move on to uh to the death of democracy so sure of what do you think of the show the explanation\nIt's a very lame a it's an outrage what they've done a they their actions have been deeply offensive I think to a\nAmericans of regardless of political opinion here at home\nAnd I do think that um it's a very complicated issue for us\nUm we've got thirty seconds left complicated in in the Saudis have so much money invested here\nNow and the complicated in that we have a the major regional a adversary in that part of the world is Iran\nAnd the Saudis are aligned with us against the Iranian or a exploits and the middle east and so this is what makes it very difficult but I think we have to speak plan linked to the Saudis and tell them that this is going to change our relationship\nRepresentative John Faso of New York say thanks so much for being with us thank you my pleasure and on weekend edition Sunday tomorrow with loaded with thousands of central\nAmerican migrants are trying to make their way to the United states will hear from a reporter James Frederick was talking to migrants who were stalled at the border of Guatemala and Mexico you can tune in tomorrow by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name\nImmigrant advocates along with the American civil liberties union and the bus drivers you can\nDeliver two hundred thousand sign petitions to greyhound bus headquarters downtown Dallas on friday a Stella Chavez from member station ... reports the group is demanding the companies stop allowing border patrol agents under their buses the question passengers about their citizenship\nGathered in downtown Dallas part the protesters said greyhound has the right to refuse border patrol agents from boarding or bust it without a warrant or probable cause they campaign called transportation not deportation accuses customs and border patrol agents\nOf violating passengers constitutional rights by asking that they proved their US citizenship\nIn a speech to the crowd Texas Democrat walking ... says practice\nIn heavily Hispanic areas beyond border checkpoint\nGreyhound is doing something that they don't have\nThey're subject to any of their\nThey're subjecting a warrantless searches\nAfter a series of speeches to groups fought several blocks to greyhound headquarters carrying doctors signed petitions Tricia Martinez senior vice president for greyhound's legal department read a statement from the IAU they bleach CBP officers do not ask\nDrivers safety aren't passengers and rent and stuff that are\nMore protests are planned in the coming weeks for NPR News I'm Kelley shot it in\nDallas [noise] ooh\n\n\n\nOoh\n\n\n[noise] and you're listening to NPR News\n[noise]\nGuy sitting behind a wall bulletproof glass like in the liquor store\nSomeone to put her on how\nAnd I need something to join us for more stories told\nPR Saturday at noon on eighty nine nine W.

G. God well visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage President Trump reacted yesterday and\nI think they're a real concern was that it not be in a place where mats grave could be desecrated in some way and you certainly can't blame them for being protective of their time after what happened to him\nAnd so I I worked with the national cathedral and indeed that's where ... will finally rest and I think it will\nBring a certain sense of safety as well as closure for the shepherd's who who really turned this this act of violence\nInto an amazing campaign on behalf of gay and lesbian bisexual and transgender a young people everywhere\nAnd what do you hope the size of his remains will be for a lot of\nPeople at least for the next several decades I'm hoping it will do two things one is is to help people to remember that we all have a tendency to make people who are different from ourselves or the other\nAnd then to do terrible things to them and it's important that the the hate crimes bill that was finally passed is named both for Matthew Shepard and for James Byrd the um African American who was dragged behind a truck until he died\nBecause it it links all the marginalized groups who experienced violence against them\nAnd the second thing I Hope is that it will be a constant reminder\nThat this work isn't done I'm more than eight out of ten\nStudents in in our schools here in America report bullying and harassment over eight out of ten that's as of last year so we're not talking about things that happened only Twenty years ago but actually continue to happen what\nWould you hope to the young men are young woman who was wrestling with some of these issues would be able to to walk into the national cathedral and\nFeel at home and ...\n... let's remember the church\nHas been the source of much if not even most of the pain algae B. T. people have faced I'm the condemnation that has traditionally come down from a Christian churches\nAs cast us in such a negative light that these three fellows who who beat Matthew Shepard to death they felt um okay about that they felt justified about that and for Matthew\nTo come home to the Episcopal Church which he was a part\nAnd for the LDP T community far and wide to to see a church welcoming him to rest there in the cathedral forever is a huge statement and I'm proud to be associated with it\nYou know who he will be resting near well I Do know that in the crypt in addition to Woodrow Wilson\nIs Helen Keller and her teacher and Solomon and uh\nI think that is the perfect place for Matthew\nA great teacher and uh someone like Helen Keller who taught us all a lot\nAnd thanks to match parents' we've all been moved to action uh and I think in some ways our heterosexual allies more radicalized by his death and so there are very many more people fighting to end\nViolence against us Bishop Gene Robinson thanks so much for being with us thank you Scott\nAnd you're listening to weekend edition\nFrom NPR News thousands\nOf students in Florida are waiting to know when they can return to their classrooms as the panhandle tries to recover\nFrom hurricane Michael storm severely damaged more than half of the schools in Bay county and left them with no electricity or water for some old remains our foundation walls Steve moss is vice chairman of the bay county school board you joined us on the line from Panama City Mr marsh thanks so much for being with us\nThank you for having me what do you need now well\nThe educational needs of our students are still taking a back seat to just the humanitarian needs that they have just a basic food shelter clothing water and just the basic they lie\nYeah do you have anything resembling a timeline as to when you may reopen schools\nWe hope maybe mid November if you saw the devastation that is really an aggressive timeline because so many of our schools don't have power or running water or electricity or any of those Internet service any of those things you normally see a out of school we didn't want to make sure all of our seniors graduate\nOn time and that most of our students are able to promote next grade level so to be able to do that way to start as soon as we can for sure\nMr marsh how do you handle the fact that I'm I'm sure a lot of students are are in families who have lost their homes and and they're staying with relatives or had to move to other places and to the districts must be all mixed up by now\nIt really is and for most of our communities we have basically thirty six schools about twenty six thousand students in our school district\nAnd there are several cities within our county and within each of those cities the school is often times the hub of that community especially for a lot of our students that school the only with the community but that one state place that they could rely on it shut off the times the life of our kids\nAs pretty rough and so we're trying the best we can to rebuild those communities through rebuilding our schools as fast as we can but for a lot of our students it'll take years to get them back to where they were before the hurricane ...\nDo you have any schools that escaped damage or or or at least having been hurt so badly that you you can't use them\nWe have between six to twelve of that argues well here's the dilemma we're coming up with the schools that are severely damaged we can't use\nBecause they don't have power electricity the schools that were damaged\nOr not they use that shelters for the time being and and maybe for a CEO or future\nMr marsh I gather that despite or maybe even because of the considerable losses if you've had and challenges you have um they're still going to be a football game Saturday Night\n[laughter] yes there will Scott and I have a feeling they'll be a lot of folks there that are sports fans but they're coming there just because it's a way for our community to come together through of all things a football game\nOh that sounds nice do you have a cheer you can share with is\nWhat the team that's playing out mostly dolphins yeah of all things and so the ban will be they're playing\nAll the cheerleaders will be there and we're trying to have it look as much as a regular football game would be a even though we understand that a lot of athletes that'll be flying\nAre living in shelters and do not have to return to after the game but a lot of our student athletes their extended family is their cheat\nAnd so it'd be a way for them to reconnect with their teammates and their extended family on the football field\nI don't get a vote but go dolphins\n[laughter] with the absolutely Scott\nSteve moss is vice chairman of Florida's bay county school board thanks so much for being with us they shot\nThis is NPR News\n\nThis is Ira Glass this American Life and I'm coming
