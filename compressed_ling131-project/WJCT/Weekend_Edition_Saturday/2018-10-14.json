pediatrics at Indiana University school of medicine also a regular contributor to the your time's up shot call\nDr Carol how are you I'm good how are you are you going to brightened my day or dark at my day I think it'll be a combination\nSo I thought we might talk about a a a pretty recent study that appeared in the journal the American Medical Association that that this is supposed to answer once and for all which was better for us we're for losing weight a low fat versus low carb diet uh and they just cut right to the chase the answer is it just doesn't matter\nUm this was a huge study of over six hundred people all of whom were overweight or obese who were randomized pretty full year end in nutrition studies a full year as an attorney\nBut they were randomized for a full year either to be on a low fat diet or a low carbohydrate diet with the idea of being let's just see once and for all which of these works better and they had plenty of education they had plenty of help\nThey stuck in these diets for a four year there was lots of follow up to see if they were sticking to it at the end of the day they did defer significantly in what nutrients they were eating the low carb group was definitely lower and carbs the low fat group is definitely lower and fats and at the end of the day the differences and the weight loss was\nWas really not different than all I mean it was they both lost weight overall which is great\nAbout five to six kilos double that you know ... to to see how many pounds it is\nBut it it didn't make a difference and given how much people argue about what is the best diet it is good to know that look they both seemed to work a little but but the the really isn't a difference and that we shouldn't get so hung up on that one of these nutrients is the bad thing for us\nHas anyone done a study of not what type of diet but whether the entire notion of a diet is really practical in the long run I mean do people or you know some of these TV shows\nYou know they come back a year later and you know that they came back a lot of the way it is a diet something people can actually effectively stay on for a reasonable you know like five or ten years is anyone ever studied that\nUp they have and that well I mean I should I I was gonna say they have right up until you said five or ten years ago because five or ten years now I mean like there's no I mean we just don't do those kinds of studies\nUm this study was interesting in that at least try to go a little bit further so the first thing they did was that they advised everyone to eat less processed foods they emphasized toll booth emphasize better diets and general I'm ... but the they didn't tell anybody\nRestrict your calories they just were interested in sync and your shift away from carbs or could you shift away\nFrom fat but here's the interesting part all of them without being given the message of\nLets you know let's reduce the number of couch it in all of them reduced their calories by about five or six hundred calories per day an intake and that was just in the message of\nThink about what you're eating try to get away from processed foods\nBe a bit more mindful about it so\nThere's some confirming evidence that trying to get people to think perhaps about what they're eating to to try to be more mindful about what they're consuming to to maybe you can get away from processed foods tends to drive us to diets that also have fewer calories and\nIt might be the component that makes us lose weight\nIsn't there some other element to this though which is that\nBeing in a study when you have support in other words a or your community where you're eating community um isn't that support really the essential ingredient in all of this for losing weight not just be ... hard to be mindful on your own\nSo maybe um you know I think that there was an initial contact originally and then it sort of drifted off and you could be corrected it is the part about being in this study that makes a difference but I Do think that you're you've hit the nail on the head it's it's got to be slow steady change it's gotta\nBe you know what can you do what will you stick to and of course I've I've advocated for a long time and the best diet is the one you can stick to run\nThe certainly the one you're reading a book it's whatever you can sustain over the long term\nIt's going to be the best people in the same way that when people ask me what's the best exercise routine I said the one you will do every day or five days a week for the rest of your life not not that there's one for every one I also want to point there was one more fascinating part of this study because I'm sure some of the listeners might bend have this question on the tip of their time\nOne of the interesting things about this study was actually even went so far and looked at people's genes\n... there's a lot of fat these days that say certain people because of their genes are predisposed to be better on a low carb or a low fat diet and they have a few genes that they've already identified as this has something to do with insulin absorption with this one has something to do something else that these people have the genes that predispose them to a low fat diet or predispose them to a low carb diet and there's a lot of\nBusinesses went out test or genes and try to\nPick the diet for you well they actually ran those genetic studies and then looked at whether those people were more likely to lose weight on the low fat or the low carb diet and it also made no difference at all costs even this idea that somehow or genes are involved and then we could identify what people will do better with low carb or low fat\nThat's not proving to be true either and so all this fancy science that we keep bringing into play to try to come up with some magic solution is to find an easy way\nFor people to lose weight or pick the best died for them\nYet none of it appears to work and then we'd probably still once again have to get back to simple basics of what are the changes you don't make that are simple in your life that you can to stand over the long term to try to get to a healthier way\nUnfortunately all of his always comes down to self control right\nWell I mean I I find that person every time I think it's also how much are you willing to to cook for yourself I'm often baffled\nBy people that I see we're willing to put in an hour hour and a half and the day or you know driving to the gym changing their clothes working out\nAll over the idea that this is somehow going to make them lose weight when all the studies in the world show that it's not exercise but but nutrition that is ... with weight loss\nBut if I say why don't you cook for yourself I have no time and if they would just spend half that time in the kitchen learning to make food for themselves they probably could do a lot more towards getting to a healthy weight and a healthier diet than than all of this effort in other areas\nMan I'm that's great do exercise do you cook the I'll let you go Dr ... thank you very much and thank you\nFor this week's show you can listen to our podcast on

enough\nAlready we have to stop with political correctness Americans have been choking on political correctness\nFreshman I guess you can't you know freshmen anyone can say first year you can't say right actually measure discriminating goes when\nHe seemed culture liberals supposedly love it conservative can't stand it or at least that's what we've been told but a new study by the group more in common shows something quite different political scientist Josh among wrote about this survey for the Atlantic and I asked him to explain the results\nFirst headline is just how many Americans think political correctness has become a problem at all country it is actually four out of five to eighty percent of Americans feel worried about what kind of rule but it plays in our disclose among the second big surprises that this was sort of narrative that young\nAre women perhaps people of color tend to really like political correctness and older white men are the ones who deeply opposed it and what's really striking is invest not at all what you've seen the data right the best proxies or education level and income\nUp sort of a white people are actually slightly less likely to fame for political correctness is a problem than people of color but people are most likely to see it as a problem or a Hispanic Native American\nIn the same way in terms of age very youngest um don't like it any better than older people on the other hand if you are moving a hundred thousand dollars a year if you have a post graduate degree venue much more likely to like political\nCrap [noise] the reason is is so interesting is because we often portray the country is divided right hopelessly your analysis says that there is quote and exhausted majority whose views are not actually so different from one another uh can you explain what that group is feeling right now\nYeah so it's easy to think of it as sort of fifty percent of the population\nWill walk in every single way I'm On a sixty percent of the country who are just sort of racist and really don't care if we have lots of hate speech and what we see in the study is that eighty percent of Americans dislike political correctness and eighty two percent or were you worried\nAbout a hate speech so most people are not racist but they also a little concerned that if they say the wrong thing a base stress themselves a little bit wrong me they might somehow a come off as being hostile when but not so you know one of the people\nWho was talking in a focus group said look you know nowadays I\nI'm not quite sure do I say do do I say Jewish too as a black or do I say African American and I feel like if I got the wrong people are going to shout at me and and that's where this educational divide comes in\nBecause the kinds of people frankly who you know listen to NPR every weekend to perhaps have a higher degree and so on they tend to be more comfortable knowing what to ride what's on what's that invest a lot of Americans who have good intentions who don't have faith in the hospital but they're just unsure about what was to choose\n[noise] yeah I I Want to take the term Latin acts um which has gained popularity I'm Latina and and if I talk to members of my parents' generation they feel entirely excluded from that term the term is meant to be more inclusive write 'em but these terms can also make people feel like they're not in on the conversation\nYeah and that's what we just have to be self critical about what's actually going to achieve more racial equality in our country if you think that for your own political reasons ... is a better term to use than than Godspeed to you but I think if you talk to your fellow citizens and they care for example about the ways in which\nHispanics are being discriminated against at the moment the United states but they don't use your ... thought Tom\nI think you should see the potential allies rather than denouncing them or as enemies\nWell how does that work how for example kind of politician run on progressive values um where the language doesn't alienate what the survey says the vast majority of the country I mean how does it practically were\nBut I think that's a huge difference between\nStanding up for minorities that are under attack and talking about is no way which sounds like you have a sort of laundry list of all of a different groups that you have to win over in order to win an election and I think that was the difference between how block Obama talked about it\nAnd how Henry can talked about it actually I was struck for example by\nThe way that Cory Booker argues for a set of progressive causes when he talks about why does the we have to have more equity in high school education\nShe always she talks about the fact that it's unjust to the children and poor school districts who don't get a good education but he also talks about the fact that we need to educate all of our citizens to the best abilities because we're in a global race of competitiveness with China\nWhen he talks about a prison reform doesn't just talk about the injustice to the people who are imprisoned usa talks about the huge costs to the tax payer I think those are ways in which you're making the argument that is close to your hot but you also trying to show why does the business in everybody's interest [noise]\nI can hear liberals listening to this conversation and say you know that's fine but the fact of the matter is the other side weaponize his words in a way that that that we cannot cede the ground and conservative listening to this conversation might think\nThey're always trying to label us as racist and and the divide has become so vast in this country that people are listening to a conversation about something like this in totally different ways now\nIt is a problem but some people on the old right for example use popular discontent with political correctness in order to get a license to spew things but as straightforwardly racist\nBut I think the right to sponsor that used to have a little bit of a sense of humor to say yes look we can sometimes be true invested in whether the appropriate thing to say is a Latino or Latin acts\nBut you know what that's not a reason to deny but we have deep injustices in our country come join us in the political side or to make this a a country that lives up to its principles better when it starts at the moment\nHas shrunk you can read his piece at the Atlantic website he's electron government at Harvard and the author of the people versus democracy why our
