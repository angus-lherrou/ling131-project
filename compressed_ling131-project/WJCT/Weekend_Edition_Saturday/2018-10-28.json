K. I'm reading it comes to a\n[noise]\nYeah OK and now should be [noise]\nWell I Would say be is clearly crunch year and a better chip pressure to write a from a distance yes I I Would say that's true you know what\nIf I were to tell you that those two ships were identical and the other one was definitely louder man\nWell I was playing Fritz with you Chris but it was not by getting closer farther from the microphone my friend Jared here on the sound board run down the volume for the first ship and put up the vying for the second ship okay well we just replicated a famous experiment\nExperiment by a researcher named Charles Spence in the u._k.\nWho did this experiment by having people eat chips all the ships are identical they were ... and he had people eat the ships in front of a microphone while wearing headphones attached to the microphone for it and he adjusted the volume so some ships sounded louder than others and what he found is that these sounds that foods make when we bite into them\nAffect how we perceive that they taste oh I think that's\nTrue well of course has some Blumenthal you know the famous chef in England you can actually put ear buds in and listen to the sounds of the seeds you're having a seafood multi course extravaganza right\nRight oh yeah he he he gave you an eye pot at your table you would listen to the sounds of the ocean while eating seafood and people received it would be fresher ah yeah it\nIs obviously has strong emotional sound has has a lot of effect on your emotions and your perception yeah\nAnd and actually the research shows that association of crunch even extends to the bad the connection is not as strong with the packaging as it is with the food itself but there is still a demonstrable connection that when the packages noisier we perceive the chips themselves to be noisier and fresher impressed crispy crunch here\nOkay that that's you know I didn't know that but it makes sense now you mentioned you know these other anything other than potato chips where the packaging has a sound association\nThe other thing that I'm fascinated by is not just the sound that foods make one\nWe eat them but the sounds that are made in the cooking process and what we can learn from those sounds so I mean look at it the best most obvious example is says All right when you put a piece of meat into a hot pan or onto a grill there should be a ... that tells you that the may our reaction is taking place the browning reaction\nIf it doesn't make that sound you're in trouble true and I learned recently that there's\nSomething you can learn about scallions you can tell whether or not you're slicing them correctly based on the sound really oftentimes I feel like in the movies are on TV shows you see people chopping scallions and they're doing very quick up and down and you hear that\nThat's out of the hard hitting the cutting board chop chop chop chop chop and that's wrong and that's wrong right why\nBecause when you prepare vegetables like scallions you're supposed to slice through them to get a nice clean slice if you whack 'em upside down you bruised them and you don't get a clean cut\nThat's right and and when you when you press down too hard on them your ear released and be more acidic components of the onion as opposed to a clean cut which keeps those cells sealed and allows overtime the sweetness to come through so\nI have some audio samples for you here you're ready yeah go ahead here here's the first clip this is that shopping this is the incorrect way to slide scale you\nSee here that hard shopping that vertical motion now let's listen to the correct way to slice guy is this is a more horizontal slow smoothed slicing instead of shopping\n[noise]\n\nSo you you hear that Chris [noise]\n\nI I Do and that's the notion of shopping is really a misnomer the in the kitchen because you rarely actually chop ... you should be slicing most of the time that's right I agree that's good so we've gone from potato chips disguise\nAnd the point is that you can learn a lot by our food based on the sounds that they make there's so many cues and we eat and we cook\nAnd and I think a lot of folks out there like you you maybe subconsciously already aware of you sound like when you're waiting for water to boil over you're putting her pasta and so that you could be in the next room and you hear that sound of the water bubbling and that's how you know it's time to fill the pasta and there's a lot of audio cues ... think of food and cooking as an audio\nExperience but in many ways it is [noise]\nThey ... they get so much sound and food or the new frontier I didn't they stress\nThat within passionate about this for ...

rated memories without the profanity because we are PG it's Sunday October twenty eight twenty Eighteen the news is coming out now\nOf course [noise] so what is your reaction to this\nSo what we see here is is really the result of an a a very tragic an unfortunate pattern and trend of the rise of extremism any anti Semitism over the past several years\nIn calendar year twenty Seventeen we saw the largest single increase of anti Semitic incidents in recent times we saw in nearly a sixty percent increase in anti Semitic incidents and twenty Seventeen over the previous year twenty sixteen\nAnd we saw nearly a Ninety percent increase in anti Semitic incidents in case through twelve\nClassrooms in schools across the United states before we get to why you think this is happening when you say anti Semitic incidents ... discussing when we're talking about an anti Semitic incident at a at a school in a classroom and a K. through twelve\nIt's everything from a ... a swastika on a bathroom wall\nTo instances in a and most recently in a western state where a a student um made very callous and cold references related to the to the death of Jews and the Holocaust is part of a Valentine's Day project and so it really takes all different shapes and forms just three weeks ago here in northern Virginia\nA I was at the Jewish community center in Fairfax were Nineteen swatch because we're spray painted on the side of a really a community center where people come to exercise and an whole community based events so it really takes all forms\n[noise] why do you think this is happening now\nI think a couple of things that ... in in recent years I'm there has been a normalization of hate and extremism both online and off line\nThat the normalization of rhetoric and from the highest levels of re tweets of individuals like David Duke from posts in and re statements that are associated with white nationalist in this country has has almost become normal or part of a a a global discourse\nIn addition to that uh the political divide in this country has become so toxic and when combined with the normalization of this type of hate speech in anti Semitism has really led to a volatile atmosphere that we've seen play out just in the past week\nOh so this week or a bomb was delivered to the home of George Soros is also Jewish we've seen a lot of trafficking of conspiracy theories about him on mainstream conservative TV news like Fox even\nCorrect and in fact in a ... a deal recently released some reporting\nUm that goes back in ... a lot of the conspiracy theories and they have their roots in anti Semitic conspiracy theories as well this is something that we've unfortunately seen play out um both in the all flying an online space as\nSome of the most vitriolic or anti Semitic attacks against tourists and others um have really come out uh in the past year or two and it's something that you deal will remain constant in vigilant in combating on a day in and day out\nBasis we should also say this shooter um was also trafficking in these conspiracy theories he apparently believe that the caravan coming from Central America which has been repeatedly disgusted by the president and others are was being sponsored by Jewish organizations correct\nOn one of the Jewish organizations that was mentioned in some of his his post was highest an organization this tremendous work on on refugees and ... as well as the Anti Defamation league I mean there were several posting comments in his open source social media um\nThere were many victims in this case a that we're in Pittsburgh and beyond and it's up to us as a global community of citizens in organizations to remain vigilant and push back against all forms of anti Semitism discrimination and bigotry and we're committed to doing\nSo George saline senior vice president for programs at the Anti Defamation league thank you so much for coming in thank you\nAnd not to Brazil voters there are choosing their

and\nThat's the hope of how we get out of where we are today\nI agree with Karen I'm I Do think though that we have to consider the power dynamics um so the president of the United states has a uniquely powerful position to amplify the messages that he's sending out in ways that\nThat the rest of us don't I also think we need to think about the impact of this rhetoric on immigrant communities in the United states there's research documenting that pernicious health effects\nPeople are afraid to send their kids to school they're afraid to go to the doctor um and so you know we

eleven fairly well\nYou have spent time with these families can you tell me what the reaction has been in the wake of this\nYeah I spent a little time yesterday I have to say with before that people really knew but these were people who hadn't heard about their relatives some of the day went on a sort of became clear that the news was not good\nUm these are wonderful people good souls who are just coming to synagogue 'cause they usually did they were synagogue is just\nGetting started and mostly elderly people who come there or there at the beginning and you can count on them every week for coming I'm In a mentioned the one woman\nBoroughs who in her nineties you know but she was one of the younger ones among us I have to tell you in terms of her spirit\n... she a hundred years old\nBut ... just a rose was wonderful and and um I mean and the brothers and all of them I'm just such wonderful sweet souls and it's such a prime\nOf their lives were taken from us\nYeah you were at you will not at the synagogue at the time of the shooting that you did arrive on the scene shortly after\nThe yeah I live in I live in the community I've grown up in Pittsburgh uh lived here for most of my life [noise] um what did you see\nWell there was a quarter and you really couldn't get close to the synagogue so basically I came down it was right around the block from where I live and\nYou know I I wanted to try to convert people and try to do something whatever I could do and I ran into some people who were waiting to get to hear about their relatives who we know where they're\nAlso to see some people who I thought would would have been there some were delayed by traffic or were sick or whatever it might have been and didn't make it there um\nAnd uh it was just the\nYou know when it hits it hits home if it's it's um extra hard to deal with\nYou spend time also yesterday at a Greek center what did you tell people how do you counsel people about something like that\nYeah well I think just being there for them and letting them know that there are people there for them you hogs and letting people cry on your shoulder and and just letting them know you again you're going to be there for them and um I I did have to\nTo tell one I'm a woman that her brothers [noise] the one of her brothers who I knew at the time has been killed from what I had heard and I have to tell her that I mean that's part of\nSome of it's been so hard\nIt is very hard but it's part of I think being a rabbi um but she deserve to know what I knew at that time um as far as there are other brother I didn't know at the time we did just that know what the story was\nSo there was that uncertainty there um there were a lot of people that are helping who came to try to you know Pittsburgh is that
