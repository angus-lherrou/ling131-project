{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Milk street dot com it's time to visit from my kitchen and Cambridge for a chat with wine expert Steven muse Steven how are you good growth uh finally we have some wind the taste not always the case in her white quarter but there is why did they yeah uh and so what is it working\nWell Chris we're going to be talking today about three aspects of wind that are important but they often don't get talked about very much now these are acidity bitterness and\nStringent see is like the this is a character summation of me [laughter] I mean I don't like this is like my man we're\nGoing to start right off here talking about acidity\nNow it's a city in wine that gives it a sour on tart quality\nRight wind always has acidity it's an important element and making wine refreshing appetizing and drinkable and the acid in a well balanced wind she chose to fit in\nNicely shouldn't be too noticeable but it needs to be there now we're going to start Chris just by putting a little bit of this white wine this was a ... made on the French rent land a coast [noise]\nAnd you have a go with that nice fresh perky little wine you know I mean it has um [noise] it has a certain sour quality to well bells okay so let's do this I'm going to put in\nA little drop of lemon juice and I'm going to have you trace it again so what you're looking for here is not the flavor of lemon but to see whether or not that little extra edition of acid doesn't highlight its presence in the wind so that you notice it a bit more you know it's more overpowering [noise] as I say I have a balance\nYou say it's out of balance now okay\nSo this is a little experiment Chris that it's really worth while doing at home\nTo help you identify the role that acid players in line and the reason why we want to learn this is because again when you're talking to a retailer or ... and they begin to talk to you about the acidity in the wine you really want to be able to know what they're talking about\nSimple to say okay so let's move on to bitterness here and now bitterness\nThis is something that in my experience tasting wine with people they often confuse\nWith acidity but bitterness is a really different thing\nAnd if you think about the bitter foods that are on our tables or things like greener herbs or bitter chocolate and chef snow that mixing bitter flavors on the plate often enhances a dish and it's the same way with wind we often get these bitter flavors would want\nSo um I've actually brought along the line that I think illustrates this this is Lynn Briscoe\nIs characterized by a sort of big hit a fruit right at the front and then as the trails away the finish begins to show a distinct note of bitterness ...\nBeing a better person he likes the bitter one oh yeah it's true that it ends with a very clean bitter ... which is really nice\nBut appealing and the one of the reasons that we love limber scores because it goes so well with\n... what's our favorite go to one for barbecue just for the very reason I'm OK let's move on to a stringent say I don't even know what that really means well to find out yeah\nI'm going to hand you\nA coffee Easter you know and I'm just going to ask you to\nEat it [laughter] just chew on it a little bit what does that sensation\nIt's ... it's drying yeah yeah so a stringent see is something that we appreciate and wind particularly when we are\nCombining it with something meaty like a protein protein has some fat the stringent in the wind has the effect of cleansing the palate\nSo that we don't feel overwhelmed by richness what does um astringent tastes like unwind we're going to taste one here\nThis is a very interesting what I'm saying made on the eastern coast of Italy in the market\n\nSo on the finish ear something different than what you tasted in November ...\nI wouldn't say it it has the feeling of tongue to presser but it does it does have that certain drying effect yeah it does really dries out the palate so we have a city with bitterness and stretch and see how do I use those as a informed wind consumers\nYou look at it well it's important to be able to recognize each of these elements in wine as a separate entity right it's particularly useful at the table we need a city to keep things appetizing and ...\nWe need bitterness often as a foil to foods that are a little bit rich\nUm and we you mentioned Bruce go for barbecue for example we love limber score with barbeque just for that reason and a little bit of a stringent see is important to clinch the palate particularly when we're eating something where there is some\nFat involved so you throw that nice beautiful New York strip on the grill and that's when you're reaching for maybe the California cabernet or the boy do which both have an element of the stringent\nEven take it from one as stringent mentored other uh welfare thanking\nNext Christmas that was one expert even you know\nPutting a military I spoke with journalist making the cared about the death of Tex Mex cuisine you know she's pessimistic about the future of Tex Mex cooking she says the compared to barbecue Tex Mex just doesn't have the attributes the central to social media success\nWell I disagree Tex Mex has all the ingredients for success including crowd pleasing food which is ... a lot of plates\nAnd real history all it needs to make [noise] so if you're Jose Andres ... please consider Tex Mex your next project you might just save the cuisine as well as the families that are still

from Washington\nAnd so that was really I think the final push that made me decide I Need to at least try to find answers if I can and you were surprised by who you've found\nYes I was I think I was always imagining maybe becoming close to in some way my birth parents one or the other or both what I ended up finding or sisters in particular my only full sister Cindy\nAnd you know we've become incredibly close and that was\nThat relationship was not something I I looked for not something I Would have expected and her daughter is my daughter's only cousin you know I'm getting to see them the next generation grow up together and seeing them grow old enough to ask questions about our family and how\nHow it came to be and how we came to get back together it's just been really really special\nThis book is really honest and very ... about your upbringing how did your parents respond to reading it to sort of all of a sudden being able to see all the things that you went through\nI was anxious at first I'm sharing the story with them I knew I very much wanted to write it and I knew I wanted them to see it\nUm and my father actually passed away my adoptive father passed away in the middle of reading it in January of this year and thank you um but by the time he passed he had read most of the parts that he was in and he loves it he really appreciated that one of his goofy joke state and\nSo people used to ask us all the time like where did they get you meaning me and my father would say oh if you put a polling a Hungarian together you get a Korean like where do you think they came from it's terrible joke it was his way of kind of saying maybe you shouldn't be asking the question [laughter] um one thing that my they both said to me was that\nThis isn't the book we would have written about our family or about your adoption but that's okay you know it's your story it's your perspective and I think they're proud\n[noise] in the book you have the scene where you are asked by a couple about ... what do you think of having been adopted a which is a pretty heavy question to ask anybody um and you write at the time that you weren't honest with them about your experience what would you say now\nYou know I think in a way I was I was honest to a point but I wasn't willing to kind of scraped deeper I remember sitting there thinking should I tell them about like the bullying should I tell them about all these questions that I\nHad and all the times I I wondered about my birth family and wondered why they've given me up it it seemed like a lot to lay on them but the main thing with that\nI had not put down this burden that I still felt um sometimes I still feel to be honest\nOf China meat people's expectations as an adoptee because I Do love my family and I do want us in some sense to be seen as just like any other family and I\nI Want people to think that I to look at me and see like a happy grateful well adjusted person you know um it was very difficult sometimes still is difficult for me um to go beyond that and to sort of complicate that narrative but\nI Do think that there are a lot of important questions that people who want to adopt traditionally could be asking themselves many many are\nAre you going to this realistically and have you really looked at your family your schools your neighborhood your religious organizations if there were a child of color coming into your environment what would they find when they find mostly white people or would they be able to find people who shared their background and people they could connect with\nYou know I think if you're adopting across racial lines you know that is the beginning point\nNicole Chung her memoir is all you can ever no thank you very much thank you so much Lou [noise]\nOoh\nYou're listening to weekend edition from NPR News\nAt the Melbourne Zoo the monkeys are no longer allowed to eat bananas and the pandas are getting pellets instead of plums in fact fruit has been phased out completely that's because the fruit that humans have selectively bread over the years has become so full of sugar\nThe zoos fruit carrion animals were becoming obese and losing teeth\nSo how did fruit gets so sugary and what does that mean for us humans were putting those questions to food writer and author Frederick Kaufman who joins us now welcome to the program\nOh hi how are you a great thanks um so how has changed since humans intervened in this process well\nListen sense about ten thousand years ago and the origin of agricultural human beings have been messing around with the ... where what you're looking at is\nNatural varieties which are puny which are tasteless which have no smell and uh the farmers were like we can do better than this and they started cost breeding almost from the get go\nI didn't think this was going to go to mediate leader the sex life of plants but apparently that's where we're headed um I mean why though has modern fruit become as sugary as it has\nWell one of the mandates remember here is Nineteen thirty which is one of the United states ... a pastor's the plant patent act and from that point forward the idea is we're trying to\nEncourage farmers to actually manipulate those plants and to make them sweeter and to make them fat or a and\nAlso to make them see list to take their sex way in fact what's happening is is that when you when you actually take the sex drive of a plant the way when you take away it feeds it actually could puts more energy into getting fat and sweet\nWhen you read about how fruit um has impacted the zoo animals were you surprised\n[noise] uh no not not at all I mean as I say for years now we've been lobbying\nThese natural varieties of almost everything about them except their sweetness you you look at a watermelon there is no seed was watermelon dish the full of just white red luscious fruit there's nothing like that found in nature of the tomatoes you find in nature are tiny and taste with\nThe apples you find in nature or almost all of them are better as people don't realize that everything we're seeing in the in the supermarket they're like superstars are like supermodels and and athletes like long James that's what we're looking at the supermarket\nTo let me ask you because eating the super model of the of the ... well it doesn't sound like necessarily a bad thing I'm you've written a book about this kind of stuff that the farmhouse food stopping food is part of the problem has it become less nutritious is it just good looking and less good for us\nI think that the argument among dieticians is is that is that yes the higher sugar content is robbing\nA suitable a lot of it's a nutritional value and I also think there's a tradition in America of somehow seeking perfection through our food that somehow if we equal white we will make ourselves mentally and spiritually\nBetter and so of course if we see row after row perfectly glistening absolutely gorgeous completely look like Apple's we think yeah I walked back\nBut fruit is still good for humans\nOf course eat like your grandmother told you to eat is probably the best uh the best

in suburban America\nAnd I try to talk to people and see where their heart is they were outraged how judge Kavanaugh was treated as well as Dr Ford\nIf anything I feel it's suburban women have really waking up and said that could be my son that could be my husband sure but we know how and that will work calling most polls show that most college educated white women\nBelieve Ford suburban women make a decision every time they go to the polls as to who they're going to support they are not\nPart of this wave and this is ... when they are just going to all go left and you really have people for example look at senator Collins\nBy no means ... consider hard right but when she look the evidence and puts it to the historical ends of looking at the Clintons and essentially how Bill Clinton was aided and abated by his wife while he victimize young intern I mean there's a certain point we have to say enough is enough\nAnd we need to get down to the business of leading our country and who better to do that than women on both sides of the aisle in this last month\nWhat are you running on what's your pitch to getting people out to the very simple\nYou weren't ... matters you are going to

executive director of the liberal packed democracy for America welcome to the program for having me pulling this week shows the enthusiasm gap has all but disappeared [noise] what do you make of that Democrats have momentum scenes they lost it\nYeah I'm not surprised that it's changed a bit of courses tightening we're past Labor Day this is when people start paying attention to election\nAs the Republicans continue to dig deeper and deeper into the whole they've dug for themselves with the cabinet appointment I'm we're going to see that we have a very very energized democratic base if we started at a ten which is where we've been for the last six months this certainly turned it up to ... eleven or a hundred\nBut this was a pretty brutal last but the Democrats I mean I've heard many Democrats say the Democratic party gets out played all the time you're going into the midterms with a huge loss\nAs that's certainly true but you know this was an unlivable fight from the beginning we don't control the house or Senate we don't control the house but don't control the presidency\nAnd now we don't control the Supreme Court ah and I'm proud of the fact that you can see that the Democratic caucus held almost completely together a standing against it to fight regardless of whether or not they're going to win and we fought on principles and on values that's what the American public wants to see from us and that's why they're going to reward us on election day\nBut that's what the Republicans say that the Democrats are trying to bring this nominee down no matter what
