for you to do that\nIn in a not quite sure I've heard that a lot of questions from the residents of the district um but I Know the response they've heard for me is and when they ask what quality\nAs you or why it all starts with a love of God um I I tell them and I shared my story my story was never really shared from the very beginning son of a Baptist preacher\nSo my mother was a social worker

party what can you to move that project forward so that I'm a resident in that district I feel like a war\nAnd thank you for the question ... that's a very good question we've we've heard over and over again about neglect and district in regarding to infrastructure so how are you going to you you just talked about your your relationships how you're going to use the relationship to to move somebody's projects forward\nBut yes certainly that was one of the first things I'm a punk coming in that I did was to get an update of where we're at\n'em and septic tanks definitely at the top of the list of of many residents are in the district and so it became a top priority of mine um we know that that is a big issue to deal with 'em to date where we're at built more\nAre we are that project as fully funded uh it it is it actually scored highest and it was out of the top three number one but I mean there's going to be a foreigner in the it is a priority as if it were were they have a timetable to\nThe timetable would just be like in the discussion of the budget and getting in and getting early and fighting are coming in when I did was such a limited time leading up to things\nUm it was definitely brought out that it was a of points to me\nBut are trying to identify those dollars and find them um because it's not a small number but that's one of the issues that you

morning good morning soul to restore are talking about um no water some of the numbers wrong for domestic borrow it from\n... in this age now where the ... the climate that we've been hearing more about domestic ... and ... women altogether so just a little bit about or worse what's going on in the community and what we what we don't know about ...\nWell I can speak for Deval county and Hubbard house we see well over forty five hundred people a year that we provide services to and if you know anything about domestic violence that doesn't account for all the people because some people don't come forward and what we're learning is that when people don't come forward\nTo get help from Harvard House or their local shelter that those are the people that are dying shelters provide life saving a life changing services and we want people to know that we're here to help as well as the other shelters\nAnd that's true for St Johns county as well for the ... center\nOn last year we saw 'em over thirty five hundred individuals that came to us for all the different services and so I kept our shelter continues to be over capacity um I Would say forty five percent of the time so you know people are calling it coming in\nAnd that we really need to get the information out to those that you know need further services for nano ... county\nDo you nominate people lost their lives or results or for domestic bars from our intimate partner um the no ... is there something specific that would be I mean drew would paint a picture for us here in our in our area\nWell in ... county in two thousand Seventeen there were Fifteen domestic violence staff nine of them were due to an intimate partner violent\nSome of them were the partners or boyfriends girlfriends husbands wife but to other people to one was an adult daughter who is there to help her mother and when he killed his partner he killed the adult daughter as well and one was a three year old child who was shot and they had dead in front of his five year old brother\nSo domestic violence not only impacts intimate partner it impacts family members in impact other people in the area it's not just a crime that isolates itself totally to the home because we also see an overlap between domestic violence and people who are committing other mass shootings as well\nSo how do you ...\nWell in St Johns county we have a full array of comprehensive holistic services so what we want to do is look at that survivor\nAnd really wrap services around them to to give them safety but also support so you know we provide emergency shelter legal representation counseling you know other variety services that we offer to support that survivor and their children and you know have to remember that\nThe majority there's about half of\nSurvivor population that come into shelter editors children so we're working with children on an individual basis and as a grape is well\nI Would agree with Joyce what she said they do in St Johns county we do at Harvard House as well and then another part that Joyce and I've been talking about for some time and she's actually been at the forefront of this is really pushing batter accountability if we\nHold batters accountable that's the people who are doing the crime so we can protect the victim which is good and give them options in services in support but until we get at the root of the problem and hold batters accountable when I mean we I mean everybody in the system the whole society than we are not stopping it where it starts and difficulties\nThat ...\nWell actually in St Johns county we have a pilot project for which is the what the first one in the nation and so what we do is we have a better accountability specialists\nThat works within our child welfare system and what a Joe does is engage the batter into making sure that see if he wants to work with his um case plant or a department of children and families or if there's an injunction protection he makes sure that\nAll of the task or followed as well that's required of him or her on the injunction for protection\nAnd if that's not being followed than what he does it he'll call 'em held to a to order to show called to the judges and then the judges brings them back in and either they will comply with their requirements or that we can be consequences for that so it's been a real successful program so far\nAnd we're really looking forward to continuing that perhaps maybe state wide\nMistletoe how'd you get the message to women from there to protect them ... women don't report don't come for because they feel like they can't be protected ... corner\nDirt out or get loose will get free is not going to be held accountable to the point where they're making fuel fresh\nHaving shows like this and other venues where we can talk about the services out there\nYou mean hotline number at the state wide hotline number one eight hundred five hundred and one one one nine people can call that twenty four hours a day and get help there is somebody at the other end of that line who cannot let them look at what resources they have\nBut also just to let people know that there are so many ways that we can intervene not just Hubbard house for Betty Christian center but also the police the police here in Jacksonville are very good responding to domestic violence we have very good relationship with them\nAnd the courts really do care about what happens with a survivor is just very scary for survivors to come forward\nBecause the batter as often told them if you come forward I'm going to kill you and that can be one of the most dangerous times for victims children extended family is when they decide to get help and or leave the relationship so calling a hotline first and thinking about a safe way to do it is so important\nHere I think it's very important for people who want to know that information a number of you might want to give you one more time\nYeah it's one eight hundred five hundred one one one night and I also want to add to that [noise] excuse me a collaborative partnerships with in your community is extremely important the cat you know\nHow about ... can't do it alone Betty Christian center can't do it alone so we need to um work with our partners in our community but also we need the community as a whole to be a part of the solution\nAnd at advocates we want to be the voices for those that are in fear of speaking out but also when the community comes together and support survivor than other survivors are more comfortable coming out and speaking out against issue\nAll right thank you very much for being here this morning oh dear pat and would harbor house and Joyce mayor ... river center thank you for being here\nThank you for having art you

L. on at\nFlorida not navy a very real very young man he looks like a guy who understands the city and it's a different kind of leadership presentation I think has signed those optics really really fascinating I don't know who's watching what\nI was you know to to piggyback on what you're saying I was talking with some people who are fairly new to the state of Florida and living in Jacksonville and that was the one thing they said they were like wow this news conferences with the government look very staged and this person was there and everything was here and everything was in place and I said well\nThat's how they're always done and you know for me because we we've normalized it so to speak because we're so used to he speaks here and says you know what you know we can replace your home and your property but not your life you know you can email now and it was about it\n[laughter] you know that even thought of robotic and then the person to tell me what kind of bothered me as you know as a vet but that navy\nAnd he comes on with that and then you know you're a okay yeah so I Am\nAnd I believe you were here for this one four years ago when the governor or staged his his grand opening second term uh announcing he's running conference at a local business here in Jacksonville and he had employees of the business behind him all staged waving Scott science stage they were standing\nOver here all be there\nIt was on friday I hear you saying that like unusual\nManufacturer of news events about his age management to governor comes\nTo town anyway you know it would no matter what\nYou want to see the point I wanted to be a little bit more relaxed when that's when something's happening when there's a dangerous situation you don't always have to have it so stage it's okay to be natural\nTrying I'm trying to imagine a lax Rick Scott\nHamilton after here because it it cuts both ways going back to the governor's race for\nSecond of you've got Andrew Gillum and Tallahassee yesterday he did um\nStarted off with a chainsaw spent forty five minutes chain selling trees a camera crew from his campaign was they're filming a reporter asked and said well it's a public event he has a right to film but is Andrew Gillum guilty of using the storms of sort of burn issues reputation don't share your not\nYeah well I think we see this all the time we saw it locally with Irma I think we see it all over Florida I think we see it in every state that uh has horrible disasters\nAnd I don't you know we don't know whether the people tire of it or not I do think it has the potential to make people deeply deeply cynical yeah and we're cynical enough already\nHas a good point but I think the the idea of doing your change song trees and using bad in a commercial is staged and his goofy and is the world in which we live that that's where politicians do\nIt but there's always the issue that we don't we don't elect people based on you know a technocratic sort of um you know let me show you exactly what I did behind the scenes that doesn't work very well for a commercial so yeah they chainsaw downed trees because that is the type of thing that works in the commercial or at least has the potential of working when\nYou know a shot of the mayor sitting in an office to just you know monitoring the situation and you know said that's not good TV\nYeah and fight for nine to nine three seven for your call them we've been talking about the Senate race a little bit already but I Want to work that in for real of Governor Scott has built his reputation restore management however there are ... remembers a nursing home desk during Irma ... that\nThat sort of sex couple of days up as the governor has taken an interesting tackled the ... campaign he decided to basically the pause at the debate was supposed to happen next weekend CNN\nUm he said Governor Scott looks for the debate and go will have no time for campaigning in the next few weeks as he focuses exclusively in recovery efforts for foreseeable future five four Ninety two or three seven for your calls but I Want to talk about a scarf campaign strategy here I mean sure it is a campaign strategy right to say I'm focused on recovery of not campaigning\nYeah well I mean I'm not sure that any of us understand what a governor does when it comes to relief and recovery and rebuilding a watch this for almost Thirty years has a plan therapist so I Can't tell you what politicians to do in the space um what's frustrating to me simply as a citizen on a boat or is the power of incumbency in print media\nYeah so I mean the amount of free media that the governor will get that his opponent will not yet\nBecause he's the governor and we're all paying attention to what the state apart is going to do going to say about relief and recovery in the\n... or ... it's not like he's running and somebody who's not in office I mean you know I think squandered um times where he where he probably could've used that power of incumbency on his own but frankly I think that Scott saying was postponed debate was probably a canny move that the thing that politicians are we use fear is\nThat ... burns and there is a um a value and basically saying you know I'm I'm going to go and governor I'm ... and whatever that is yeah I think a sure he said I'm pretty sure that there are people in emergency management who are actually doing the rebuilding and doing the\nYou know the answer beside of thanks and actually you know helping people get on with their lives um other than change song country's politicians are not showing up to help you rebuild your house but I think it's probably a better look than focusing on the politics\nBut we can't get to a place where a politician hopes for a horrific hurricane a month before a major election I mean that's disastrous for the electoral process\nSo I mean I Would not have all these cynical over their phone cynical but I'm\nSure having your own campaign advertising in the past myself I'll be thirty plus years ago somebody was pre planning and going you know the worst time for the hurricane season is October ... right before November ... contingencies just in case that said\nThere's no need for advertising\nAll you had to do is look at Twitter yesterday and you saw Governor Scott was their TV stations and news media outlets were showing video of him on the helicopter tour he was out there without even having to lift a finger to the news of the governor out and working and looking was there\nFor good or for bad reminds me of the days when governor grand used to do work days and the news media would shoot it but I don't think anybody other than maybe one of his staff with a film camera was there to document it wasn't a create an event for a later at it was because governor brand wanted to get out there and meet people and it looked good\nIt didn't look good for reelection purposes it just looked good\nYeah and and actually you know this one is your take on this angel number to take a call you know ... Bush when he was governor he had eight hurricanes within the span of less than two years you know and Jeb Bush has been kind of the gold standard you know for hurricane response I mean is this Jeb Bush to blame for Rick Scott's posturing they're [laughter]\nBlame it on ... blame it on ... you're right it did start back then but then I think it's some of the things that we've been talking about how Rick Scott\nCan continue that with the navy had as Dan mentioned right you're going out yeah doing these things the anger showcasing that and going back to the power of incumbency of you know what their lots of things that Bill Nelson is out doing but is the media covering that\nNo they mainly shelling okay because he's the governor he's the governor but\nThen there are things that Bill Nelson is doing that as a senator he's a U.S senator that we're not doing so you know what partly asked the question could Jeb Bush would be to blame maybe sell ... ladies\nThat are available as you heard about the way you must be hard to say they're gonna blame me Jeff Terrell from Keystone heights um we're taking your calling first 'cause connects welcome\nThank you I just wanted to say that while I was sitting in my kitchen and Keith lovely Keystone heights and showing breakfast listening to first coast can act I was really disgusted in very unhappy at the sounds of of what the panels were saying\nIt was very petty if you could hear yourself I Do believe he would be ashamed petty about talking about a governor Scott's election and\nA Mr Nelson ... election and Rhonda Santa says\nI'm I think it happens all the time and I think it's it's one reason why we as voters to stake heat in what they're really doing to help us not what they're doing in photo ops I mean I ... continually goes back to the\nPhoto op that weren't Governor Scott did a quick uh fly and after that like a shooting it landed a posed with Lenny Curry smiling with his thumbs up that's on the dead on her one of the things he did that while there were body and the more people more\nAnd I think the smile by that some people are more into shows and it's it's a tip that that really demonstrate their their willingness to this is a situation or their own game the other thing I Will say about Bill Nelson he was interviewed shortly I Believe it was CNN\nAnd he said his job there and he clearly made the point that he was there to survey the damage\nWhat was needed in order and recovered recovery credit has\nTo go back to Washington and make sure they got what they need but that was his role there and that's what he was doing so he may not have been taken a photo lot with this leads rolled up moving to break but he's they're doing what we speculated that senator\nYeah hey I have only I think ... observation about how Nelson how she reports Nelson's a response in his activity might be a huge um\nChange in how we practice American politics and older politicians seasoned a you know whether he's exploiting it or not I wouldnt pretend to say but the observation is here's my job I'm going back to Washington to see what I can deliver for the people are ... and ... and that says\nIsn't that his role we've been talking about the roles of you know we've been talking about what the governors supposed to do with them they're supposed to do and what is a U.S senator supposed to do you know is that that was his role like to do that to saying hey take it back to Washington here's what we need in Florida to lead to let his ... his colleagues now this is what we need here in our state\nAnd that's where the issue of those nursing home death I think it's actually important because if you look at the the doing of the job bad that's not the photo op it's actually you know the the safety and security of citizens and\nYou know have nursing homes are are having people die in them arguably because of state not action that's more of a condemning thing then um you know being able to stand up and say\nHey Dan hum I wanted to come back to society nodding during the call when um the caller mentioned um the photo op uh slash news conference after landing shootings\nWell I Will tell you that that victim was the most grievously injured of the Thirteen who were injured on\nBecause as a game or to be shot in the hand\n... right through damaging to fingers because we talk to the mother afterward that\nMeans his job his career I Know you can minimize it's gamer but that's what his job was and now the question is can he returned\nAnd the mother had a news conference and I've I haven't seen a news conference like this forever at university not University Medical center at us fans Jacksonville with twenty seven journalists from around the country\nAnd she held on very well about how our son was doing but yes that photo had been pop earlier with everybody smiling and then later we find out he wasn't that happy\nNo and then and really you know this is something sure I Want to bring you in on this too because you know when when the mayor was posing mayor and the governor but the mayor was smiling broadly and you you saw that treat everybody the same all saw that tweet was that sweet appropriate\nWell I'll say it was political yeah I'm going to say politically appropriate um I think it probably depends on your perspective so we're talking about politics is it effective I don't know\nYeah I mean it's it's definitely something that we're going to keep coming back to because of the crime issue something that we talk about time and time again on this program about talk talk about his again now um Jacksonville city leaders um mayor Cory sure of Williams say attorney Melissa Nelson\nI'm David interviews with friendly media outlets this week\nI'm One of ... Gibson quotes I'm Talking about the gang issue curry said weren't happening is largely gangs regarding street violence we're working and collaborating together to solve it\nI'm sure if where you said you have about one percent of our population you know maybe a hundred people and hundred people whose names we knew by the way we were involved these kinds of activities I'm Dan you you've covered this stuff every\nDay I put my head down every morning and it never comes back up I never surface because of the amount of crime in not just Jacksonville but what we're experiencing in northeast Florida clay county was a place this week where a lot of nasty things happened including what appears to be a serial\nBank robber not just grandma or grandpa who needed lunch money this guy was sentenced in twenty ten\nFor hitting banks across the southeast and now it looks like he's back out there again yeah I mean I've heard this from the share of before and the sheriff's office does have a gang initiative where they're trying to reach out to a gang members to stop them from going any further uh in their life and telling them that if they do step over the line we will be there to get you and they do arrest them\nBut I Will tell you that there are a majority of the shootings that we get on our emergency alerts are exactly is the the sheriff says they are gang related they are gangs masquerading as music studios as rap groups and\nThey get annoyed with each other and they take the battle to the streets I just wrote up yesterday a Fifteen year old boy shot in the back of the head on the west side\nBecause he was asked where if he knew where some lead was as he was walking with his older brother he said no I don't do that stuff and it was attacked and then shot while now gang or not that makes you stop and your\n... going to say that that that is different than I think what people perceive when they hear it's gang related I I think we've probably still have some\nYou know decades old view and our mind of what what gang Seventy sitcom yeah exactly and and and that that type of thing is obviously a um an area where violence is prevalent but I wouldn't call it out your traditionally gang related\nBorn of one of the more important things I think that came up in in even the interviews they gave us this idea of we have to deal with the children I think that that is one of the areas where Jacksonville has failed\nIf you go back and look at Michael Jackson journey the entire point of it was you get these kids you get them at a young age\nAnd and you change the trajectory of their life but the results aren't going to show up immediately and and as as a city maybe as a country we're not good with this idea of invested in children now to solve the crime problem Twenty years from now but that's really what what I think needs to be done\nTime he had a caller and hope that that was talking about investments here he's been on hold for a long time and I I waited to get to him till now the only piece Scott called in a failure on first 'cause connect neurons house was on your mind\n... yeah so my main concern I agree with the lady first caller a some empathy is definite need it and the\nBuilding and\nMe to back that way and let the first responders do they need to do is full as happy people of my main concern you know get the feeling of jak Soviet expecting for under a grassroots lead us to say\nThe ceiling when it gets so has\nFour hundred million dollars and they are not able to decrease class and it's been going over ... over ten years and my main concern here is that the see the object Sylvia has no empathy for decreasing class\nA gay keep putting the the issue on one side of the town when it's the same in a situation here when it comes to crime but when it comes to uh having community grass roots leaders involved\nThe leadership uh keep those colds when you have meetings with the leadership right on with a grassroots leadership\nThanks Dale didn't take another call I'm Willie from Murray Hill Marino a Willie you want to talk about banks go ahead [laughter]\nGood morning I'm On on on comes you know I'm just show up with a fellow at the top of that and I voted for him\nAnd the mayor was a just a touch though what the solved it for them to just sit it trying to say you know crimes on one side of the towel and if they would put more money like four hundred million dollars in damage ... in\nThe educational system you wouldn't have a lot of this crime you know you do all this gives the buildings were all let's nuts\nBut I'll just tell you why you know and it's easy especially you know are in a trauma Jacksonville you know we're still a serious issue problem but it was such a long time\nTo use it as a black people do the black side of town when really you're not doing your job that\nYou're not doing your where we get somebody to do the twenty first century like you know\nRight on when you get so\nHey thank you will you appreciate your call 'em you know Tim Angel I want to get you in on this because you covered city hall during the off and brown years\nUm you were you dealt with an office in the big criticism or brown one of the ways was crime he wasn't solving the crime issue we're three years from now and brown on the body so pile up in the streets you're still talking about street gangs you've got\nYou know William Scott Nelson there all the same generation and yeah we're not seeing movement for these people refer\nEli danger of going back to that that issue of uh\nYou know make it looking at his all through a political lines I there is an irony of the idea that Cory did run against brown saying oh you know you didn't solve public safety and and now you have\nIt does with so many of its exclusive TV series Amazon Prime video presents only the first two episodes today as a series premieres subsequent installments will be doled out weekly as they are on broadcast TV\nAnd unlike the past two drama series on which Weiner worked his own Mad Men and David chases the Sopranos this new series does not tell a continuing story it's an eight episode anthology drama\nBut we're such modern anthologies as ethics is Fargo and HBO's True Detective telling news story with a new cast every season the Romanoff is an anthology series in the purest sense\nLike the twilight zone or Alfred Hitchcock presents are such live golden age drama anthologies us play house Ninety in Studio one each episode of the Romanoff stands alone\nMad Men was a novel delivering one chapter a week the Romanoff is a collection of short stories distributed on the same schedule each episode looks at a different person who is or claims to be a descendant of the infamous Romanoff clan\nBizarre and his family who were killed by Bolshevik during the Russian Revolution of Nineteen Eighteen\nThe stories Weiner tells here as writer or co writer and as director of every episode or set in the modern day but in various locations around the world I've previewed only the first two episodes which isn't enough to deliver a final verdict on the series is a whole\nBut some judgements certainly can be made both of the opening movie length installments are sharply written compelling we performed and confidently directed they're beautifully photographed\nAnd just like anthology shows on to do they go in unexpected directions because none of these characters are actors have to show up for the next episode and there are some episodes specific quirks as well the opening installment of violet our is\nSet
