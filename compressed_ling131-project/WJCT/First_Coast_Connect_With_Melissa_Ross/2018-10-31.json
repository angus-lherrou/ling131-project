of our first magnitude springs so effectively covers nearly the entire land area from Pensacola to Orlando\nUh because we're such that we have such a blessing of London perspective spring of ... state governed by that law\nOkay ah another ah\nArea that has been a flashpoint in this race is gun regulation a Adam Putnam the incumbent a\nCame under criticism when it was revealed that his department issued gun permits to some Floridians before the background checks were reviewed the department of agriculture and consumer services does run the background checks for concealed weapons\nPermits or you voted against the gun control bill that passed after the\nMassacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school you have an a plus rating from the national Rifle Association certainly that will drive a gun rights proponents to your column what would you say to those who differ from you on how the state regulates guns and how that should be managed by this department\nWell this is uh\nPolitical question my my wife's a school teacher my daughter's in public school ap euro interest in seeing guns play a be a feature of our public school environment\nYou know what happened in Parkland is both the school district and the share of failed to address an individual who had demonstrated history of being a danger to himself\nInto the fellow students in his school and that's where I wanted to focus I think where we should focus middle hell\nSchool safety features that dealt with guns in that bill or none of them would have had any impact on what happened was cruise they were totally unrelated and it's really the the tragedy of that kind of build a building\nThat you people run down the road focusing on something that they claim as a solution and you don't really make progress on it\nUm I no one should get a license for a concealed weapon state if they are qualified and if someone's not doing their job is was clearly the case of twenty Thirteen or they should be fired\nThey won a transition after the election hopefully I'm In a position to make this decision we're going to review the entire concealed weapons program top to bottom and make sure that I'm personally satisfied safeguards replace that again both of those metrics or bring that no one gets allies but they don't deserve it then everyone's doing their job\nLet's go to some calls now for ... called while the Republican candidate for agriculture commissioner Robert is in Atlantic beach hey Robert good morning go ahead\n[noise] good morning call while I question how would you feel about uh you\nEver heard of her [noise] banning certain there's [noise] doing Florida [noise]\nWhat ... what kind of businesses Robert\nAsked comedy [noise] finance kind of how much you pay a predatory that's comedy than [noise]\nOkay ah let's talk about things Robert let's talk about the fact to that in addition to guns crops\nA medical marijuana has come up in this campaign how that would be regulated you wouldn't be in charge if you're elected matter of uh all these consumer related affairs a regulating businesses regulating the states do not call list that has been a big bone of contention for Floridians who find it a new sense when they get\nRobo calls and then wanted calls\nHow would you improve the way the state manages a all of these consumer related issues [noise]\nShort and this is really a big part of the job is making sure that\nWe're protecting seniors when you think about how large or senior population here is in this state and how much of a target we are a and it comes down to investigation and prosecution or you're going to be constantly trying to follow the scammers follow the con artist\nOr where they're moving to the next new shiny thing uh and and catch them in the act and and really\nTake seriously the prosecution I think that the the uh the key part of it is\nYou know we have such a focused and rightfully so in in our local courts going after individuals who commit murder bass of drug crimes are in financial crimes or actually sometimes don't seem to rise to the same level and and that certainly going to be a focus for myself and I I think the other cabinet members will\nUh to to the caller's question I I think\nSome folks might not know about a decade ago of Florida and maybe a little longer than that but in a cap\nOn the interest rate it can be charged a financial services to actually a half to commit to certain interest rates depending on what kind of loan product it is but they can't discharge whatever they want and they can't charge predatory fees in terms of this state we also work\nWhile I was chair of the house issued a natural resource issues we dealt with international issues so ah countries like Venezuela Iran or those directly oppose Israel oh we pass a law in the law\nBut you are no longer allowed in the state operation to do business with company based in those countries who align with those values and against the United states and again a consistently bipartisan it took a stand those the third largest country in\nA state of the country and the Seventeen parts of the world are we could have a real impact on you've got a question I'm certainly glad to have demonstrated history of speaking to them\nOkay he's Matt Cole bombing Republican candidate for\nAgriculture commissioner overseeing egg and consumer services for Florida the election as one week from today so get out and vote Matt Caldwell thanks so much for being on the show [noise] absolutely appreciate ...\nThank you for being with us and a new poll out this week from you and a half actually has the latest numbers on that race for agriculture commissioner along with were the voters stand on a lot of other issues too they'll choose for governor senator and more Mike bender runs you and ask public opinion research\nLab and joins us now good morning for morning thanks for having me and here's our question to callers have you voted yet\nDo you plan to wait till election day who will get your votes for governor senator and those other races on the ballot like ag commissioner\nThere is it's a big ballot it's a big ballot this time and you need to get out and make sure you vote and you need to call us right now with your thoughts about all of the politics is floating around the state as we lead up to November six it's fine for nine to nine three seven to join us\nFive for nine to nine three seven okay\nWe will talk about that race in a moment the act commissioner race but I Know you want to lead off with what you've got at the top of the poll\nThe governor's race Andrew Gillum Enron descent as you have new numbers out hot off the presses justice morning they were environment until right now or from your vaunted polling shop on the U. N. F. campus Mike bender what does the polls show\nWe have that Andrew Gillum up six points on forty nine to forty three over on the sand is with seven percent still in the ... no column haven't quite tuned in and figured it out just yet\nA six point lead for going to finally forgive them to do to follow his lead is outside the margin of error it comports with or some other polling that's been done recently and and the real action or is in the NBA category the damn ... others to the nonpartisan uh that's really where a Gomez making some headway\nYou're seeing independence break for Gillum heavily heavily and do you have any deeper data to show what's driving that support for him among non party affiliated voters\nWould we didn't go to deep into why they're feeling that way but I but I think if you look around at the country uh NBA disapprove of Trump and greater numbers the scene is is tied heavily Trump\nI give them a has a charisma about him that I think I think attracts people if you could watch the last couple of debates I'm not sure that dissent just came across as well to the NBA's certainly to his base absolutely use adored a book but beyond that I think he's having trouble reaching spoke to Florida\nIt's five for nine to nine three seven let us know who will get your vote for governor senator ag commissioner and more as we talk about the latest poll out this week from you and ask Mike bender okay and in Florida it's fascinating to watch how this voting bloc goes Mike because it's one third of the state it's one third\nIt's a third of the state but the problem is during the midterm election you're not going to be twenty percent of the electorate so this is a turnout type of race if you can get your base out there you're you're in much better shape but those twenty percent do come if they break heavily for one candidate or the other it will absolutely impacted\nFlorida is such a a nice such kind of state it's so purple that uh these candidates have to try to run up their margins a little bit in one county run up their margins on just to touch in another county it's all about the margin isn't it\nAbout the margins and and it's mass to change dramatically twenty sixteen or the the idea that you could win a little here and a little there and get their was flipped on at ten when Trump won enormously and the excerpts than in the white counties\nAs a way to kill the offshore drilling idea I\nDon't know the answer to that but the more options you have on there if you have somebody that supports one of them there are more inclined to vote no on it to prevent it from happening but Republicans are opposed to this overwhelmingly on not overwhelmingly button book by a margin and it's no it's only point forty eight percent to get to sixty is is very unlikely\nTo do that so the I the measure then to ban offshore drilling off Florida's coast according to your numbers\nIt does not look hopeful at this time I I Would I Would say no okay are you also polled on the president's job approval implored at forty five percent of likely voters approve of Donald Trump's fifty one percent imported disapprove\nYeah and Trump is done well in Florida he won Florida he's always had an and I I I hate to say this but forty five percent a decent approval rating for Donald Trump in the grand scheme of things that might not be but when you get to what Trump's approval rating is nationally and in some other states\nForty five percent is a bet fifty one percent disapprove which if you're a Republican has to make you nervous when you hear all these potential voters talking about how the national stage is impacting our vote choices in Florida a book about forty five ... about thirty five\nNow one final question ... as you've noted this race has become so nationalized these these statewide races and even some of the local races and the ballot amendments just in the last few days we've had a series\nOf staggering national events and tragedies we've had the apprehension of the pipe bomb suspect in South Florida we've had the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh a there was another shooting at a Kroger and Kentucky there a is continued uh\nUh you know the\nOutrage over ... a a caravan of migrants coming from Central America towards the southern border there are so many factors that have\nUh just whipped America up into this stew of unease and did this one is an anger and with one week to go something else conceivably could happen to further blow up this election\nAll true um but if you think about all those things that have happened and it seems like every day there's something new\nJersey ... attention span for American is so short yeah and do lanes in which you view these events having occurred due so tempted that I don't necessarily think that is going impacting obviously nine eleven type tragedy might change everything but outside of that I don't think you'd have much impact\nLet's take one more call from Mike bender of units public opinion research lab it's Melissa in Atlanta ... Melissa you're on the air hey go ahead Melissa\nHi yes I'm I just want to ask a question about the ...\nAnd all the ... Gillum\nEnded Sanchez and how they feel about education and\nI'm from weight reading on Yellen's website it said that\nHe would like to hold private schools that were the vouchers accountable and also charter schools accountable more accountability but he doesn't really flush out how he's going to do that so I was wondering if you guys could possibly address out or if you have any additional information about how he could possibly go about doing the\nRight things for the call Melissa and I think what he's referring to a\nIs a trying to get to schools that received those voucher funds are charter funds to help at the same trend or do they ... as a public school in terms of testing and rating I think that's what he's referring to write\nAnd then there's an argument to be made a certainly folks on the left are looking at the mine is being poured into this charter school that I wouldn't want a public ... hours as having taking away from the public schools and weakening map\nAnd doing so without much oversight or so so their argument relapses hey we need oversight we'd we'd get if you expect public schools performed we expect these schools to perform as well and Lucian somebody's charter schools are fantastic\nSome of them are not and and and they're out of business midway through the school year and your kids love painting or enters a lot of problems with some of those so those are all things started to kind of keep in mind\nRight ah and certainly I Would encourage everyone to go to the candidates website I Would encourage everyone is researching all the issues to go to I Would say the league of women voters usually has a really good break down on the ballot amendment and the major candidates and the major issues\nUh that's one you can also go to our website at W.
