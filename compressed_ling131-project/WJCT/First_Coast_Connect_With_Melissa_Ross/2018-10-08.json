as a method to attract big money to cure blindness Karen good to hear your voice again Oh thank you so much that you've helped draft a bill that in these polarized times has gotten some bipartisan support\nIt is indeed bipartisan and I think that's because this bill is a pilot is a pilot program to use a very carefully crafted federal guarantee that we do not believe will cost taxpayers any money to speed all the promising treatments and cures starting with blindness\nOver what's called the valley of death where\nPublic funding stops for venture capital and ... money kicks in the middle where you prove whether these promising treatments insurers are really going to cure or something and this bill create something called I bonds he y e bonds to test this idea\nOn the upside is an interesting upside for an investor who kicks in some money to help research blindness and let's say it turns out it was a great idea and it starts to take off they don't just get their money back what what happens\nMost importantly they do get their money back there'll be a package of projects in each bond\nSo that even if a few failed the taxpayers protected and the investor is very very likely to get its money back tend to Thirteen percent of the combat injuries and our last few wars are vision related which helped fix them and get wounded warriors back fully functioning in society\nAnd of course many older Americans are suffering from age related macular degeneration which robs people of site often when they're at their most vulnerable\nThis conflict could work for a lot of other

Community Survey um backs this up so something that was really fascinating was that\nTwenty seven percent of members of the algae Beatty community reported being a member of a house of worship but when you when you break that up and you look at African American algae beauty responding the numbers over fifty percent\nAnd so I'm an African American and black individuals are facing discrimination but they're also way more involved in their faith community and so this was really relevant in these different communities and come together to address some of the concerns in Jacksonville okay uh in Jacksonville\nIs unfortunately the place where there has been a rash of murders of transgender women of color so this can be deadly or as well as\nI'm an issue in someone's church or a family or face a place of work are you going to talk about uh that aspect of this\nAnd even I'm sure that will come up a you know I think some some people might be surprised that would be encouraged to know that are in a in the response to some of those murders that there were a leader these leaders are algae B.

race in El GB tea on the agenda this week the un F did you go to the big pride parade over the weekend there was a festival to uh give us a call five for nine to nine three seven Barbie is in Jacksonville Hi Barbie good morning\nOr good morning thank you for taking my call sure\nI just wanted to make a comment on my graduate of you and if you talk at the CJ for many years I'm Seventy four yeah big gay all of\nMy life and I have\nSeen a lot of discrimination and the LBJ a community and I I just do not understand how people say in a tight stitch they believe in God and Jesus Christ shoulders so forth\nCan turn their nose up to anyone you know that's like calm it I don't understand how they think that they can judge other people\nThinks Barbie thanks for sharing your your perspective on that okay you know we live in a world now where marriage equality is the law the land and abroad majority of American people are just fine with that\nI'm On the other hand there's still a lot of discrimination out there as we heard from her\nYeah absolutely I think\nYou know the the struggle with the the marriage equality um ruling is that we still have all these day to day issues of um of feelings of of being scared or not understanding different communities\nAnd I like to always focus on the movable mental so when we're talking about persuasion and there's always going to be those outspoken folks who um use either data or a scripture to communicate what their messages as opposed to whatever um that larger meaning might be\nUm very much like what are our caller and um talked about and so when we can focus on spreading um knowledge and connecting with that move on mental I think that's how we'll continue to to make progress on these issues of racism and homophobia and Matt ... may have more say about that from the religious perspective\nYeah I think it you enough we want students to know that a Elgin beauty cue and face\nA don't have to be an oppositional relationship in fact\nElgin be teaching people are people face and we have students are on campus who are trying to make that connection and we had an event last Thursday\nOr where we were talking about coming out in the context of religion and we had students who were saying I'm trying to figure out who I Am because I have this identity but also on religious\nAnd how to reconcile that we had on the show recently this kid named Seth Owen who's become well known because\nHe graduated as his valedictorian from pecan become park high school no um he lives up in that area a school up on the north side and he's gay and his parents essentially basically kicked him out because he would not go to the church of their choice\nAnd he said to them I I Want to go to a church just not this one because it's so\nA hostile to who I Am and so basically he ended up\nCouch surfing and through a go fund me account one of a lot of money to go to Georgetown University he was on the Ellen show just a week or two ago\nSo I think of him as an example of what you're talking about it as a young man who is a a person who wants to have a spiritual practice but wants to find a faith community that's accepting of him and that can be difficult for a lot of young people who aren't raised in an accepting face environment\nIt can be difficult and I you know we got a lot of phone calls from community members who are either young people themselves or parents are seeking algae Beatty affirming\nOr churches synagogues mosques et cetera um and because they're looking for guidance and to be able to find someone to replace that not\nNot just a neutron up and is able to affirm who they are and let them be who they are authentically are in their community is so important\nUm I think sometimes parents feel that they're doing the best for their kids when they enforce these very strict rules are guidelines or force them into um churches who aren't as affirming and the best thing that we can do it's accept our young people for who they are to support them and that um even if we don't agree with that\nI think we have a a minister on the line who has some thoughts about this it's Ken in riverside Hi Ken good morning go ahead\nI'm calling because there is support in the riverside community I'm reaching now a blonde riverside stop this church and all of them are easy to just hated\nOn

west side go ahead of time you're on the air\nUh yes good morning yeah so I wanted to echo that sentiment though I'm a I come from a a event jail local tradition and uh I participated in grade to I saw a\nSome counter protesters and pointed out that uh you know the Bible tells us that we should love our neighbor as ourselves\nAnd uh we've judgment to God and that's where I think we should all do\nThanks Tom yeah there were a few protesters at the pride events over the weekend but a such a sea\nChange from how from people in fact that I Know that have been involved with that for many years it's just a completely different situation from how it used to be\nAbsolutely and I was talking to mad about this that's how you know you've made a big when when people are noticing um and are out there a counter protests sing and I think it's important to note too that there were only a couple of folks who are a counter protests thing and so again it's it tends to be that really allowed vocal minority of people\nWere getting troops to about the number of political candidates and the pride parade there were several uh Rob is in St Augustine Hi Rob\nGood morning you're going to look on the

it it's just their orientation you know a\n... or ... or ... or to move the look on the water but\nWhen we looked at first but to go vote revoke a first bothered me but I I understand that um\n\nMany

change in response to the ongoing deadly gun violence in the city is a goal for many in Jacksonville well activists on Jacksonville historic east side are working on this to\nThe first Daniel ... we rise festival is coming up this weekend on the east side it's focus is on the art and voices of young people\nNicole holder bomb and Nick Tom center with we rise jacks good morning to you both earning you know this is great because nobody surprised to hear that there is an ongoing concern about deadly gun violence in Jacksonville\nWe remain\nVery dubious leave Florida's murder capital and we've had a spate of gun violence over the last year and there are lots of people working on this\nThis is one way that people can lift up our young people so Nicole let's start with you tell me about we rise jacks and what's happening this weekend\nIn on the ...\nUm after the shooting at the landing I kind of something clicked inside my head and I was just like I Can't hear these stories anymore you know I just have to do something and have somewhat of a platform here that I've worked on building through my art and so I decided to do an event\n[noise] and um I Want it to focus on the youth because I Believe that in order to make a difference and make changes in our city you have to invest in the young younger generations and then we decided to do the event on the east side because it to the community that I Believe\nWe should invest in and there are you in that community that I Want to reach out to you\nAnd so we've organized over thirty local artist a lot of young artist over thirty performers a lot of young performers first time readers have poetry first time singers\nEt cetera a lot of cool vendors on the block skates apply is setting up a ... a street course I'm for skateboarding and the goal is to give the youth something to be a part of that is positive and creative also provide them with a support system and network positive role models\nAnd something that to show them that they can take different pathways in life that don't lead to violence and don't include violence\nMhm which is a a message that we need to send now Nick Tom send you live over on the east side or the local kids mural project is going to be part of this there will be live murals I guess painted during this whole event among other things\nAmong other things in the cold be the one doing them both my paintings you if you get a chance drive down a Phillip and see the mural that her in several a high schoolers did on the side of the brunt of the ... ... ... it's actually amazing\nRight ... yeah that's the thing where people need to come to these neighborhoods and see what's happening because\nEspecially but you said there's a lot going on on the east side no we we one of our schools could turn into a magnet school um but we got one of the smallest libraries in the city but it's one of the most active all libraries ... brings to Sean who's director of it\nI mean you can't even move there because of the kids that are and they're working on computers and doing her homework and things like this and an event like this is Nicole is doing is just going to help bring more of a youth together and understand that we do have some ability to do for\nSure um because you know whether kids live on the east side or any part of town or you want them to be part of this right\nYeah of course um we've this is very much a community event because I I'm a very busy person I have a lot of my play but I knew that it was important to do this so the goal was to bring together a group of people that was like minded and passionate about making a change so we've had\nUm we have our in our last meaning this tomorrow actually tomorrow night at seven PM at eastside Brotherhood which is open to all\nBut we've had five meetings so far with about fifty people at each meaning young artist community members et cetera that we've all been working together to make this event possible so it's very much a team effort\nAnd I think it's going to be a beautiful result\nYou have painted Merrill's by the way all over the city people can go to your website Nico swat they are like Rico Suave a Nico swab or they are dot com to see more of your work uh you've also done a lot of murals in title one schools\nAre around ... county so the kids mural project I'm really helps kids uh expand their portfolios so you're really taking your talent and trying to extend it to younger people in this way and your artist so public anyone can drive around and look at it which is really cool\nI Know I don't think it's important to have public art in our city and I think arts and culture is one of the most important things about a city so I think investing in the youth and young artist is a very important thing\nThe kid's meal project I'm isn't specifically targeting creative use its goal is to empower all youth so when we go to the schools which we've been to thirty schools here and do all county and painted nails with over three thousand kids\nThe goal is to empower them by allowing them to design the mural and putting their ideas on the wall and then I just facilitate it so the goal is to just show them that they're capable of things that they never even thought about before and just open their mind to the possibilities\nAnd then the concepts that we paint on the wall or quotes that they read every day and they see every day that remind them about the conversations that we've had and to remember what they're capable of\nThat it's such a great way to put it now neck tell me a little bit more about we rise jacks because this is the first annual festival that you're planning more\nWork or in the area right there's more happening\nUm I Would have to have you go talk about that more than anything because this was her baby I'm just really old guy in the\nRoom [laughter] I own my own guy in the room and it's like oh lord I Am so oh no no no\nFor ... for someone like me it's ... it's exhilarating to see the younger the younger generation stepping up and saying okay we need to do something for the one that's behind us\nBecause we've we've kind of lost that for a while and it's been really fun and really interesting to see a ball from the idea that she had to what's going to happen this Saturday\nSo I'm really open people will come out and have a lot of fun\nA trade or come on out to the first annual rewrites festival at nine Fifteen a Philippe ... boulevard this Saturday dozens of visual artists and performance artists they're going to

starts at eleven AM um and I guess anything else that people need to know is that\nWe need to be active in making a change in our city because Jacksonville has a lot of potential and I think if you
