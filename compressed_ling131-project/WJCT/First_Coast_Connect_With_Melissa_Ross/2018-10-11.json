the scruffy domestic violence awareness month I heard first call screeners [noise]\nDo you feel comfortable that that folks do ... you know specially those who are democratic residents who feel like this opportunity may have been hijacked for them that you feel comfortable that that answer or represent a satisfaction to um the representation of a district in other words\nIf you move to the district just to become a council member it right for you to do that\nIn in a not quite sure I've heard that a lot of questions from the residents of the district um but I Know the response they've heard for me is and when they asked what qualifies you or why it all starts with a love of God um I tell them and I shared my story my story was never really shared from the very beginning subtle a Baptist preacher\nSo my mother was a social worker for thirty plus years my brother started preaching at the age of twelve or dead or danger Fifteen and as a bishop in South Carolina serving is all I've ever known as a part of my DNA when I completed my professional baseball career and went back into a world of education I landed in Jacksonville in Nineteen Ninety nine\nCould have chosen many professions but I Want an education kids or the driving force for\nWhat brought me into this world of public policy so we're not sure what the ... people are hard to serve the relationships that I have with the with the business community relationship to have with the administration with the leadership I said who better\nServe represent a district in this short period because there's going to be an election in in large mhm who better represented district in someone that comes with these credentials\nOkay so we have a lot to get to hear from the city council my parents for him in a number of calls is five four nine to nine three seven if you'd like to get on the conversation and we're going to um get a caller in here a Stanley are you on the line\nOf family how you're are you there\n\nOkay we'll try him again Tammy how do you their family are you there okay we're having\nWe're having some trouble we lost family but we're trying to get him back um but so moving forward\nAnd the conversation do you know uh how many how many town hall meetings have you been holding and understand that you've been holding town hall meetings in the district and um you're you've been hearing from constituents that this is a good thing um how many have you had and is it something that's been there hasn't\nBeen done or more frequent have been done or what what are you hearing from your constituents\nSo to date I've I've had at least five town hall meetings um and then you know the district runs from the trout river all the way down to ...\nOr so the do my best to try to get to all parts of our district um but we've had if I I I understand that access is a challenge um in the district and so in the most recent town hall meeting I'm I've been bringing the city departments to the latest in a two district in and from public works J uh so\nYou name it I had them in the air so that any questions that residents of district in would have instead of coming to me in and meet coming back to downtown getting answers in going back out to them they were able to get those answers real time right there on the spot\nOkay so we're going to try again uh we have ... on the north side or leave you're on the line on first 'cause connecting morning\n\nSorry leading mourning\nMourning got family okay\nWe got you know very good\nGood morning I Want a government framing or one of the longstanding issues and that that's the subject problem we've had a mayor mayor\nAdministration up ministries she said that they were going to make it one of their goal to get rid of the uh if I got to\nKnow what you and the majority party to that project so that I'm a resident in that district I feel like a war\nAnd thank you for the question to me that's a very good question we've we've heard over and over again about neglecting district ten regarding to infrastructure so ... how are you going to you you just talked about your your relationship how are you going to use the relationship through to move somebody's project forward\nSo yes certainly that was one of the first things I'm a punk coming in that I did was to get an update of where we're at\n'em and set the tanks definitely at the top of the list of all many residents are in the district and so it became a top priority of mine and we know that that is a big issue to deal with\n'em to date where we're at built more\nAre we are that project is fully funded or it it is it actually scored the highest and it was out of the top three number one but I mean there's going to be a priority in ... where they have a timetable to\nThe timetable will just be like in the discussion of the budget and getting in and getting early and fighting are coming in when I did was such a limited time leading up to things\nUm it was definitely brought out that it was a of important to me\nBut are trying to identify those dollars and find them um because it's not a small number but that's one of the issues that they are structures that the public safety and infrastructure to the top priorities\nOkay so so are we we understand that you're working with the administration to make sure that just gives known as a priority\nMr okay I Would think we I think we got Stanley back now thank you very much thank you very much for that Stanley I think we have you this time\nAre you there yes than the good morning work in the first one's going to\nEat a good moment in Oh thank you but it's going to have a mom make us and a living with the free but if you ... even though someone\nA select you want you to represent a community of what I'm Talking about it for the government is going to say what about your ethics because as a as a Percival understanding that political system here my concern is that the Democratic\nArea for many years old an African American community over there and my concern here once again\nUh I like to tell me more about the ethics cause I Do not support you and when it comes to your ethics and the reason why they made that decision you made that decision to select a office that all\nRight thank you family for your call in terms of going to be a continued continuing uh you're between Democrats or Republicans you know why would a Republican represent 'em ... mostly democratic district how do you answer that you know how to you man for a missile Scott's concerns\nWell I ... in thank you for the question I represent two of my time surfing I'm prior to a disappointment um I was an assistant in city hall for city council member a and I answered the phone calls from residents I'm throughout our city\nAnd and what I share with residents additional ten is I don't ever recall getting a phone call someone saying that I have a democratic pothole\nOn the interstate that I Need you to come and fix I have a Republican treat us in the right away is blocking kids ability to walk to school and I need public worse to come and get it would they tell me as we have a problem and can you help us\nAnd so when I hear that I I I understand it I understand where it's coming from I respectfully disagree at times but at the end of the day Republican or Democrat shouldn't play a role in serving people is just start with a level of people love of God in heart the survey\nSo you believe that getting work done is going to mitigate we should mitigate the\nPartisan politics in it and representation for the district\nAnd Yes sir I say my focus will always be serving people and when they bring me issues I Would do my best to try to bring solutions\nOkay so we have another caller read you know it was on the line from Orange Park a red you know good morning and welcome to first girls connect\nMourners mourn hey\nI'll be great [noise] so your credit for early like what's making only about an election coming up so it it's going to change everything I Do believe that you don't want anything to bring about any change or the people there's so many people that go\nOh God oh God it was quite God and all that but you know the artist or climate All right you got a little coastal ... claimed that the man of God but yet you know what ... what\nAm I don't really know what do you want to just\nJump right yeah it's out there\nThank you for that raised you know the question is is that what are you reasonably leaves you can get done in a short period of time there wasn't been done before the and you've got a very short window in order to represent the district or should you decide to run for district in and that's another question we're going to ask you\nUm where where do you think you can get done or in a short period of time to show the people the district team that your your presentation your your properly represented in the district for their knees and not for any other political\nOr Yes sir and and what can be done well I'll tell you in in the next couple of days or will be another uh initiative rolling out here I'm told that would like to hold onto that just for a little bit longer amount of steel and some conversations with folks but\nAre going in and just leveraging relationships I'm meeting people and as I said earlier for for several weeks this district without any representation no one's saying at the table fighting for their needs when they're calling with their issues and concerns\nSo the first several weeks in my job was to catch up on all of those issues turned in a six to ...\nFind out where we're at in the process and try to bring those problems to a closure all while still showing up at and to the Johnson why diligence in everywhere I can do the senior centers\nAnd meeting people and introducing myself to him because I Know the question is I Know people don't know that I've been involved in working in the community for over the last twelve

been hearing more about domestic promising in ... women altogether for a little bit about or worse what's going on in our community and what we what we don't know about ... ...\nWell I can speak for Deval county and Hubbard house we see well over forty five hundred people a year that we provide services to and if you knew anything about Mr violence that doesn't account for all the people 'cause some people don't come forward and what we're learning is that when people don't come forward\nTo get help from Hubbard house or their local shelter that those are the people that are dying shelters provide life saving a life changing services and we want people to know that we're here to help as well as the other shelters\nAnd that's true for St Johns county as well for the ... center\nOn last year we saw 'em over thirty five hundred individuals that came to us for all the different services and so I kept our shelter continues to be over capacity um I Would say forty five percent at the time so you know people are calling it coming in\nAnd that we really need to get that information out to those that you know need further services for nano ... county\nThe norm and people lost their lives or as a result ... domestic bars from our intimate partner um the no ... or ... ... ... ... would be I mean ... picture for us here in our in our area\nWell developed county in two thousand Seventeen there were Fifteen domestic violence desk nine of them were due to an intimate partner violent\nSome of them were the partners or boyfriends girlfriends husbands wife but to ... other people to one was an adult daughter who is there to help her mother and when he killed his partner he killed the adult daughter as well and one was a three year old child who was shot and they had dead in front of his five year old brother\nSo domestic violence not only impacts intimate partner it impacts family members and impact other people in the area it's not just a crime that isolates itself totally to the home because we also see an overlap between domestic violence and people who are committing other mass shootings as well\nSo how do you all victims\nWell in St Johns county we have a full array of comprehensive holistic services so what we want to do is look at that survivor\nAnd really rat services around them to to give them safety but also support so you know we provide emergency shelter legal representation counseling you know other variety services that we offer to support that survivor and their children and you know have to remember that\nThe majority there's about half of our survivor population that come into shelter editors children so we're working with children on an individual basis and as a great that is well\nI Would agree with Joyce what she said they do in St Johns county we do at Harvard House as well and then another part that Joyce and I've been talking about for some time and she's actually been at the forefront of this is really pushing batter accountability if we\nHold batters accountable that's the people who are doing the crime so we can protect the victim which is good and give them options in services in support but until we get at the root of the problem and hold batters accountable when I mean we I mean everybody in the system the whole society than we are not stopping it where it starts and difficulties\nThat the whole ...\nActually in St Johns county we have a pilot project for which is the what first went in the nation and so what we do is we have a better accountability specialists that works within our child welfare system\nAnd what a Joe does is engage the batter and to making sure that see if he wants to work with his um case plan through department of children and families or if there's an injunction protection he makes sure where that\nAll up a task or followed as well that's required of him or her on the injunction for protection and if that's not being followed than what he does it he'll call 'em held to a to order to show called to the judges and then the judges brings them back in and either they will\nComply with their requirements or that we can be conscious\nJust for that so it's been a real successful program so far and we're really looking forward to continuing that perhaps maybe state wide\nSo how do you get the message to women system to better protect them because what we hear is that women don't report don't come for because they feel like they can't be protected remember better is going to\nGet out or get loose will get free is not going to be held held accountable to the point where they're making fuel phrase\nWell having shows like this and other venues where we can talk about the services out there is very very important and giving hotline number of the state wide hotline number one eight hundred five hundred one one one nine people can call that twenty four hours a day and get help there is somebody at the other end of that line who cannot let them look at what resources they have\nBut also just to let people know that there are so many ways that we can intervene not just Hubbard house or Betty Christian center but also the police the police here in Jacksonville are very good responding to domestic violence we have a very good relationship with them\nAnd the courts really do care about what happens with a survivor is just very scary for survivors to come forward\nBecause the batter as often told them if you come forward I'm going to kill you and that can be one of the most dangerous times for a victim children extended family is when they decide to get help indoor leave the relationship so calling a hotline first and thinking about a safe way to do it is so important\nHere I think is very important for people who want to know that information a number of you might want to give it one more time\nYeah it's one eight hundred five hundred one one one now and I also want to add to that\n[noise] excuse me collaborative partnerships with in your community is extremely important because you know ... can't do it alone Betty Christian center can't do it alone so we need to um work with our partners in our community\nBut also we need the community as a whole to be a part of the solution\nAnd at advocates we want to be the voices for those that are in fear of speaking out but also when the community comes together and supports survivor than other survivors are more comfortable coming out and speaking out against issue\nAll right thank you very much for being here this morning oh dear pat and would harbor house and Joyce mayor ... he represented thank you for being here\nThank you for having a heart you we'll be right back\nIt's the latest picture ... inches now who won an Oscar two years ago for directing the musical la la land film critic Justin Chang has this review\nFirst man might be one of the noisiest clunky is most you know we get movies about space travel ever made and I mean that in a good way the film adapted from James are Hansen's biography of Neil Armstrong returns us to a time when NASA technology was in its early stages\nWe first meet Armstrong played by Ryan Gosling as a test pilot in Nineteen sixty one flying a small fighter jet over Southern California at an altitude up around a hundred and forty thousand feet\nThe director Damien ... itself doesn't give us anything so beautiful wasn't exterior shot at the plane's going through the sky\nHe locks us inside the cockpit the engine noises deafening the images blurry and disorienting the tents close ups of Armstrong's eyes and the rattling motions of the aircraft remind you of the irrationality of human flight the sheer violence of defying the laws of physics\nYou learn a lot about Armstrong in the scene alone he doesn't say much and he's very very good at his job\nEven back on Tara from the camera has a lingering case the jitters there is a hand held roughness did the scenes of meal at home with his wife Janet played by an excellent clear for and their children\nTragedy strikes early on the Armstrong's lose their two year old daughter Karen to cancer Neal is devastated and throws himself into his work\nSeeking a fresh start he moved the family to Houston and enters NASA's Gemini astronaut training program\nAlthough gorgeously scored ... longtime composer Justin her with first ma'am looks and sounds nothing like their musicals whiplash and low end\nBut it has the same outsized ambition\nThe movie captures the flux of people in the sixties when NASA found itself caught between the pressures of the Cold War with the mandate to beat the Russians by any means and the resistance of a public unhappy with the program which cost millions of taxpayer dollars and several astronauts lives\nAgainst this tumultuous backdrop should sell and his screenwriter ... singer set themselves the tricky task of dramatizing the inner life of an American hero known for his lack of flash or pretension\nIn one scene Neal was interviewed by NASA panel and he responds to even a probing personal question in a stoic professional way I don't know what\nSpace exploration well uncovered but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration\nI think it'll be more of the fact that it\nAllows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nJust haven't been able to until now\nTo anyone ever anything else yeah\nYou know sorry to hear about your daughter\nI'm Sorry to hear a question\nWhat I what I mean uh do you think it will have an effect\nA reasonable to assume that it
