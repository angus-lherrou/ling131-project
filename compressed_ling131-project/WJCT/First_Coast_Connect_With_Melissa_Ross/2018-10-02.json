cafes in riverside Hi Cathy good\nMorning congratulations welcome to Jacksonville thank you thank you yes\nListening this morning about the budget for uh the city of Jacksonville and this is really weird because I thought to myself I work sporadically at ... ... a ... actually I was there a land eleven but ah oh wow\nWow what what do you remember about that day a witness I live on them\nVery yeah I remember sitting all the kids to the chapel\nInside [laughter]\nYeah I was thinking to myself I Would like to see more money\nPut around the area of Edward waters and I was curious as to thoughts on uh the area around ... waters and what plans have them up plans\nUm you would like to talk to the city about making changes and making upgrades and just this money put into that part of it I'm\nSure they rank you so much for that was going to she took the words right out of my mouth thanks Kathy\nGreat a great question um [noise] that is certainly something that's high on my priority list um our share with you I actually survey water is about ten years ago um was here for a very very short amount of time\nUm but I sat down with some some local leaders already and shared that\nTen years ago I came to the campus in in ten years later now I'm there haven't been there about eight weeks then as I look around that can you wrote court or not much has changed yeah um and so\nWe know that there needs to be very significant intentional investment in in in ... would water towers and the surrounding community here so goes it would waters in that community so goes the community\nI Will say that we are excited in in in very pleased with the support that our mayor and city council um has recently gifted the institution about nine million dollars to support a new stadium ... also serve as a health and wellness\nI'm kind of track facility for the citizens in the community there I'm In addition to that um the city as gifted the institution about four point five million dollars and made an investment\nIn one of our largest residents facility so that's a great start we're excited about that but there are certainly much much more work left to be done I can share Matt from recruitment standpoint and from our intention standpoint we need in a more of an investment from the business community and from the city\nI'm to be able to provide the kinds of services that again that talked about earlier millennial impulse million you'll students are looking for we need a drug store in that community when you grocery shopping in that community we live in a food desert there and write and many of\nThe citizens that are that are properly\nOn that in that north Jacksonville can you wrote court or are we out\nVery very essential services and so it's a real challenge for us our share with you when we open school back\nIn August I had students and parents that came to the institution silencing and and I\nI cringe to say this but it's just the truth became looked around the community got back in the car and left 'em because they say I I just I just don't feel comfortable I'm leaving my my son or daughter here and that's something that um it's a sobering\nWithhold them out of school altogether and they had planned declined\nTo campus to enroll their students um and then looked around the community there's again no grocery no no no no no real eateries it it just is not conducive\nFor the kinds of experiences that that that young folks and parents warmth for um their their sons or daughters and so we do all that we can at the college to be able to provide a safe or any conducive environment it's going to support their learning but we need more partnership\nFrom our business community and from other stakeholders around the city of Jacksonville to partner with us because we're educating our future um and so um if there wasn't an for an ... waters college you have to create one because that institution and in that community are critical to the Fort progression of the entire community\nYou know it's interesting that we're having this conversation with you today about the kings record or about northwest Jacksonville on October first twenty Eighteen which\n[noise] so I'll come back well this month October is garlicky chi awareness month in the state of Florida that Governor made that proclamation just the other day\nIt's a time to honor

film I'm telling you she quarter in the east coast green waist we did producer co produced a film in twenty twelve or we talked more about the culture ah we combined\nProduction with the Florida channel um and that product production was called the ... channel underground railroad\nSouth because the underground railroad originally came south to Spanish for before going north what I like to tell people were what I'd like to share with people there's two hundred and sixty eight years of missing Florida history from our history textbooks because we start\nPromoting or talking about the United states American Seventeen Seventy six but Florida was founded settled in Fifteen Thirteen and my family's home town was settled and Fifteen sixty five or four hundred and fifty years ago in five hundred years ago respect St Augustine exactly yeah I don't the go and teach the people are really\nI like to say the immigrants to the new world to settle some of the first four ths forums some of the first militias brought wheat to the new world brought a lot of vegetables to the new world and they were the slaves and their day because of the fact\nThat they were experts in agriculture and growing rice growing cotton growing so ... they were experts so\nThese stories have not relatively been poked and as you know because we can work and all this for the last Twenty years yeah it's still really highlights the cycling trails worth recycling trails rails to trails east coast grade ways and to see island loop with the most prominent being the east coast ...\nWow so they said the green way and the the ... the court or a really they track along the same line that place and if you go to the website ... court or dot org you can learn more about this we're talking about the coast in the islands in the Carolinas Georgia and Florida yeah and the green way cuts right through\nThat exactly it's pretty much what what we were able to do after\nWorking with the national Park Service and department of interior and having the national Park Service recognize and give us credence that\nThe underground railroad did ... did come south we walked up partnering with the ... the cultural heritage quarter to overlay the Park Service now we put on another overlay on top of that and the that is used to screen which the east coast screenplays extends from Key West for all all the way up to Bangor Maine\nAnd ... cheese cultural heritage quarter extends from ... county in North Carolina all the way down to St Johns County Florida and if you think of the storm at just devastated that whole\nArea from North Carolina and Georgia as the storm for its what better time to roll out a film on the go and he'd chew quarter or the east coast great ways\nThen today October first as you said the governor had issued de yah proclamation as he's done every six years naming October's going each month\nWow and the green way by the way it's the country's longest biking and walking rat it does go almost unbroken from Maine to Florida to Key West so when people watch this film what will they learn\nOh great question they were learn about for his neck natural eco tourism and they will learn

she should run that in more ahead this morning on first cats can act [noise]\nAfter the day's news [noise]\n[noise] I think there's a lot of reasons why that is they think it's going to be different for every woman a women lead in their communities already has so many different ways whether it's through the non profit work that they do or through business\nUh and it's really a helping women to to see that this is another place that it's worth their time and to bring them to bring their leadership skills to\nSo one of our program is our asks a woman to run program which has been a part of the should rent since we started and twenty eleven and thousands of women through that program has been nominated for run for office was has been a really important that like you might get encouraging women\nTo run it is one piece of the puzzle and I think a really important fact note is that when women run they win at the same rate as men so this is really about\nMore women to put themselves out there and lead and this way in their communities\nWill go to your calls in just a moment as we speak with she should run the number to join us five for nine to nine three seven now\nIn a moment we'll tell everyone about an incubator you're going to be having in Jacksonville to a train women that are thinking about running for office but let me ask you first Sophia with everything that's going on politically in this country right now\nHaving this engagement and this energy among women that are now throwing their hat in the ring\n[noise] so I Would say in in the past couple of years we definitely have seen a rise in interest in running for office from women from all different walks of life and across the political spectrum up politics has definitely been an area where\nAre we haven't seen historically as much participation from women but we have seen that change and women are coming to the political table with a different reasons and\nUh but really recognizing that our voices at the decision making table are really critical could we make up a over half of the population\nI recently wrote a book called broad influence uh that studied the impact women make if they achieve a critical mass of at least twenty percent in any leaderships here whether it's in the corporate world or in politics\nIf you can get at least twenty percent female representation it changes the decision making for the better it you you have a more well rounded view of society and you bring women's perspectives to the table it's really important and so\nThis is the is this is great that we're having you on today Sophia\nBecause there's a deadline coming up I Believe this Friday for women in yet area that want to be part of your incubator can you tell us all about that please\n[noise] definitely so one of the things that we've been doing that she should run is really a mess defying the process of how do you lay the groundwork for a run for office how do you get more involved in your community what are those uh\nUnique qualifications that you bring a that are valuable in your community and helping to build a community\nOf women that are supporting each other as they or running for office whether you're running next year or five years from now so our incubator as our flagship program that create back community and we have women all across the country that are benefiting from these programs and online and off line so we are bringing\nThat incubator program that we have\nTo back them felt Florida to your community or so that we can help on the ground\nA more women have access to these resources so at this uh November is one we will a launch our Jacksonville coke or of women who are interested in running for office\nI this is perfect for a woman who is thinking about running for office but doesn't know where to start that's really the starting place that we offer for women so it's okay if I as a woman who's interested doesn't know exactly what they want to run for doesn't know how they're going to get there that the work that we do is to help you get to that place\nAnd so the energy doesn't like the deadline friday night sorry go ahead yes no no

if you're thinking of running for office or if you just think more women should run for office five for nine to nine three seven you know\nA recent analysis by Reuters Sophia found that after November we could see an all time high of the number of women in our state legislators legislatures rather\nAbout forty percent if the\nThe majority of the women running when those contests so that's remarkable to because women have always been under represented in state legislatures that wouldn't get us to fifty percent but it would get us a lot closer than where we are now let me ask you as well with the cabinet hearing is playing out just so much intensity and\nClosely watched uh and so divisive\nThat the whole issue of abortion and roe versus Wade how how much do you see that as motivating women to run for office the cycle\n\nThink it's getting very for the woman that's running for office like I mentioned before you know we have women from all different backgrounds that are pursuing elected office and there are going to be different issues that drives them at\nSo that is definitely going to be one of them but that's not going to be the only issue that a woman is going to be stepping up to run in their community most of the women we work with\nAre thinking about running at at the local level on and found that the state level as well and so there are going to just a variety of reasons that women are stepping up to run but I think the universal\nTheme of why so many more women are running for office is women recognizing the value that they can bring that decision making table so whatever the issue comes before them that they are going to be able to bring a different perspective and hopefully produce better policy outcomes because of that\nWell again the the
