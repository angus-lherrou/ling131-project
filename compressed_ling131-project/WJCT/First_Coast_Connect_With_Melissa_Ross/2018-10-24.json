Jacksonville your community your world cloudy skies overnight lows in the mid ... some sun tomorrow hide in the upper seventies rain possibly thunder storms Thursday and friday\n[noise]\n\nFrom politics and public affairs to arts and entertainment first cars can act connects you to everything that's happening across the northeast Florida I'm militarized get plugged in as we interview the most compelling newsmakers of the first coast [noise] coming up this morning we speak\nWith Florida agriculture commissioner candidate Nikki Fried helping seniors at the beach engage at any age and also this week's lights on after school event that's all I had this morning on first can connect [noise]\nAfter the day's news [noise]\nPermit a there has been some controversy about mishandling of that what would you change in terms of the protocol for handling a weapons permits in the state of Florida and the issue of gun regulation and you know more broadly\n\nYeah I think it's ... if anything I Want to go in and actually do audit what exactly happened or we don't know uh we we have the bits and pieces of information that they could go in there and feel like we had an audit that we are not in this or any of the balls that were dropped and\nI Want to offer to start the conversation that actually didn't responsibility for law enforcement that way\nAll of them going in the way it is nearly they go really they'd be the background check on and we've also seen that this is the primary over three hundred emails released where the n._r._a. hacking the oversight and influence in the regulation of business you're weapon permit any gun licensing\nOpening moving over to law enforcement and they throw that it's done right you all the politics out of this that isn't that the theory is if you're in our state yeah we um have a unique opportunity to to make a difference and to make sure that the lives of our citizens are not a breath because of politics isn't a partisan issue\nI this is something that every single citizen and are they just want to have happen it's just complete background check all those individuals who are going to get hunting licenses of those who are going to get your weapons permitting ah and I think that this is a call for action that must happen to protect the citizens of our state\nNow you say it's not a partisan issue but uh when it comes to the second amendment guns people do fall along sharply partisan lines you're a Democrat and a you're campaigning on a policy of tighter gun regulation\nWhat's your strategy to reach out to voters who this is the issue that they are the most about they there are more conservative voters\nThey voted in every election specifically because they care so much about gun rights and uh the rights that are inherent in the second amendment and they resist any attempt to change what they see is an infringement on those rights\nAnd and we're not and I'm not proposing that at all what I'm saying is that we need to be doing our jobs are doing background check is not a partisan issue or you talk to any of the conservative out there that\nAre are listening and they're going to agree that didn't make sure that the right people are having the guns in the wrong people don't and that's and background checks\nAnd so that's not partisan and when I tell everybody that I'm not I'm I I\nMyself have a concealed weapons permit I own a gun for self defence purposes so I Am not looking to infringe I'm at an attorney uh so I you know balance this support the second amendment a solemn doing is saying that we need to deal with that or check\nOur government makes sure that we're protecting our citizens and that's doing thorough background checks\nAnd that means moving it over to law enforcement uh\nTo do this to make sure that we're doing it properly or then that that's a rational that at the rational basis just to do so I'm not infringing upon anybody's right if you um should be qualified you had a concealed weapons permits or a hunting license then you're going to get one a clear and simple as that\nIf you're just tuning in we're speaking with Nikki freed the Democrat running to replace out of putting them as the state's agriculture commissioner what are your questions for her give us a call at five for nine to nine three seven now uh you've been on this program before Nikki talking about the fact that not only would you be see overseeing agriculture but also\nConsumer services in the state of Florida\nIt's a huge agency and it overseas so many aspects of life\nIn the sunshine state one of the issues that has gotten a lot of attention and criticism is the states do not call solicitation list\nA you know people have joked that whichever candidate is perceived as being able to stop the unwanted phone calls might be the winner [laughter] or whether it's you or your opponent Mac Caldwell this is a big issue for Floridians who\nFeel like they're being harassed even scammed by a lot of these calls\nHow would you change the way the consumer wing of this agency handles do not call list\nWe we all probably have a thirty or forty numbers last on our phone and I feel horrible for those who are getting these phone calls is all of us\nAnd it's that kind of our seniors and those who are on a minute by minute plans that both horizon is absolutely and what I Would do is first of all you know I as a practicing attorney app attacking consumers and taxpayers but most of my legal career or this comes as part of what I've been doing for for my career\nAs a part of it and make sure that we are responsive\nYeah right now I've been hearing stories all across the state that when\nSomebody calls and you the commissioner's office to report a number or there's no one on the other line they leave messages and the gal getting any return phone calls the one that the beep off the bat\nOr to be looking into investigating nice to actually have somebody on the other line to be taking down these and it's beefing up our security and our technology ah you know we know that you know there's people out there that are brought into our consumers\nUm are are smart we need to be smarter we need to make sure that we have some of the best technology and that we're going in and actually making a difference and then prosecuting these individuals and these companies um once we get a name\nAnd we'll start prosecuting them and holding them accountable or there will be a ripple effect the author said\nOkay let's go to a few close now for Nikki Fried is five four nine to nine three seven Patrice on the north side high Patrice morning\n[laughter] good morning one of those so so great to talk to you again it's been a while um have you on the show\nYes um I wanted to ask 'em as a fried um how would she work in conjunction with a Andrew Gillum and Senator Bill Nelson and also make her goals for the state of Florida a bear fruit\nYeah thanks for that uh you know Nikki Fried or if you were victorious certainly your campaign platform will have greater chance of success if your fellow Democrats win those races particularly yeah Tallahassee mare Andrew Gillum if he's elected governor\nRather than if you'd be working with a a governor Ron dissent is the Republican so what about that\nYeah you know I somebody from my entire life or my dad Republican my uh my mom is Democrat um I Would hold and part of the very early age are affected policy come through and you know come into the center on issues\nAnd that's what I've done you know when I spent my time in Tallahassee and passes and great legislation for foster care kids in public education and we had to cross party lines and work together for good policy\nAnd so that would do that regardless of who is doing there or von ... work together it's love with the policy and I have a track record of doing so I have friends on both sides of the aisle a incoming speaker and Senate president often individuals that I've worked a\nAlongside with over the years for for policy purposes and and that wouldn't change I'm I'm somebody who has an open door policy likes to bring people to the table\nAnd work through issues and I I'm somebody who doesn't like the play partisan politics I'm somebody who likes to get things done\n[noise] it it would be remarkable if say a we had a democratic governor with some Republican cabinet members or the or vice versa see you when your race and you're working\nWith the Republican governor\nUm that could present some interesting challenges are on some of these issues given that the Republican I'm Mr\n... farm or conservative on all of these issues than you or any of the other Democrats running for these these statewide offices is or is there a common ground to be found at the parties are so far apart\nOn all of these issues\nThat there's always common ground you know I I I Believe I firmly believe that everybody if they're coming in on the left of the positions to do what's best for the state of Florida and we may differ on what that looks like but if your heart is in the right place\nOh we're going to find compromise on and you know and maybe a little bit longer than you know if it I had my fellow Democrats on like that but I can guarantee you that there's going to be compromised the hot because if you want what's best for the state of Florida and stagnation or is it what's with that\nAnd so we're going to work through these issues and the way I have no doubt that regardless of who's in the cabinet we're going to be able to work together\n... on the north side Sean hello good morning\nMorning\nUh uh I have a question from his Nikki a and please let me know if that falls on your own room or score scope of my concern on the north of Jacksonville uh is urban for urban farming\nAnd then another concern of mine is that we are a port city here in Jacksonville\nAnd I was concerned about commodities and export or to be over to generate some top gainful employment for or the citizens in the north quarter of Jacksonville and a few the so under your scope or if you were lucky\nThings for both the ongoing question thank you\nSorry I the first part is absolutely that the um urban farming ... was actually falling\nHe sold the fight on Mr Guillen fact it very much I have a question for Mr who sent us now who said passed new gun control measures after the massacre of Seventeen people not far from here at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland\nYou're on record that you would have vetoed the bill why reject raising the age of Twenty one to buy any firearm and the state of Florida why refused require a three day waiting period by rifle and why not banned the sale bump stocks which allow rifle to mimic a machine gun\nMy wife's case and I have two young kids and so safety particularly in schools is a top priority for me I Want our kids to be safe and so I'm going to work with people like Andy pilot who lost his daughter meadow park when and we're going to fix the problem with school security you can take that to the bank\nUm I think the way to keep our community safe is obviously you've got to work with law enforcement not against law enforcement\nAnd you need to identify those individuals who should not have access to firearms to blanket ban on the restriction that's kind of get struck down in the courts constitutionally enumerated rights you always got to do it I'm In a way that's precise and so that is what I Will do focus on these people make sure that they're off the streets and the problem that I saw with park one\nWas a failure at multiple levels of government at the local level at the federal level with the FBI and yet here we stand\nNobody has been held accountable yet when I'm governor we're going to bring accountability and and I'm going to make sure that folks are held accountable when they dropped the ball\nWas sort of satisfaction Gillum you're signed into\nWhat I Would have done is pushed for stronger bill uh ethnicity scientists should acknowledge he's endorsed by the n._r._a. or another or a\nEntity of which he is wholly accountable and owned by\nWhen I took on the n._r._a. of they sued me and drove me through court for two years all because we had a city ordinance which said you could not shoot guns in city parks\nWhen we win this race it'll be simple it's not a threat to the second amendment\nIf you want to own the power of God at your waist vote you ought to have a background check if you want to have you on domestic violence of user convicted you shouldn't have a gun that you can sniff out the lives of your loved ones when our parents drop our kids off at school we should have an expectation that we'll be able to pick them up a lot less time Mr Saturday\nActually Andrew is he's the most hostile candidate\nTo the second Amendment rights of all biting citizens during the primary he said he would ban he had a criteria of what he would ban it would ban virtually all hand guns that are sold or in in the state of Florida and said we'd get them off the streets which to me he says he's going to do he's going to gauge and confiscation so\nHe can he will not protect your rights I'll stand with law abiding citizens but public safety is going to be number one we're going to work with law enforcement\nTo make sure community safe I don't want to see cities like Tallahassee have record number of murders Mr Jones\nListen I'll propose it was very simple it is if you want to shoot off a gun that can fire sixty bullets in sixty seconds you ought to join the military backed turning our street and our communities are neighborhoods and in our schools into war zones is unacceptable it is no coincidence\nThat pulse nightclub what happened here no coincidence that what happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the everyday gun violence that pervades far too many communities all across the state of Florida we've got to check the n._r._a. they will not run roughshod over the state of Florida and they were a comment and decent a solutions that we can employ to make that happen without", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Coast Connect
