entertainment first coast connect connects you to everything that's happening across the northeast Florida I'm Melissa Raasch get plugged in as we interview the most compelling newsmakers of the first coast\nComing up this morning confused about those twelve ballot amendments that you'll be asked to decide this election will have a closer look at what they all mean then later the Georgia barley water prize how it's being used to address Florida's algae crisis fat and more I had this hour on first cars can act [noise]\nAfter the day's news\nWhich is really the the larger issue with all of these men ... yeah I I see all of these amendments is just the abject failure of the legislature to legislate they say it's all of this has to be done through voter amendment\nThis is you know are we Florida's on six constitution the last one we adopt it was in Nineteen sixty eight and since then we have amended the constitutional hundred and twenty nine times so it's a hundred and twenty nine times either through citizen initiative\nThe constitution revision commission or the legislature 'cause they also can put out um it's on the ballot of course a hundred and twenty nine times we found this action dissatisfaction with the actual ability of our legislature to pass things that we as the as the voting public decide we do want to to chase constitution\nOkay or we'll go to your calls in a moment about all of these ballot amendment there twelve than ever to join us five for nine to nine three seven now amendment to is also a property tax assessment amendment it would place it ten percent cap on the increase of non homestead property tax assessment\nA Daniel this will has a chance of passage to since voters will read it as I'll be paying less taxes\nCorrect and this is going more going to to be impacting obviously the commercial property owner or the property owner with rental properties\nAlong to the opposition on this too from the rental property perspective isn't in reality the market market or in in ... rental properties are going to be I mean it's a competitive marketplace a so again this may be a a benefit to commercial property owners who are not going to be saying their taxes go up greater than ten percent\nBut to the average Floridian or this is this is going to be you know non consequential legislation except again impact or impacting revenue coming into the state coffers in order to do things with that money\nOkay let's talk about amendments three this would give voters to power to decide whether a new casino could open in the state of Florida rather than a leaving it to the legislature to manage it so the dog tracks horse tracks that want to expand their gaming it would make it more difficult for them to do so I'm a people\nAre that are involved in a pair of mutual betting world had been lobbying heavily about amendments\nThree right I in my case in my particular opinion on this one relative to how it impacts the the folks in our area um is that the way that the amendment is proposed to the Florida public it would give the public the ability to approve casino gambling new casino gambling on a state wide but\nThe counter to that is it's let's say for example that are in a situation to do all county where to change them let's say we wanted to take the south bank you're downtown and build a casino\nPut Harris casino that is correct and we approve of casino and ... by local referendum the next step for us to have the legislature prove that if you were to vote for him at three every ... to get in the state would\nVote on genetic ...\nUm you know if you're talking about local control of issues or if you're talking about the diversity of our state with putting almost Twenty one million people now a totally different political cultures and social cultures to throughout our state you're basically asking folks who live in the panhandle to decide the future of gambling in Miami\nRight here for a local control of these issues you're probably in now on three ... got his my take on okay and then for widely\nPopular this is the one that has gotten a lot of attention this cycle it would restore voting rights to former felons who have served their sentence this has widespread support bipartisan support\nYeah it does um you know libertarian groups such as ones that are funded even by the conservative Koch brothers have come out in favor of this um I think all the amendments when we talk about things which are down ballot of the top races which could actually bring voters out this is one of the issues that you'll run into folks who are basically like you know vote yes on amendment for we need to pass this\nYou know having one point five million a Floridians ah who don't have suffrage who basically um if you've seen any of the news on this you know who have to wait five to seven years\nAnd then just have arbitrary decisions made about whether or not they can get their voting rights restored I mean if we really have a department at the point being if we really have a department of corrections and we're asking folks to rehabilitate sort of their time and get out\nThey need to have in order to be fully integrated back into our society they deserve the right to vote were the worst state in the country by many by many groups who evaluate a voting rights were considered the worst date\nSo this is a popular again and I think that you're there is overwhelming support for it you are correct\nAnd as we continue talking about the ballot amendments we've only gone through a few of them yeah oh my gosh this is like a good a class and and the\nFence if I have to make some sort of defense of the constitution revision commission the point with their ... to the one of their argument is is that right now we have twelve on the ballot if they were to have separated all these like twenty or thirty yeah and it would become like a California style ballot if you've ever heard of I Know California forty five minutes to vote on\nThere and you could have also made the argument that they didn't need to not all of these needed to make it to the\nBallot that well that is also true by now these all of these things are things that the legislature could have done without amending the constitution that could have they could have a yeah you'll pass laws sand\nAnd we're going to keep talking about them or let's take a few calls though at five for nine to nine three seven picked her in San Marco Hi Victor good morning go ahead\n[noise] hey good morning and it cuts down when I was about um how many were left kind of on the editing or on it or leave it open primary or something on the ballot\nAnd that's a good question um thank you for that I think that did come up during the constitution rotation commission process they did not allow that idea through\nYet because the tea or your questions to St Louis neither political party and they want at once open primaries they want closed primaries\nA for a variety of reasons not the least of which is that they don't want to have people crossing over to vote for candidates that they may feel are popular that did not match up with their ideology or so so I'm not surprised at all because I understand the CRC well as a citizen appointed commission a these are still thirty seven people who are political uh they're they're\nLargely appointees of the governor governor and party that's correct yeah bicker uh\nAnd um [noise] the ah yeah yeah the legislature\nYeah so you have to look at these amendments through that prism these were amendments that that particular group of people decided gee I'd go on that\nLand there there are a lot of good things that could come out of these amendments but outside of the ones that you will see a but they're all political mean they're all political they're all they're all there was some sort of political steak and all these for a variety of groups are what are the causes that are good or what are the causes are um nefarious depending upon your opinion uh they're definitely all political\nFive for nine to nine three seven mark and Mandarin hello mark go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm Evan or if I Want to serve this time and the guy is right\nTo vote of course is restored and we know many many of them will never re offend than many well\nOr as he gets his right to vote restored he's arrested for say armed robbery and months later I tried and convicted and appeals\nUpheld and those are the pale pale is made for to the Supreme Court in Mali and they decide not to take the case and I feel fans at what point does St Louis has right to vote when all else have been exhausted\nWhat you're saying if a minute for passes what the future scenario like that appear to be okay thanks for that question I I honestly don't know the answer to that when I Do know is that amendment for\nWould automatically restore rights for those who served their time with the exception of those convicted of murder or sexual offense and yet\nDoesn't protect anybody from re arrest yeah I'm a ... if you'd rearrested if you're a felon and you sort of your time and you were committed another felony or a robbery in this case was the caller suggests a ... year still gonna lose your right to vote again if you go through the legal system\nAs to whether or not like as your taste goes through appeal I mean while you're incarcerated while you're waiting for your appeal if you are in prison you're not going to be able to vote while you're waiting for that state to work its way through the court system\nI'm\nOkay and and as you pointed out Daniel Florida is one of only four states that currently disenfranchise as a former felon for life or permanently are they there is a process to get your rights restored in Florida but it's very difficult you have to pursue it that is correct you had to go after it and it's very hard to get the clemency\nThat's correct correct OK Now\nLet's go through some of these other ones will try to go through as the bundled ones quickly a lemon five would require a two thirds vote in the Florida House and Senate images super majority vote instead of a simple majority to raise taxes\nThe legislature wanted this on the ballot they want to make it more difficult to raise taxes they want to make it tougher for themselves to raise taxes are so this doesn't apply to local revenue but state wide taxation\nRight if you come from the philosophy that I'm a lean government is the best kind of government this uh the supports that notion and ... it's more than probably going to pass polling indicates because again the way it's worded it's us paying less taxes for for the state to operate\nHowever uh you know to to basically put a and make it more difficult to pass a tax increase who knows and the future what we as libertarians will tell our legislature that we wish to have funded and now it would be a greater threshold for us to order to get that passed\nOkay the next series of amendments six seven eight nine ten and eleven\nAre all what with which we called bundled amendments correct there's a bunch of measures bundled into one\nThis is where voters if they even make it this far into the ballot or going to be looking at this if they especially if they they're confronting it for the first time in going what what am I voting for here what is that well let's\nLet's talk about the one which probably most people talk about is the most fun to talk about if you want to find humor is a mammoth nine ah which would combine your if you choose it's offshore oil drilling\nAnd invade and face [laughter]\nAt what the what the CRC the constitution revision commission said as they they referred to this as a clean air clean water clean air in terms of trying to make these two completely different issues uh\nWhat a nice picture you paint\nThat Daniel ... I Know but\nIt you know and this is ... regardless of the political party that's in power to the to be quite candid whenever you get a dominated stacked state legislature with the governor for Twenty years you were going to get aid ideology which creeps in onto that political culture whether it's liberal or words conservative wherever you're at\n'em and that's when you can see sometimes they will be ground and they won't be reflective to changes within the states' attitude I mean just think about over in the last Twenty years think about where attitudes towards marijuana have gone\nRight and that the voters were far ahead of the legislature on that one that is yeah uh and and and and and you you've seen that in a number of states both red and blue states on different issues Leah in our TV hills hello Leah good morning to you\nAnd learning um I my comment about all the amendment that got I got in the west bank caught part at our vote have America dot com and they've actually broken down all of the amendment our every\nDay in debt like eat any language in it out of the like why your jargon and I got ... ...\nYeah okay I wanted to bring that I wanted to like that with everybody like even got to have a cat and a bipartisan\nWhen I Do not um you know for any type of fat or anything like that but it doesn't break it down really in plain English everything amendment that you're going to vote on and then my other um what's actually bring a cheat sheet Whitney when you've out a way\nThat's a great idea ... we have that is\nBipartisan what does that anymore but listen I appreciate that suggestion because I think that that's one of the things that the ... um you know in all fifty states voters can be intimidated by what they see as jargon as things that that that we wouldn't on a daily basis be able to understand just in our plane conversations\nSo thank you for that resource that's helping them actually their share with my students to so thank excellent\nAnd then before we go back to some more calls let's talk about the final two amendments twelve and Thirteen\nAmendment twelve would expand ethics rules for public officials basically it would prevent someone leaving a state governments to\nLive remediate Lee turned around and lobby that same government ... try to prohibit the revolving door right between government service and cashing in as a lobbyist or at least slow it down and then amendments search team which is generated a lot of discussion in and\nEyeballs is the one to end greyhound racing in Florida by twenty twenty\nRight right uh amendment twelve widely supported by most good government groups right a feeling that this is a wonderful ... amendments Thirteen talked about obviously I mean we have a greyhound racing here in our viewing area um you know and this is really coming there are Seventeen\nDog tracks in the country left eleven or in Florida\nI live in a more and Florida and I think all of them are pretty much that are left are in the south or so so this I mean you've had groups you know the Florida greyhound association\nI'm you know the Florida chamber of commerce of course have oppose this amendment ah but the wide almost every animal welfare organization across the country including the league of women voters have said that it's time to end dog racing it's it's something it's archaic it's part of our past um and it's time to move on\nJay on the Southside high Jay morning things for holding go ahead\nYeah I was calling to comment on the I guess the amendment that were on the ballot hours early voter and I'm\nI'm a transplant I've been here a few years or so and we just moved to this is my first time voting in the county and for a a A R well\nBasically\nAnd this is the first time I've ever seen amendment piggyback on top of amendments\nLike that yeah and the comment I had was to transplant I'd never seen that so it wasn't so much confusing more or less it was like why would you put a state\nOf an amendment for vaping indoors and outdoors with offshore drilling like you were saying earlier\nIt's more than it doesn't make sense it's like you're making some people may may you're looking at one issue and making the other one petty try and a couple of them together and it felt like that on a blizzard in court and as far as that is almost looking like a legislator has no comments that\n[laughter] but it may not\nAvail Iraq and put it nicely I mean you have no common sense whatsoever to other legislators do they're smart enough\nTo have a bad name is Jay yeah thanks for all those inside\nMak first of all thanks for voting thanks for getting out there and doing that especially being new to the area a it's great and second of all you're not the only one scratching your head I mean it's it's there were a lot of things that were bundled together a debt when you look at it for the first time whether you're somebody who's in a vet\nSo you're a someone who is Eighteen perhaps voting for the first time and you're looking at your ballot saying you know what is this have added we get at this point\nLet's take one more call on the ballot amendment early voting is underway now maybe you've already voted on them but if you have questions let's get a few more answered Steve is in San Marco Hi Steve good morning\nGood morning how are you okay thanks\nThanks for taking the call I just wanted to say a huge thanks for both the program and and the gift today um but with all of the side uh conversations before you sign off today if you could just summarize\nThe the bike thumbs up thumbs down on all of these um I did not I have not early voted him park because I'm a I heard another caller said she'd taken three or four hours to try to go to if you're a all these amendments um so if you could summarize these before you sign off that would be huge\nOkay thanks um now do you want to\nYour students have their professor ... how they should vote on all of these amendments ...\nI I Will tell you I Will share this in this again this is only personal I did not support ... an image six through eleven I did not support any of the bundled amendments myself because I moving forward I wanted to send a clear message Twenty years from now to the next constitution revision commission\nThat Floridians deserve to make decisions on an individual basis up or down on these issues and not having to jam together again Eddie ... I mean that can isn't necessarily the case you don't have to follow that you may be a huge adversary of offshore oil really and you go ahead and you say yeah I Am going to support him in ... and you should um\nI personally uh again as a political Tony's as somebody who had a career in local government don't like restricting the amount of revenue that we can raise if times require us to raise revenue or shifting the burden as the caller suggested earlier which ones\nAre you supporting and let me just point out to that caller or the league of women voters of Florida has a really good voter guide on all of these amendments they're non partisan a good governance organization the amendments they support the only ones they support our three\nFor nine and Thirteen I\nYou know the caller asked me I voted I supported him in the foreign I supported amendment Thirteen and those are the only ones who voted yet I remember Thirteen is actually very difficult for me because I used to really enjoy going to do in ... oh it's a it's a I think it's just I you know it's fun it's just something you can do but at the end of the day I mean it just\nIt wait on me you know my enjoyment of somebody to be going out a versus a lot of things and a lot of the press and a lot of doping these animals which has come out in recent years at these dog tracks\nAh for me I was willing to basically give up something which I deem is entertainment to think about the care in in in the health of the dogs um so but listen every I've just say everybody needs to go out you know do ... this was helpful today but go out and do your own personal research\nAnd you don't vote your conscience a and and that you'll you'll never be wrong when you go to the polls Melissa if you just build your contract and you're going well researched\nAnd keep in mind to all of these amendments have a pretty high bar sixty percent of the little voter approval required to pass into law a again a these are complex so to brush up before you go to the ballot or to the ballot box and thank you Daniel Kohn wrath\nOf assets CJ always great insights always a pleasure to be here\nMuch more still ahead meanwhile later sparking innovation in Jacksonville will tell you about this week's Ted acts salon but up next in our going green how the Everglades foundation is using prize money to clean up Florida's algae ... we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise]\n", "show_name": "First Coast Connect With Melissa Ross", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "01"}
