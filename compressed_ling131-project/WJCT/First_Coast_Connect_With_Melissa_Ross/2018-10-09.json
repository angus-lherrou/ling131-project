Community Survey um backs this up so something that was really fascinating was that\nTwenty seven percent of members of the algae Beatty community reported being a member of the house of worship but when you when you break that up and you look at African American algae Beatty respondents the numbers over fifty percent\nAnd so I'm an African American and black individuals are facing discrimination but they're also way more involved in their faith community and so this is really relevant in these different communities can come together to address some of the concerns in Jacksonville okay uh\nIn Jacksonville is unfortunately the place where there has been a rash of murders of transgender women of color\nSo this can be deadly or as well as um an issue in someone's church or family or face a place of work are you going to talk about uh that aspect of this\nAnd even I'm sure that will come up a you know I think some some people might be surprised that would be encouraged to know that are in a in the response to some of those murders that there were a leader these leaders are algae B.

Jacksonville Hi Barbie good morning\nOr good morning thank you for taking my call sure\nI just wanted to make a comment I'm a graduate of you and if you talk at the J for many years I'm Seventy three a big gay all of my life\nAnd I have seen a lot of discrimination and the LBJ a community and I I just do not understand help people\nUp any tight stitch they believe in God and Jesus Christ shoulder to show for it\nCan turn their nose to anyone\nYou know that's like comet I don't understand how they think that they can judge other people\nThinks Barbie thanks for sharing your your perspective on that okay you know we live in a world now where marriage equality is a lot of the land and abroad majority of American people are just fine with that\nI'm On the other hand there's still a lot of discrimination out there as we heard from her\nYeah absolutely I think\nYou know the the struggle with the the marriage equality I'm rolling as that we still have all these day to day issues of um of feelings of of being scared or not understanding different communities\nAnd I like to always focus on the movable metal so when we're talking about persuasion and there's always going to be those outspoken folks who um use either data or scripture to communicate with their messages as opposed to what ever um that larger meaning might be\nUm very much like what are our caller and um talked about and so when we can focus on spreading um knowledge and connecting with that move on metal I think that's how we'll continue to to make progress on these issues of racism and homophobia and Matt ... may have more say about that from the religious perspective\nYeah I think you enough we want students to know is that a Elgin beauty cue and safe\nI don't have to be an oppositional relationship in fact\nElder be teaching people are people face and we have students are on campus who are trying to make that connection we had an event last Thursday\nOr where we were talking about coming out in the context of religion and we had students who are saying I'm trying to figure out who I Am because I have this identity but also on religious\nAnd how to reconcile that we had on the show recently this kid named Seth Owen who's become well known because he graduated as his valedictorian from pecan become park high school no um [noise] he lives up in that area a school up in the north side\nAnd he's gay and his parents essentially basically kicked him out because he would not go to the church of their choice and he said\nTo them I I Want to go to a church just not this one because it's so a hostile to who I Am and\nSo basically he ended up couch surfing and through a go fund me account want to a lot of money to go to Georgetown University he was on the Ellen show just a week or two ago\nSo I think of him as an example of what you're talking about it as a young man who is a a person who wants to have a spiritual practice but wants to find a faith community that's accepting of him and that can be difficult for a lot of young people who aren't raised in an accepting face environment that\nIt can be difficult and I we do we get a lot of phone calls from community members who are either young people themselves or parents are seeking algae Beatty affirming\nOr churches synagogues mosques et cetera um and because they're looking for guidance and to be able to find someone to replace that not\nNot just a neutron up and is able to affirm who they are and let them be who they are authentically are in their community is so important\nUm I think sometimes parents feel that they're doing the best for their kids when they enforce these very strict rules are guidelines or force them into um churches who aren't as affirming and the best thing that we can do it's accept our young people for who they are to support them and that um even if we don't agree with that\nI think we have a a minister on the line who has some thoughts about this is Ken and riverside Hi Ken good morning\nGo ahead I'm calling because there is or in the rubber thought communicates on preaching\nNow a flower wherever SawStop this church in our in the car he just hated um Saturday on the great

over the weekend but a such a sea\nChange from how from people in fact that I Know that have been involved with that for many years it's just a completely different situation from how it used to be\nAbsolutely and I was talking to mad about this that's how you know you've made a big when when people are noticing um and are out there a counter protests thing and I think it's important to note too that there were only a couple of folks who are a counter protests thing and so again it's it tends to be that really allowed vocal minority of people\nWere getting treats too about the number of

to\nThe first Daniel ... we rise festival is coming up this weekend on the east side it's focus is on the art and voices of young people\nNicole holder bomb and Nick Tom center with we ride jacks good morning to you both earning you know this was great because nobody surprised to hear that there is an ongoing concern about deadly gun violence in Jacksonville\nWe remain\nVery dubious leave Florida's murder capital and we've had a spate of gun violence over the last year and there are lots of people working on this\nThis is one way that people can lift up our young people so Nicole let's start with you tell me about we rise jacks and what's happening this weekend\nIn on the ... um after the shooting at the landing I kind of something clicked inside my head and I was just like I Can't hear these stories anymore you know I just have to do something and I have somewhat of a platform here that I've worked on building\nThrough my art and so I decided to do an event\n[noise] and um I Want us to focus on the use because I Believe that in order to make a difference and make changes in our city you have to invest in the young younger generations and then\nWe decided to do the event on the east side because it's a community that\nI Believe we should invest in\nAnd they're used in that community that I Want to reach out to and so we've organized over thirty local artist a lot of young artist over thirty performers a lot of young performers first time readers have poetry first time singers\nEt cetera a lot of cool vendors on the block skates apply is setting up a ... a street course I'm for skateboarding and the goal is to give the youth something to be a part of that is positive and creative also provide them with a support system and network\nPositive role models\nAnd something that\nTo show them that they can take different pathways in life that don't lead to violence and don't include violence\nMhm which is a a message that we need to send now Nick Tom send you live over on the east side or the local kids mural project is going to be part of this there will be by murals guess painted during this whole event among other things\nAmong other things in the cold be the one doing um blood paintings you if you get a chance Dr don't fill up and see the marrow that her in several high schoolers did on the side of the brunt of the building of accidental Sunday it's actually amazing\nRight ... yeah that's the thing where people need to come to these neighborhoods and see what's happening because\nEspecially but you said there's a lot going on on the east side no we we one of our schools could turn into a magnet school um but we have one of the smallest libraries in the city but it's one of the most active all libraries ... brings to Sean who's director of it\nI mean the afternoon you can't even moving there because of the kids that are and they're working on computers and doing her homework and things like this in an event like this with Nicole is doing is just going to help bring more but you've got to understand that we do have some ability to do something\nSure um because you know whether kids live on the east side or any part of town or you want them to be part of this right\nYeah of course I'm we this is very much a community event because I I'm a very busy person I have a lot of my play but I knew that it was important to do this so the goal was to bring together a group of people that was like minded and passionate about making a change so we've had\nUm we have our in our last meaning this tomorrow actually tomorrow night at seven PM at eastside Brotherhood which is open to all\nThat we've had five meetings so far with about fifty people at each meaning young artists community members et cetera that we've all been working together to make this event possible so it's very much a team effort and I think it's going to be a beautiful result\nYou have painted Merrill's by the way all over the city people can go to your website Nico swat they are like Rico Suave a knee goes while they are dot com to see more of your work or you've also done a lot of murals and title one schools\nAround Juba County so the kids mural project I'm really helps kids or expand their portfolios so you're really taking your talent and trying to extend it to younger people in this way and your artist so public anyone can drive around and look at it which is really cool\nYeah I Know I think it's important to have public art in our city and I think arts and culture is one of the most important things about a city so I think investing in the youth and young artist is a very important thing\nThe kids Merrill project I'm isn't specifically targeting creative use\nIts goal is to empower all youth so when we go to these schools which we've been to thirty schools here and do all county in pain in Merrill's with over three thousand kids\nThe goal is to empower them by allowing them to design the mural and putting their ideas on the wall and then I just facilitate it so the goal is to just show them that they're capable of things that they never even thought about before and just open their mind to the possibilities\nAnd then the concepts that we paint on the wall or quotes that\nThey read every day and they see every day that remind them about the conversations that we've had and to remember\nWhat they're capable of that is such a great way to put it now neck tell me a little bit more about we rise checks because this was uh\nFirst annual festival that you're planning more\nWork or in the area right there's more happening um\nI Would have to have to go talk about that more than anything because this was her baby I'm just the old guy in the room\n[laughter] I I'm an old guy in the room and it's like oh lord I Am so oh no no no ...\nFor someone like me it's ... it's exhilarating to see the younger the younger generation stepping up and saying okay we need to do something for the one that's behind us because we've we've kind of lost that for a while\nAnd it's been really fun and really interesting to see a ball from the idea that she had to what's going to happen this Saturday\nSo I'm really open people will come out and have a lot of fun\nA trade or come on out to the first annual ... festival at nine Fifteen a fellow Brenda boulevard this Saturday dozens of visual artists and performance artist so they're going to be closing streets there'll be sued trucks raffles all the fun festival stuff\nAnyone can come to promote peace an art in the city anything else people need to know\n[noise] what time to start it starts at eleven AM um and I guess anything else that people need to know is that\nWe need to be active in making a change in our city because Jacksonville has a lot of potential and I think if you come\nTo a rise there Saturday you'll see it you'll see the potential and young performers and the young artists and they're all very passionate and dedicated about investing in their city in investing in themselves so please come out and support them and support making a change\nAnd the judge is one thing is that when we unveil the marrow on the Brotherhood of a criminal Sunday the

at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the

our campaign back\nOr if we needed more money we would be more aggressive about going out and getting it\nOr what we have is a limited media market here in Jacksonville with or even though it's a top fifty media market a television was it's very inexpensive to advertise here\nAnd we're able to get our message out a really through targeted Facebook ads which is where we think people are going through the grass roots of canvassing and rallies it's Ira\nLet's talk about a year position sure you're a Democrat your opponents are Republican or if you were elected to the fourth district in Florida what would be your biggest priorities for this district\nSure we'll be talking about the district and we are at a crucial point in the first post ah we've essentially allowed developers to run our planning a\nAnd we had a skyscraper quite frankly that flooded and last tropical storm and we have a servicemen congressional delegation that have done nothing to address the resiliency for our downtown we have in the fourth district which just to define it for people out there who might not have an encyclopedic knowledge of ah\nSpecial districts the fourth district is Nassau County half of Duvall county and almost Ninety percent of St Johns county so it runs from the Georgia border down to St Johns county pass the EPA theater seven hundred and thirty five thousand people\nA number of military bases a suburban sprawl or urban hipster neighborhoods of the oldest city in America\nA and farms\nSo it's incredibly economically diverse district\nOr we need to have a congressman and congressional delegation that has a vision for the future of Jacksonville John rather focus of the opportunity to to set forth a vision for Jacksonville and he hasn't set one fourth and that's where this campaign is is moving forward we're setting forth a vision for this district\nYou know every time it rains the business district in front in Dina Sen Marco St Augustine flood\nParking spaces flood a businesses have sandbags on their front steps every time there's a thunderstorm somebody in the fourth district comes home to find the clock on their microwave is flashing 'cause a power it's gone out\nSo how do we preserve the great quality of life that we have here than most people have relocated here for\nAnd that's by keeping our taxes low\nAnd attracting businesses here what sales pitch do we have as a city in a region if our sales pitches move your business here the power goes out when it rains a and our city's flood\nSo we feel that putting forward it good vision of a of for business and for lifestyle is what makes our campaign different than John Rutherford\nFive for nine to nine three seven to connect with ... he is running for Congress against income that Congressman John rather front give us a call okay\nSo yeah locally in this area there has not been much political will to aggressively respond to the threats posed by sea level rise and more extreme weather events certainly a dress that\nUh well it's it's really something that that\nWe're trying to press down on localities\nWe're trying to get individual cities to have a response to what is a global a problem which is the rise of tides and ... and politically where your listeners fall on climate change uh is is it relevant to this I think anybody who's lived here for more than five years knows there's there's less sand on the beach\nThe water is encroaching on us and it is such a massive task\nThat it isn't something that we can expect the city of St Augustine or for an Indian a feature Amelia Island are part of you to tackle on their own with their own budget and a lot of cases with with citizen or legislators you know people who work day jobs and show up at night to volunteer to be on a planning board\nSo it really requires a federal government uh initiative\nAnd that's where your Congress people have to uh to upon you take their heads out of the sand and admit that the tide is rising and fund resiliency efforts for the whole St john's river watershed\n[noise] what about other issues are for example the port a job creation I'm In a minute ago you mentioned let's create a more business friendly climate with low taxes surely that honestly sounds more like the ... the Republican candidate would say so how ... how would you do that differently\nIf it goes back to the theme of our campaign which is that there are ways to do more with less and to be efficient and that's what we're about it's about being smart taking a dot com approach to being smarter making smarter decisions and spending your money better I come from a background of lean\nStart ups and that is is creating businesses where you're not funded to the hilt and you have to to be really really really frankly brilliant and I don't see brilliance or in our government right now and that's what we need to add to it\nYou know here in Jacksonville\nThe mayor is exploring\nToning the electric utility\nBecause the congressional district the fourth fifth and sixth or has not brought home brown feels remediation money for the shipyards which are contaminated from their days as ... as munitions factories with a with lead and mercury and hard metals\nOr as the mayor's actually exploring toning off the utility to be able to clean up those brown field because no developers will touch that land uh that's why we need a congressional delegation that's working together and trying to come up with creative solutions to solve the problems are I think it's telling that that\nCongressman rather for boasts about money he's obtained for deepening the harbor which brings more water into a city that floods than at any efforts that he has made to protect us from flooding\nIf you're just tuning in we're speaking with fourth district congressional candidate Democrat ... he's running against John rather for for Congress\nWe did ask congressman Rutherford to joined the show today to debate the issues is office didn't respond so let's go to your calls now for the candidate what are your questions and comments five for nine to nine three seven give us a call Kathy is in downtown Jacksonville Hi Cathy good morning\nHi thank you I'm a Democrat I just wanted to say I'm it would be really great I think if you could really talk about your you know your contrast with Mr us whether for\n'em in both points you know things that really affect people like healthcare minimum wage um water you know you're talking about flooding but just really talk about it in a way that it's not you know kind of ideas but really you know maybe some small steps that you would take\nThat would really start to improve the discussion I think I Would really I really feel that that will touch people and that's what people are looking for answers maybe stating the problem and then your answer to the problem I really feel like that would be a way to get people to\nSee you as someone who is a problem so anyway that's my that's my two cents thank\nYou All right thanks for the call I think you know or ... whatever political affiliation people have I think that's what all voters want to hear right now so so what about\nThat or not a morning where the where the governor is interrupting the news cast with with the news of a hurricane hitting hitting the Gulf it we've we've certainly taken the first few minutes here to talk about resiliency and flooding and an infrastructure and I know that that puts a lot of people to sleep and it's very important that\nUh we get out to people as Democrats were not an opposition party we're not going to win next month as an opposition party as a party that's against everything we have to win is a party of ideas you know when I see somebody driving down the street who has a a a Trump bumper sticker or Trump pat\nI don't get mad I I get heartbroken that that somebody who thought that a billionaire game show host had more to offer them than our Democratic Party the Democratic party of of Joe Biden and President Obama and Bill Clinton and uh uh Robert Kennedy and FDR\nYou know what we're running on this year is good democratic values a\nFrightening thing where ... are you from Medicare for all for example like a ... egg and gotten given a turnout candidate Andrew gallon let's talk healthcare front or\nWill talking healthcare first thing is is that I'm I'm One hundred percent behind protecting woman's right to choose and protecting women's access to affordable health care or outside of what goes on with with the Affordable CARE Act a I have a ... stated publicly that I support a Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut his plan to expand Medicare\nI think that there's no way to get to health care for all until you have cost containment and healthcare system and so while I certainly think that's a goal there is an intermediate step you can't have an ... pen that saves a kid's life from a beef sting or a peanut costs five hundred dollars\nAnd you know that was the bargain that was made by by Nancy Pelosi and President Obama when they were passing Obamacare\nIf they believe that they were going to keep Congress and they would have an opportunity than in the second effort or modify the Affordable CARE Act to put cost containment into it\nAnd because they lost Congress ah we've never had that opportunity to put cost containment back into the system and that's what's necessary before I Believe you can talk about ensuring everybody\nI just think that what we could have spent a billion dollars on in Jacksonville on the ground and the first coast as opposed to spending a billion dollars dredging a charge a a a channel obviously we have to maintain the port in the channels are but I don't know that um\nThat that we are looking at that situation I think we're looking at that situation as as being afraid to lose the business we have\nAs opposed to really fishing where shipping will be in in Twenty years and in preparing for that uh for example nobody anticipated the Trump\nOr terrorists or and cutting down the imports from China so we're we're dredging to fifty fifty five feet so that ships from trying to get into our port and now we're restricting ships from China or\nI'm Sorry the last question was a less which was a ... a check on Trump and I'm Amazed that we've gotten almost through the end of the segment without being asked about\nThe right I I think a lot of Democrats right now are hoping for Congress to flip to democratic control because they see that they believe that the president needs to be checked and his administration and the only vehicle to do that is through Congress Republicans on the other hand\nA do not want that to happen and they are very engaged in keeping Republican control of Congress so\n... how much is the presidency factoring into your campaign when you go out and talk about these issues\nWell it's a few ways the first thing is is that most everybody or or or a large majority Republican or Democrat or really distressed by the lack of decorum and the conduct of the president and the way that he is has demean the office at the presidency um he is acting more like a Bobby Riggs male chauvinist pig\nOr in the last week and he's acting like a leader of the free world uh\nUh he was left out on stage and at the un and important thing to to know is that\nAmerica is a the world's policemen that doesn't mean that we can willy nilly bring about regime change any country we feel like it but when we don't lead the world as as a political and moral authority\nOr other countries step into that void and it's not England and France the country's step in China and Russia and Iran and we have an obligation to be a world leader and to to be a shining city on the hill a and\n... would you support impeachment proceedings against the president if if you were elected to Congress and the Congress let\nLet him a letter to Congress and Congress does flip a band and Robert Mueller present charges to the Congress Ah yes I Would certainly uh\nDo you believe written has committed impeachable offenses\nI Believe that is that his family has committed criminal offenses and certainly his his staffing advisors have at ... pled guilty or as an attorney um\nYou're it's reinforced in you that you're not the judge the jury and the executioner and so you know my attorney or in ... says\nUh don't convict somebody before you've heard the chargers from the grand jury a but there's a lot of smoke for they're not to be any fire and I would definitely expected that a Democratic Congress would want to look into what this president has done\nLet's go to one more call for Jeff ... speech Elizabeth you're on the air\nI Am I going to comment that I didn't mean eight without Ben and um you know I I Wonder because you are in a meeting with a primary but I Can't\nWork court bird\nAnd that state um house race around 'em Dan anything to do with this\nUpcoming allow any campaign signs yeah just campaign signs and I'm a bank\nAnd now I'm just you know what are your friends about and get on out and shop and I obviously will start talking about you expect that part everything you're saying I'm just saying wow it\nDoesn't even seen it on anyone's mind out\nYeah by yeah can I can address that um I Hope you're you're still listening to things one is that a\nRepublican owned businesses don't let Democrats put their signs up\nSo we have a large problem you've looked upon of Egypt for example a when a there's maybe three or four commercial clauses and then you have gated communities that don't allow signs so we're up to the mercy of individual a property owners if they'll allow us to put democratic signs on there you are on their intellectual plazas so\nThat's why ... looks like it's a hundred percent read but it's actually a purple town but it's just it's just the effect of of that um the second thing is that you know and I have to tell this story\nUh we've been trying to get press we actually have been going back and forth with the times union Joe fed and uh one of the editors over there and uh she actually sent back where it through that and then the other day or the other week that you\nKnow between between now this was September between the end of September November six because of budget cuts we're just not going to have a reporter available to do a story on you that's what your newspaper told the major party nominee for Congress in a year that all anyone can talk about is Congress so\nYou know we recognize that what we've done is we've done out of the box things to get press or one of the things we're doing next week's we're doing a a a unity concert we're putting all the cops are the part of your concert hall\nOr we're inviting all the Democratic candidates and anybody wants to learn about us and we have a wonderful country singer who's coming down from Nashville or who heard about us and a volunteer so we're gonna have a concert for for unity next week on Wednesday October seventeenth\nOkay and that's coming out next Wednesday punter concert hall and we appreciate you being here
