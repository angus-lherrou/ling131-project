newsmakers of the first coast\nComing up this morning what are the next steps in the Russia probe we speak with author Greg Miller of the Washington Post about his new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy that and more ahead this hour on first 'cause connect\nFrom the special counsel [noise] you know the president went on sixty minutes last night and he was asked about this question Lesley Stahl challenged him about uh the\nPerception that he's very wary of criticizing Vladimir Putin's he denied that she also asked him a about Russian interference in the twenties sixteen election\nHe said that he agreed there was Russian meddling but that he feels China is a bigger threat to the United states I'm just curious to get your thoughts about that interview and what the president said\nI think it's astonishingly here we are two years later we're still asking president of the United states whether he believes Russia interfered in twenty sixteen and he's still equivocal\nTwo years later he's still not clear about it with the American public refusing to often deflecting right in this case last night he's really pointing fingers in other directions including a China [laughter] don't just you know\nFrustrating inability to old somebody accountable it's something that really as significant consequences for us as a country because I'm the lesson from\nFrom this for Russia we used was man did we achieve a lot of impact for very little investment\nAnd the United states sort of has to remain vulnerable to that when the president refuses to acknowledge it refuses to take any steps\nSort of make sure that it doesn't happen again\nGo to your calls in a moment for Pulitzer Prize winning author Greg Miller of the Washington Post his new book is called The Apprentice Trump for us\nYeah and this and version of American democracy in the number to join us for nine to nine three seven now you call your book The Apprentice this sort of a\nTake on the fact that of course Donald Trump rose to fame with that reality show but you now or implying that he is an apprentice and his role as presidents in his uh\n... to ... is that the the implication of the title of the book\nIs I mean it's a little tongue in cheek but I mean you write so to me the title works on a couple of different levels one you're right he just this is the title of the TV show that propelled him to such great fame and the United states\nTo you know the word apprentice sort of means somebody who sort of getting on the job training and that's what Trump has been as president right he arrived in office having never held public office having never looked at a classified document had little little\nPreparation and needed tons of how to learn on the job and\nThere's also this other part of the word\nApprentice which ... ... and said I'm subservient and\nThis is one of the core kind of\nOdd questions that just hangs over Trump\nWhat is it what accounts for his surveillance heat to Vladimir ... why does he consistently stick to\nThe Kremlin is talking points why can't he never sort of criticized the Russian President or why does he since taking office why has Trump consistently tried to block any policy measure or punitive measure that would displeased the Russian leader\nDo you believe based on your own reporting and what is publicly verifiable\nThat the Russians have some sort of the term is compromise compromising material on President\nYou know I don't know and I don't think anybody perhaps Robert Mueller has an answer to that question I'm\nObviously that with a theory I'm In a surfaced in something we call the Steele dossier which was a research done by a former British spy who who had\nSources inside Russia saying that that uh the Kremlin had um images or information about Trump consulting with prostitutes [laughter] when he went to Moscow and twenty Thirteen for the Miss Universe pageant those allegations have never been proven that could be true they might not be we just don't know but um\nI think that you know the the ... ... what we're trying to get outta here is what explains\nWhat could explain the way Trump behaves toward ... and I think it's just a more complicated question I think part of it is just sort of deals with the core of Trump's personality his admiration\nFor the kind of leader he thinks that Vladimir pollutant is his envy of the kind of arrangement that ... and has as president of Russia where there is no opposition there is no opposition party there is no justice department that's going to investigate Vladimir ... there's no critical\nThere is no very little a free press in Russia capable of challenging Vladimir potent and I mean honestly\nWouldn't Trump loved to have that identical arrangement here he sort of acts like that all the time\nYou're a a Pulitzer Prize winner at the post in part because you've broken a lot of stories related to the Trump administration's ties to Russia ... your story about former national security adviser Michael Flynn was a big one you reveal that Flynn had discussed us sanctions\nWith Russian officials prior to\nPresident Trump's inauguration you recently told NPR that you realized uh after you rent a memo written by former FBI Director Jim Comey that when the president or was saying he believed reporters should be put in jail that he was referring to you is that right\n[laughter] that's right yeah uh I didn't learn that until many months later but you know Jim call me when he was FBI Director\nKept detailed memos every time he interacted with President Trump he would go back\nTo the computer and put together a memo I'm taking down notes of what they had talked about because he was so troubled by what he was being asked to do in some cases [noise]\nOne of those memos talks about a conversation that he and Trump had in the oval office after Flynn had been forced out when the FBI was investigating plan which Trump is asking Khomeini can you see your way clear to letting Flynn go don't pursue this case against him\nThat says the same conversation Trump is trying to say look the real issue here is leaks the real issue here the real crime as what people are saying about me [laughter] ah and he goes on to describe the stories that he was really upset about these are stories that revealed\nA the contents of his conversations with foreign leaders including the president to Mexico and\nUh he says uh we need to put reporters in jail and he's talking about the stories that I had written right he's talking about me he's talking about my sources he's telling me we need to put reporters in jail and call me as a green ... saying yeah I Would love to put some heads on bikes here as an example\nIt was a really difficult to [laughter] ah in jarring to read that\nWe'll talk some more about uh your reporting about the firing of Jim Comey from the FBI and other details inside the new book The Apprentice it's Trump Russia and the subversion of American democracy let's go to your calls now for Greg Miller the Washington Post\nFine for nine to nine three seven give us a call Chuck is in Jacksonville beach I check the morning go ahead\nOh come on guys let's lock talking to you on my cell phone and I just want to let you know ... ... if your computer and your bombs and your government they're not going away\nThey've been here forever and they will be here forever and I guess my question is well two thousand or ... while under the Obama administration\nWhat was the CIA doing they had no idea\nThat the Russians and shiny and Israelis and every other\nCountry on the planet into our system of what happened to Bernie Sanders was the Democratic administration and look what we get Angela\nWeek and I looked at a Bill Clinton Obama they try to influence righty allege this has been going on forever and I think that a Russian and the shiny and the Israelis are not going to the hacking into our system\nIs by thinking nobody's going to be happening in your computer\nI'm surprised that anybody shock at\nYeah things check and I think you're right about that I think the the the question that's hanging out there though is did the Trump campaign coordinate with this effort Greg Miller\nYeah I think there's something else to I'm a real important distinction to make sure the caller is right that there I'm getting ready to states engages in hacking operations to steal secrets from other countries\nAnd many other countries do the same against us all over the world\nChina Iran North Korea not just Russia U.S intelligence agencies did see\nA Russian penetration of the DNC pretty early on in fact it was the Netherlands the intelligence service of the Netherlands that initially called there that the attention of that operation to the NSA I'm In the United states [laughter] what what\nWhat the US government with us spy agencies in the public didn't see what was that Russia was\nGoing to change the playbook in a really really important and dramatic way and twenty sixteen [noise] like I said I'm going to go all countries spy all countries capable of it at least spy on other countries but\nIn this case Russia took what it had stolen bright all of these emails these ... district ... trove of files from the DNC and other networks and then just threw it out on the Internet\nIn front of the world to embarrass humiliate Hillary Clinton to sow discord in American democracy so they took that information they got and then they weaponized it and that is not something that we\nThis is Ira Glass of this American Life and I'm coming to Jacksonville even talk that costs seven things I've learned you basically just an excuse to help out your

[noise]\n[noise] well come back well the U.S navy was founded nearly two hundred fifty years ago on October thirteenth Seventeen Seventy five\nThat was over the weekend and we're marking the celebration of the Navy's birthday with a unique perspective\nIn any branch of service for women racial minorities algae Beatty troops serving can often be an isolating sometimes frightening experience\nFirst coast author and retired naval surface warfare officer Keith Greene tells his story of navy service and the new bug black officer white navy and he joins us now ... good morning so I guess you were at a celebration for the navy spread over the weekend is that right\nYes I was I've spoken to come on a country club the Jacksonville pin women invited me to be speaker for the month of October and uh I really enjoyed it very gracious\nThe Navy's founded at the height of our revolution and back in Seventeen Seventy five pretty amazing absolutely yeah OK and of course it was an all white or navy in those days are but ...\nAs the military became integrated after particularly after World War two uh the services became more diverse but of course the navy like really all of the branches of the military had a well documented history of racism and sell as an African American who served your stories really fascinating\nBeginning with your dad before you came along tell me about it\nOne of my father served in Korea he was a paratrooper he joined the army at Seventeen his father died when he was twelve in the VA hospital and my father joined the navy at Seventeen\nAnd uh I mean yes Seventeen and he wound up a spending about Fifteen sixteen years in the navy he told me when I came in a set I was going to join the navy I'm not going to talk of the papers for you to join because the Navy's to racist\nYou know and I said no that's changed ... the ... you know has said that those days are over there is no black maybe there is no white neighbor there's only one day a took just a couple of years for me to figure out my father did have a bit more insight then I realized\nWhat happened to you after you joined up\nWell I went to my first school doesn't mind men and they'd be mom and I was one of the very few ah black young men that came in and got a guaranteed a school and I was gung ho I bought the T shirt had the hat you know drank the Kool Aid\nBut once I got into my ... school in Charleston South Carolina I was hitting a pretty quickly with the you know blatant racism or qualified for accelerate advancement of the number two student in my class\nThey changed my grade so that I didn't get the honor roll and then they told me that I couldn't accept the accelerated investment we are with this this was Nineteen Seventy five okay this is a few months before the navy had his first affirmative action plan\nOkay so what how did you react to that\nWell I had a I was young and green I didn't know what to do so I went to my reserve unit and when I checked into my reserve unit the personnel when they're at the\nDesk looks up from a record a surprise and says hey you qualify for accelerate advancement day for why didn't you take did you know that I said yes and he said well why don't you take it I said well they told me I couldn't get it\nAnd he looked at me with this critical look and I knew that I'd been lying to but we had a class it started out with twenty five or twenty six students and we only graduated seven is very difficult class uh but they just didn't want me the navy had changed but uh at the ... level you still had some entrenched attitude that were hostile to minorities\nIn your buck black officer white navy you write about uh being a black officer as though it was an extra job an extra layer of responsibility ... what do you mean by that\nWhat I mean by that is often times I Would be set up to fail a it was often times I felt like I wasn't getting the support I needed from subordinate superiors or my peers I'll give you one example I was getting ready to deploy for six months to cruise to the Persian Gulf\nAnd my very own supply officer wasn't ordering the parts that I needed to get underway I talked to my my other department heads I talked to the XO the captain finally and desperation I had to create this report out of thin air and walked in and gave it to the captain I stayed up all night man one must apply petty officers\nAnd I walked into the kept us bitter if I don't get these parts of my twenty five most critical parts of I don't get these parts to ship doesn't apply on time if it doesn't deploying time you're going to have to explain that to somebody because I have explained to you what my problems are\nHe called us ... up\nA display else couldn't answer why wasn't ordering parts and everyone else is getting theirs so the end result was splashed got yelled at and get to like the report so much he had made he made all the other department at scrape the same report so I had to teach them how to do it now they're all mad at me because they got out of work to do the decision to me so that's the extra job part of it\nYeah yeah had one example of having to overcompensate for the structural racism that was was there at at the time and you know\nIt it does is not a unique story ab ... either in the military or in the in the civilian world but in the military when it's like a life or death situation racism gets in the way\nAbsolutely it affects unit cohesion it affects the ability to trust each other and it affects the mission\nOr I'll give you another example I was a tactical action also in the Persian Gulf\nI was responsible for fighting that ship if we entered a minefield we were attacked by small boat if we had missiles coming in as as a hit the USS dark I gave a chief petty officer in order and he ignored my order and walked out of the room without\nA complying with the order that I'd given him when I put him on report which is exactly what I was supposed to do your department and the executive office and the captain all tried to get me to push that down which would severely limit my uh authority in that circumstance I needed everyone to do what we're supposed to happen\nOr when it was supposed to have in someone's questioning my authority that puts the ship at risk\nWell how do you feel the navy is doing today on these issues\nI think the navy or I'm worried that the navy might be going backwards both on the racial issues and also on the the female issues just yesterday or just friday on um um the ...\nBefore the Navy's birthday the chief of naval operations was chastised by the uh DOD inspector general for failure to properly handle some sexual harassment sexual assault complaints against officer on his staff\nMaybe has gotten a lot of bad press what we had a ship us or Shiloh that called it the USS prison chip you can Google that\nThe captain refused to allow his crew to celebrate black history month he was handing out bread and water like it was candy and also a they knew the navy knew that the morale on the ship was going down consistently every six months that due to climate surveys but the captain finished out of this tour\nA animal show our who was the first black force are female a animal in the navy she retired or just last year but a few years before that a rear admiral was relieved because he was disparaging minority officers of particularly minority flag officers and um he said that we\nDon't have this problem in in the aviation maybe because we don't let 'em in or we handle it if they get and we'd get rid of him so he was relieved and had to retire but there are other indications that there's there may be some problems in the navy\nAnd on the other hand the me too movement has swept the nation both the civilian and military population so there's a lot of attention being paid now the gender inequality absolutely a which does intersect with racial inequality\nOne of my big concerns right now is that since\nThe year two thousand the navy in a department of defense has refused to release statistics on discrimination in the navy that used to be they published published them in their annual defense report\nBut under Donald Rumsfeld they stopped doing that it hasn't changed so no one really knows what's happening a lot of attention is being paid to the me too movement but not very much in the Arab discrimination because it's difficult to get the statistics I had to follow freedom of Information Act request to get some of the statistics are used for my book\nAnd I was on the verge of suing the department of defense with help from a non profit because I really needed those numbers and because I worked in that field I knew that they were there and they should be available I've actually got um\nYou did and there in the book I'm so knowing what you know uh having served would you would you do it all again if you have the choice is er and would you encourage young people to sign up and serve in the military today\nI Would encourage dollars I Would encourage anyone to join the military the military was the best decision I ever made the problem I had with that was where the rubber meets the road do you have these uh uh procedures in place but it'd be individuals that are responsible for\nDoing that are not doing it then the ... the programs are no good but I'd encourage anyone to join the military you still feel the the good outweighs the bad\nOh of course I Love the navy I always have I wouldn't be putting myself out there criticizing the navy if I didn't believe in the organization sometimes you get your best input your best information from the customers who takes time to fill up the survey that's why you offered them things that will entice them to do so\nAn awful psychologically\nHe's still trying to sort out what that means to be free\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air producer Sam brittle recorded with se ... author of the new novel
