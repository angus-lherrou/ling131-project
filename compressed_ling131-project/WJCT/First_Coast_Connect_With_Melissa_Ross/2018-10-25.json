Jacksonville your community your world\n[noise]\n\nFrom politics and public affairs to arts and entertainment first kiss connect connects you to everything that's happening across the northeast Florida I'm militarized get plugged in as we interview the most compelling newsmakers of the first coast [noise]\nComing up this morning new data from across every region of Florida looking at the human toll of the opioid epidemic also keeping yourself safe on line it's national cyber security might that in more I had this hour on first cars can act [noise]\nUm we are very fortunate to partner with Florida blue and two of our providers life's dream and Meridian behavioral health care I'm located in both Gainesville in Leesburg\nAnd the model that we've adopted and working with Florida blue is really let's look at getting in and an earlier stage um let's look at training health care professionals particularly in emergency departments\nTheir physicians to die ... attacked\nOn an early level who might be coming in with an undiagnosed\nSubstance abuse disorder um so we are rolling out training for the Asperger which stands for screening brief intervention referral and treatment it's a brief screening\nThat when the physicians offer it they are able to get a quick score and detect whether an individual might be struggling with a substance abuse disorder or we're going to place peer specialist as well as clinicians and the primary care\nFacilities as well as our emergency departments in these areas or two then\nHelp that individual motivate them to consider treatment\nThat we can really move them along a into recovery that's the goal recovery is possible absolutely I don't want anyone to think that there is not help recovery is possible and ah we just need to get folks to help that they need\nNow Pat Garrett he let me ask you as well how does this public health emergency impact your business [noise] how how does how does this affect a major insurer\nWell it affects us in a lot of ways when we lay out our mission is a company or mission is to help people and communities achieve better health\nSo this is something that is impacting the health of individuals and our communities\nOne of the things we did first was to look at the prescription and the length of the prescription that were being given in the community as a standard I can speak to last year I had knee surgery I was given a thirty day supply of opioids I needed one day\nSo now I have twenty nine days of ... opioids sitting in my home that's where this crisis developed some people take it for too long some people keep it around in their home and now it's available to their children and so we're getting ahead of that\nSo we work with the Florida Legislature to limit but wait for the prescriptions we're also doing a lot around education because there are many over the counter drugs that could take the place of opioids for a wide variety of pain situations\nLike what what would be a good substitute\nIt could be Tylenol there could be ... be a number of different ... yeah ... vets do just as good a job\nAnd Dr ... do you feel that doctors have gotten the memo on tightening up how freely they use to prescribe opioids uh\nI I Do um and and we really want to applaud the Florida Legislature for moving that are important piece of legislation forward because now in Florida um doctors are allowed to just prescribe three\nUh opioid pills um and you know one thing that we need to really recognizes that opioids are utilize for acute pain not chronic pain so they never should have been prescribed on a long term\nBasis but they and sadly they were and that's how so many people went from pain relief to seeking out street fat and all that at en route overdosing indeed and the brain chemistry of people's factors in as well not everyone is going to the as pat said get a prescription\nTake a few pills and get addicted some people are more at risk than others but we still don't know a lot about that aspect of this public health crisis do we there's no it's not easy to predict who might be more susceptible to becoming addicted\nRight well there certainly is a genetic component to addiction um and you know when a person does have that genetic predisposition they are much higher risk other factors um play in as well but you know you can really become quickly addicted\nTo opioids and that is the danger of this fraud\nAnd if you're just tuning in as we speak with Florida blue and LSF health systems about the new data looking at the full scope of the opioid crisis in Florida\nWhat are your thoughts comments and questions at five for nine to nine three seven to give us a call John is on the line Hi John good morning you're on the air\nHi John you're on the air\nHey I'm Sorry I'm my wife is dealing with chronic pain and has been for years I think everybody's on the right track as far as monitoring\nUsage for short term and it might be\nThat after seven days you call somebody back in for re evaluation book for people who are I guess functionally ... because they have to take this medication\nEvery day of their lives are concerned that we're setting up barriers we're starting up scores that are personalized we're putting doctors in a position to take this and put the generic kind of quiet and they are specific situation that could be a challenge\n...\n[noise] well I think first of all each individual case is it's it\nHas to be judged on its own merits and that's why you need a clinician involved in that\nBut you also need to make sure that you have the bright pain management advice being given to the provider not all providers of care or as first in pain management\nAs others and so that's part of having experts that are in this equation so I understand your concern\nOne of the things we're very concerned about and we want to educate on is taking the stigma away from people who are in in addicted state it really needs to be treated as a medical condition\nAnd not a condition that in an advanced they become something that law enforcement and courts are dealing with\nAnd that's why at our forum we have law enforcement and we had a judge there to talk about their perspective\nBecause it's really important that we're looking at this holistic way\nDo you feel the criminal justice system is Bree\nFraming the way they look at addiction and and how punitive they can be with individuals who are addicted\nI think the learning is starting to emerge I think people are starting to move down that path and I think it's really important that we use the society do not turf to law enforcement and courts the resolution of an issue that is medical and so I think we have a real obligation to step up as a medical community\nDr phil do agree that in your head\nAbsolutely agree and I'm at Alice have health systems were very involved in working with sheriff's departments um judges other individuals and that apartment of corrections\nUm to really educate and raise awareness that addiction is a brain disease it's a chronic disease just like heart disease diabetes and other diseases it should not be criminalized\nAnd so we're offering training like mental health first aid um we're offering training and um crisis intervention training for our law enforcement personnel to to help them understand or about addiction and mental illness and not criminalize this health crisis\nSet to miss is on the line is that your name good morning you're on the air\n\nAre you in that hey you're on the morning said\nBack in the early seventies I had a impacted the um with them and they move to first description for a cold it was a combination of coding and to see them and if that was one of the good guy back then\nThat the same thing happened I mean yeah I don't remember that I remember the other day about\nThe bottom to which are full and I filled out that the scriptures square for that one and and I saw that I don't use them on and then I fill the other five and then never heard of people getting it from that a few years ago\nI had a surgery and I was really bad and they gave me one of the modern opioids and it turned out the list for abdominal surgery because the causes of the nation and then the drug\nThat you know you're supposed to pay to relieve the conservation ... I'm a chicken take a day and it's not enough to combat the the the\nThe the the scene in Coney combination works so well why do they come up\nIs are so there's a lot but it's happening a I started before by mentioning that we were the largest advocate for limiting the size of the prescription that was important first step\nUh in addition to that first step is\nUh we've also been doing things like a grant to LSF to be looking at alternative ways of treating of folks federal before they're fully addicted to opioids we also gave a grant to an organization called yoga for change\nSo we're looking for alternative sources and we need to see evidence that it works so and if\nYou do then maybe you cover those treatments for a more broad way right\nSo in any place that you're you look in the in the medical field you need evidence you need to try something you need to see it that it can work as white clinical trials happened that's why we give grants to alternative for the procedures if we get evidence that that's going to take hold in work\nThen we're we're very interested in advocating for benefit changes once again those happen at a state level where you have to get it approved through the new tore process\nYeah surely it's complicated but I'm Dr coffee and what about that it is certainly a lot of patients seek out those ... even if insurance isn't covering them because they just fine relief that way\nAbsolutely and um again a big shout out to Florida blue for being a leader in 'em and looking at alternative ways to manage pain\nI certainly support any type of alternative methods that is not going to cause harm and in fact improve\nPatient's pain level um acupuncture as the caller mentioned um yoga\nA and other automatic candidates I think she also mentioned Canada absolutely and there's a lot of research going on now regarding of the advocacy of cannabis soil ah so I think that um when the research is is completed and we're finding through clinical trials that\nAre this certainly is an effective means to treat pain I Would not be surprised if that's going to be on the list for reimbursement\nKaren in Mandarin he Karen you're on the air\n[noise] Hi my question I Want to know why should I think at what\nIn the nineteenth century and\nThat's just gossip about you know once it's just it's I mean of course they didn't know what their point\nOf that money I mean everything else and\nYou know like there's no and\nI Can't believe we're talking joined in shark because I was well aware of the first time I ever heard of their medical\nOh why do they go out to be terrible I mean I guess well\nNow we're losing her but uh I we get your point Karen okay she's angry a lot of people are angry about that\nYeah look I there's blame to go around but one of the things from it insurance standpoint is if the FDA is approving a drug\nFor use and as part of a benefit profile we have to cover it so that's really where it comes from initially\nUm and so we look to the FDA we look to the medical community to set standards\nAnd those standards are the ones that were were operating off of when I made my comment earlier about pharma big pharma did a lot of educating of the overall community the FDA and physicians and what they thought they found\nAnd you can also a draw your own conclusions about what was driving pharma but that's where I think it would drive came\nFrom the big pharmaceutical companies made a lot of money off of this\nUh and it it truly is blood money I mean there's no getting around that doctor and and at the same time doctors ...\nI'm just saying this anecdotally but what are your thoughts about the perception that doctors just accept what\nThe pharmaceutical sales rep says they come by with the the line of powder\nAnd oh this jargon grade and your patients are going to limit and they just kind of their busy they're overworked they say okay yeah that's\nGood uh and and this in a in a way that's what\nLed to this crisis\nYou're absolutely right Melissa and um I I I don't want to\nImply that are all doctors um you know knowingly knew that this would be addictive but prescribed anyway I think you're absolutely right there were other factors they were getting pressure from I'm from their medical group from their hospitals that they were I'm working for to\nMake sure that they were adequately treating patients pain and big pharma was very much involved in\nLegislation to again make pain or as the this vital signed the heat is scores\nSo um there's there's blamed to be you know had all around systemically uh it's it's has created a real monster in our community is very much like you say\nBig tobacco and I think there's going to be severe consequences I'm particularly for big pharma\nTerritory to show treatment needs to be universally available and immediately accessible thanks for helping to move this forward we did a segment on the show just a week or two ago with Lakeview health were they pointed out that everyone should have a nasal spray of ... can in their home or office\nIn case you see someone who's or you have a loved one who you think is at risk of overdose a shot of narcan will save their life and it it cannot harm anyone it can only help so just wanted to make that quick point let's take one more call it's Scott in orange park high Scott

plugged in as we interview the most compelling newsmakers of the first coast\nComing up this morning a nasty second debate between Florida gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum and Ron dissent is as the vice president stumps in Florida for the Republican that in more I had this hour on first 'cause connect\nWhat I Would have done is pushed for stronger bill\nA missile defenses should acknowledge who's endorsed by the n._r._a. or another or a entities\nWhich he is wholly accountable and owned by when I took on the in our age they sued management me through corporate two years old because we had a city ordinance which said you could not shoot guns in city parks when we win this race it will be simple it's not a threat to the second amendment if you want to own the power of God at your waist vote you ought to have a background check\nIf you want to have you on domestic violence is he's a convicted you shouldn't have a gun that you can solve a lot of your loved one when our parents or our kids off at school we should have an expectation\nThat we'll be able to pick them up a lot of time\nAnd by the way the moderator struggle to keep these two candidates to time not a strong moderate yeah\nOkay so All right so you\nSee Andrew Gillum then as as more meeting the mood of the moment that said early voting is underway\nRepublicans so far are up at pacing Democrats in the overall vote totals and so for both of these candidates Mr Gillum and Mr does San is turning out their base is everything it\nDo you feel both of them accomplish those goals last night as they hit on all of these major issues\nFor you I mean you know I think both of them reached out to their bases are going to get between eighty Ninety percent of their respective parties polling has basically showing the pole in fact we shouldn't go I'm In the nineties I don't know if that's going to hold but the swing voters are really the ones that\nYou know trying to be reached with this and that's where the plane to doesn't last night between the two candidates and that's where we're going to favor the Santa went into that debate I think he could message off of\nYou know Gillum scandals including the Hamilton tickets that you know he got from the FBI according to a\nYou know data was release released this week\nI'm you know and and the fans can capitalize\nSo I mean you know kill and got the line and we got nine nine problems by Hamilton a one yeah and that's the one that people are gonna remember 'em in the Santa says tone is not something that is appealing and swing voters and the way the Gillum says you know and that's where the corruption narrative came in and you know the famous really couldn't close the deal on it last night\nWhat about vice president Mike Pence coming to Jacksonville to campaign for just sent us in the Republican ticket how big of a difference DC that making for Republicans\nUm I you know I've talked to play some go where the Republican Party chair of the state and he said that Pence was here to drive based turned out I mean that's the thing they're wanting to get the early votes or Jacksonville they're going to increase the margin here\nIn the Santa so sad that this region's key to you know his strategy and he's pulled better go I'm here so basically is running up the number ... safe media market for parents\nUm you know it's not quite like down south where you might become more adversarial way it'll be friendly coverage it'll it'll be one more Pence comes out and makes cases that Gillum is not right for the state the Gillum is off base and corrupt and too far to the left and to extremely Mike Pence is very good\nAt you know selling the Southern Baptist tones that appeal to a certain type of voter about er swing voters going to respond to Mike Pence no this is for the base\nOkay and let me ask you this uh out of all the issues in this race guns education\nImmigration a race itself\nLots of issues are on the menu but those undecided voters there are anecdotal indications that some of them are moving to kill him over the issue of health care and coverage for pre existing conditions do you think ... that that issue will be decisive or not or in this race\nThere's something the Democrats are betting heavily on not just in the governor's race but up and down the ballot um you know if you look at any contested race to resisting conditions question comes in we see it with the Senate race between Scott and also even see with Nancy Soderberg Mike ... congressional race down south\nUm these are this is a big issue I don't know if that's going to be the one that actually balances with voters Rick Scott as saying that he's force protection of presenting conditions to Santa says that\nUm Trump says that the Republicans are saying these things which makes you wonder what was happening in the last two years when you know the mantra was repeal and replace Obamacare there was no mention of pre existing conditions in there so Democrats are hoping that voters remember that um I\nI'm skeptical that is really going to stick and the way they're hoping um it's sort of an esoteric thing unless you have health issues in which case it's a primary thing but in that case you're probably leaning Democrat anyway\nLet's go to your calls now as we talk about last night's big debate the final one thank goodness [laughter] I think it'd be hard to watch some time or they get so ugly between Rhonda Santos and Andrew Gillum for governor as vice president Pence came to town and the political\nSeason is

Reginald and you know he's so right at\n... it's frightening what's happening now or the suspicious packages these pipe bombs that were delivered Twitter is now reporting a multiple sites including the Associated Press that Joe Biden I guess just received one of us as well\nUm\nThe rhetoric the anger the threats of violence um the demonizing of your political opponent this is a dangerous place for this country to be and\nIt's a familiar place for his country to be a time and time again you see demonization of political opponents I mean go back to the Eighteen Nineteen centuries and you can see things that wouldn't fly today things that you know would not be done by an official campaign being done and can't you know campaigns that just hadn't gotten forgotten\nYou know what we're seeing now is we're seeing the stakes were bigger on all sides corporations put more money and behind the Republican side to unions and all that on the Democratic side and you know it is a clash I mean it's not a negotiating time\nYou know that brief period of the mid to late ... century where you saw a bipartisan consensus in issues\nI Believe that's over and it's going to be a turf war for a while it may be true for the rest of our lifetimes because\nThe issues that we're facing or issues scarcity of she's a resource allocation issues of why we diversion narratives um I don't think you just work it out with the can buy all moment it's going to take a lot of conflicts can take a lot of political careers rising and falling\nAnd a lot of debate like we saw last night I think that's the future not an ... nominally\nI I I agree um now that said and as you correctly pointed out this country has been in these this place many times before it can\nBe easy to forget that but at the same time that this is not good for America to have\nPeople that hateful towards each other and to see the other political party is evil I mean you know I I Know families that had been torn apart torn apart by this they don't speak anymore\nAnd the you know you have to go back almost to the civil war to to to see that kind of a\nOutcome ... it's it's tragic and this is true this is tragic that this tribalism is tragic and it's it's frightening I think and um\nYou know we can joke about the ... flung on television in a debate but this is a serious time this is a frightening time for many Americans\nYeah it is and I mean you really dealing with two candidates that are kind of mirror image to each other in some ways both and came up from working class roots you know both of them have you been in politics for a while now and then he both of showing real ambition I mean\nAnd they play to their respective wings I mean Gillum this play to Soros wing you know he did the troops with people for the American way the troops to I'll be in ... in places like that you know and and the St Louis on his side he's had a place for the right way he did the\nThe conferences with David Horowitz the restoration weekends or freedom we can do whatever they're called you did for those conferences and people like well why did you do those conferences rather than the real answers when he can't speak which is if you are working as a politician you don't come for money you got to take this speaking fees\nAnd innocent both these guys have played to the wings of their parties are comfortable in that space\nUm you know and it's really I I think we're seeing the future\nUm of politics in this country I mean there'll be more interesting ones will be more rounded saying this is not less I mean this is the generation that's coming up and they're playing the game that's been set set forth by you know old white billionaires from both sides and both of them want as much noise and much volume as much cognitive dissonance says\nOkay and let's get a few more calls in check out at the beach is check you voted already you said\nYes ma'am I voted yesterday ethical then thirty three ... spent two hours on the computer [noise] got it done of figuring out where I mean but I wanted to remind you got something he talked about going all the way back to the civil war what am I\nI'm sixty six greatest heroes in my lifetime Martin Luther king the Freedom Riders men and women who fought on the streets of Mississippi and Alabama\nThat was tough I think it was a convention in Chicago where there was a lot of trouble [noise]\nSo they're saying nothing new it's been going on for a long time and it always will Bernie Sanders is why I Am a Republican a straight Republican but Bernie Sanders is right I ... on Social Security Medicare I spent forty one hundred dollars a year and a shot on there so we can have\nWe can have a Medicare for everyone but ... we can't do it I think we spend about ... percent of our gross toll on his insurance and are people will vote based\nOn the second amendment\nAnd they will vote on pro life\nAnd what and what not and throw your vote to vote straight just because you're a lifelong Republican or was there a particular issue this time\nI'm pretty much in tune with a right wing conservative values except\nOn with Bernie standard on Medicare and personally I watched both debate I think this gentleman that is a Republican he graduated from Yale he graduated from Harvard actually every eight different I thought it was extremely comes\nExtremely well um and I thought the gentleman that Democrats used a lot of words that he shouldn't have use I guess that you should go that direction he might get more voters if he was a little more gracious\nOkay All right well I I I I appreciate your calling check sharing your thoughts thanks Chuck\nYeah I I don't I don't know if Andrew Gillum was going to reach the six six six year old white man who is so true Republican I'm that's basically a GOP based right there\nYou know and and it's interesting though his his take on Medicare and Social Security as it relates to you know this race because\nYou know ... around the sand is has been very slow on putting his policies after he put his health care policies such as it is up during the debates on his website you mean yeah yeah and you know so you nobody knew where he's still in health care and nobody really knows where he sings and helped her no because it's a it's a fragmentary policy they haven't bothered to roll out\nSo you have to wonder what round the same as really ones besides to continue the status quo means continue the status quo is not a plant um you know Rick Scott came in eight years ago\nAnd you know he was responding to conditions that were true in two thousand two thousand these hands generation\nWhere it's really remarkable the degree to which\nThe electorate has moved on and now the idea of Medicare for all is not seen as radical anymore\nOr coverage for pre existing conditions is now the bass line and so that you know whereas ten years ago even five years ago that was very controversial so you see Republicans kind of scrambling to move to where the voters have moved on this small\nUm yeah I mean that's that's typically Republican way which is\nYou know stay on the tour history and you know stop and what isn't stopped jump on the train\nBut you know when you look at what's happening to voters this economically driven I think on both sides really because the two thousand a recession a lot of people didn't see recovery from it personally the larger economy theoretically recovered but we've seen a wealth redistribution in the bombing years and now the Trump beers\nTo have prove was corporations privileged to Pluto crass\nAnd we see a vastly different country and when people can't afford health care when people can't afford to go to when people work as hard as they can and they're not only not getting ahead but they're falling behind\n'em then they're going to be working for government to do more because the was a fair trickle down approach hasn't worked for them\nLet's take one more call Susan in Mandarin Hi Susan go ahead\nPrime Melissa I just want to let people know I you know I'm a Christian I'm a former prosecutor and form a bond for that and I have been some very similar to mine were targets of our history and I've been following it\nSince the beginning of his career many years ago and I can tell people without a doubt he is it because they're a cater of the highest order and he is the exhibits slobber and their ability\nTo whoever it is that has bought him when he first started it was big sugar and I kept point oh I'm is bought and sold by little trick that are far afield at outside of the state of Florida\nFor one thing that voters should understand is that what ... what is not\nTo help the people of Florida rocket scientist is a consummate politician and Florida is just to stop on his way to bigger and better things he absolutely will not take free money from the federal government in order to help the people of Florida weather Social Security Medicare expansion or any\n... now the Medicaid expansion is almost ... just to clarify a little of the state would have to pay a little bit there but but go ahead quick I\nYes and he will not address issues like erosion or red tide he is slow to put a policy position of 'em even to the public arena because he has to be getting those policy that opposition by the people who are sponsoring him\nSo whatever the differences are between Andrew Gillum Enron dissent is the people of Florida should understand that wrong to hold a lack of the people of Florida and never will be\nOkay a thanks for that or she did mention big sugar we do need to point out Guillen got a tough question last night as well about his ties to the sugar industry um but that said uh lots of opinions shared this morning your final thoughts\nUm my final thoughts um I Want to stress with the caller said briefly and you know she's got a point I mean to say on this was in Congress three terms he didn't really want to be there\nUm that was kind of the things that came out because he ran for Senate mark Rubio got back to ... he got out of the Senate race and in grudgingly ran for reelection the Congress but he wasn't as district much people are in his district said he didn't really bottom constituent issues and\nYou know that's that's what a lot of people are saying a lot of people are saying you sense is hopping from one job to the next and the same as has gotten a lot of money from people out of state um\nGillum has as well to be fair\nYeah I mean we mentioned the beginning of the program and is it just kind of a different kind of thing 'cause what do these people why why does somebody in Chicago's got a new putting five million dollars in savings camping and actually one from ... once we know what Tom style was we don't really know what the saints dinners once and I I think that's the problem\n[noise] [noise] well you didn't hold back on your thoughts on this one uh\nAlways good to have you on the
