coming out of the candidates for Florida governor debate that and more of a head this hour on first can connect [noise]\nAfter the day's news [noise]\nAnd we keep on I have written this article um that was published a few months ago I think after Parkland or in Foley when I asked the provocative question\nIs it time for us to rethink or to think about repealing the second amendment I Know most people would get sticker shock loose thinking listening right but it is it reasonable question to us [noise]\nBut how do you down let's whether it's the second amendment or any amendment to the constitution mhm let's look at the history of that that is not something that Americans have\nBeen amenable to doing particularly that amendment or you know the first amendment and the second amendment or more than any other uh I think Americans will\nDefend to the end they they just see those as bad rock American values whether you agree or not with strong Second Amendment proponents that is such a bone deep value that uh people that care about gun rights\nHold so\nI understand what you're saying but at the same time what do you think about the approaches others have taken to a legislator way to at least reduce the easy flow and availability of guns including illegal guns\nThere are some examples of that without repealing the second amendment some states have experimented with greater regulation of guns and those states have seen the drop in a a a death related to guns um so\nIt is there is a pass to get the public safety and yet preserve the second amendment but if the second amendment in my view at least at the second amendment is he he's a roadblock\nTo reasonable gun regulation\nThen I don't think we should um stop the conversation on it the constitution is not a death wish I remember this after nine eleven when I used to um go around and talk about civil liberties which were being I'm challenged after nine eleven through a variety of\nGovernment overreach measures and I would bring up the constitution and uh I Would have people who are in the conservative side of the political debate would often say well the constitution is not a death wish\nSo well the same argument shows should apply now the constitutional law is not a death wish\nUm and it conservative columnist Brett Stevens in two thousand Seventeen wrote he wrote the same opinion he said that ... at the margins of gun regulation will not end our national nightmare of mass shootings and exceptionally higher rates of gun related that's so\nIt is a signal we were there is no easy path to get to repeal up a constitutional amendment and understand that but it's certainly a reasonable question to ask\nLots of calls on this will take a few of your calls on the gun violence in Jacksonville over the weekend then we're going to move on and talk about another issue uh Jacksonville Ewing ie money for hurricane relief okay I think we have a\nA neighbor on the line of one of the shooting victims good morning or can you give your your name\nI'm not going to give my name but it all we're we're we're on the\nIssue with this I'm about to get 'em\nWant want pitcher where's your number one where they don't want you guys are wearing a roof over our homeland grew into the background\nI'm known to watch somebody to grow on violence that going on there you go on I'm\nOn a perpetrator or you\nKnow and they do go out here and why they go on and knowing that\nDoes not being directed oh wait on program about being um maybe going to walk up and down the street on they know where to go no job you know do I mean\nWhere where do we draw the line where they've gone through the point where we are going to make your shoes and the government\nYeah that they you know what do you drink order\nThings and yeah I Gotcha I Gotcha and thanks for calling I appreciate all of that and so this does bring more pressure on the city the mayor the sheriff most assume campaigned successfully\nOn uh doing a better job than had been done in the past of\nSecuring public safety yet as to as the I'm In the Jacksonville journey era a number of programs are put in place to help young youngsters who didn't have prospects didn't have anything to do after school and most of that money for those budgets got caught\nYes certainly that's that's the challenge and cutting those are necessarily social programs or did not reduce gun violence\nUm so the question then becomes you know not only you have to continue to spend the money on necessarily social programs like Jacksonville journey um but also look at ways in which guns can be regulated\nBent on the Southside high Ben [noise]\nI um I just want to call on your guest's assertion that God has caused by\nLarry estimate is all all of them got married right now cause violence we have a lot more violent quickly that that the causes of gun violence tend to be you know you're so sure that it is\n... ... let me just jump in and say that it is a fact that the U.S is an outlier when it comes to gun violence that that's what I wanted I Know but we also have\nAlso as the war on Iraq is to veil ability of guns of any developed nation in the world we have more guns per person than any country any developed country on earth that is a fact\nAnd absolutely\nIs a fact but because of that the idea that gotten [noise]\nWell I think what he is arguing is that if they were harder for people to get there'd be less gun violence\nGo well they're not about\nWhile they will still be sure sure and and then you\nGot to get what you're also seeing as we're seeing huge rise in stabbing and other violent crime\nYeah but you can't ... with a knife you can kill fifty three people with a gun I get like the guy did say that and find out\nWhat to do with the city of\nIt there but you know there's simply no comparison between the kind of violence or talking about in the u._k. and the kind of carnage that we've seen in this country over the last uh gosh even the last couple of years the whole shooting in Orlando the shooting in Las Vegas the shooting in Parkland\nThere's a mass shooting in this country almost every day and so ...\nAnd I want that I that fact but again the claim that go cause I don't think there's a lot of caused a little while it didn't go after things that are the cause you don't need to solve\nEconomic issues need to solve that the issue is the war on drugs that people weren't fighting the drug trade that would get rid of a lot of guys\nThanks fan I I agree with you um you know getting at the root causes of what I'm causes people to erupt in violence is so important and we've done a terrible job in this country of dealing with that and and we haven't done a good job here in Jacksonville uh let's take a few more calls Scott as downtown Hi Scott\nIs the Mona knew about it with a kind of agree with the previous call it is not really the gun violence and I deal with it all the time well we have is a leadership problems and we\nAh we ah didn't end to now about the battles in this country\nNeed to go all the way back in the way we all be done but my main pulling today here we have a leadership problem here are not only in Jacksonville but what this whole state of salt but mainly and know how old are you have a very\nEvil male and\nA sure why do you think they're evil [noise] where they call the shear key would come out I mean the demand will come out\nAnd say the same thing over and over and I have a multi you see the same thing all when the old and he come out here talking about the previous Mitt brown are not getting the job done it but he can read back and do the same thing ain't that social and civic engaged in a community and I went all the time\nRight thanks got okay this does put more pressure on them\nThe mass shootings as horrible as they are and they as you mentioned the statistics almost one mass shooting per day only a handful of them make national coverage and big splashes of\nGrow and they are that they don't they're not the majority fatal shootings in his ... yeah and also when you already Gail shootings or via handgun via has\nSuicides I'm a spouse or violence um violence from loved ones are simply makes it much more easier to have a kind of violence that by you know but in most circumstances is reversible\n... if you if you cannot violence with a knife you cannot violence with other uh object but there is nothing like violence with a gun\nSpeaking of violence with knives you also want to weigh in about the murder of Washington Post journalist ... ... and the latest on that\n[noise] well I mean this is bizarre it is bizarre and beyond beyond belief but I think Saudi Arabia has received a pass for a long time\nUm I look at this myself as a practicing Muslim who has visited Saudi Arabia\nFor my ... a ... several times um and I and I reflect back on my own experience being there\nUm and after the Jamal ... incident I wrote an op ed I'm that court got quite a quite a bit of a social media stir and the title of the op ed says it's all that it's time to buy some theory beyond\nIts time and I write that as I I did not write it from an American foreign policy perspective\nWhich I Do intend to write a little bit later as I wanted to first this news to kind of subtle and and see where where all of the um chips fall but even based on what we know right now\nGiven Saudi Arabia is complicity complicity in nine eleven given Saudi Arabia is complicity or in the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Yemen\nAnd certainly with this um by the murder of ... I'm a journalist working for America newspaper I think so there will be has crossed the line\nAnd as wild the foreign policy issues will work out in due course that I understand\nThe again the challenges their foreign policy establishment faces constantly trying to balance between our interests and our values\nAnd it does present a challenge on one hand so there may be at ease supplying a vital need for our country but there's oil supply but on the other hand it is engaged in\nGross human rights abuses um for a very very long period of time and we're constantly turned a blind on the other way yeah so the question right now is as ordinary citizens\nAre what can be my response so I looked at my cell phone and said what would be my response at this time and my response at this time would be I Would not go for another pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia\nOr I Do not want to be complicit in another regimes of violence a southern it'd be a mixed about um about nine billion dollars per year I'm On this and we'll pilgrimage and people\nTraveling to mecca and ... right\nYeah that's just during the and we'll put agreements that ... ... and then there is something called the owner of which is the minder pilgrimage minor position was meaning that it is done\nAt other times in the year and it is not as elaborate as the main a hunch pilgrimage and that draws about Nineteen million people and Saudi Arabia is ... is is on target to make about a hundred and fifty million dollars from these ... by the you're twenty twenty six I think\nI'm so this is a significant amount of revenue to a country that my fellow Muslims are supplying\nOf to fulfill their religious obligation and you're saying don't go at least know at least there is at this moment in time if you have to express your outrage at the ongoing situation one way to do it as an ordinary citizen whether the one in the u._s. or any other place in the word he used to withhold that support\nIt is a difficult thing on one hand it's a religious obligation on the other hand you were faced with the religious victim of being just\nAnd standing up for justice which the Koran also exhort believe works too so it is a balancing act and at this moment in time on my argument is that it is better to not spend that money and go to a hundred is better to take the money and help the victims of the Saudi regime in Yemen\nThat would be much better in my view much better way of fulfilling I'm a guards demand divine command than going for a pilgrimage\nYou and ask ... always good to see you thank you thank you medicine well still had the the jaguars bench ... says\nThey see their third straight life but I'm next as Florida's candidates for governor debate a new app helps you connect with political leaders will tell you about that right after this\n\n\n\n\n\nW.

would say is the answer to every single problem that's in a sense what you found when the question is education\nI think that's true clearly millennials have has seen his routine when we ask young people any number of questions about the best way to improve\nPublic education they always circled back to increasing funding for public education so they want to pay teachers more they want to invest in a neighborhood schools and overall they want to give more funding to public education\nAnd one of the features you surveys that you do gleaned data based on the race of the responded and the gender what what did you find in Missouri a difference depending on who was answering\nIn this case it doesn't seem to matter very much overwhelming a young people I don't want to say independent of race and ethnicity but with their races and ethnicities support this idea of increasing funding for education on any number of dimensions\nSo uh this is a pretty consistent finding that seems to kind of extent across race and ethnicity and how would\nYour respondents use the money if there were more money for education\n[noise] well they do a number of different things right there is a clear sense and the findings that young people believe that the most effective way to impact public education is to really those kinds of relationships in the classroom that if given a priority with a limited amount of money\nThe support teachers they want to strengthen teachers' unions\nWhat about views of if it's not exactly public school I'm Talking about private school but also talking about the charter school movement\nYeah it's complicated I guess I Would say in the sense that young people are looking to improve education so they're supporting any number of strategies\nThey are supportive of increasing the number of charter schools they are supportive of a providing vouchers using government funds for in particular low income students but I Want to go back and say when given a list that says here

beach engage at any age and also this week's lights on after school event is all I had this morning on first can connect\nPermits or there has been some controversy about mishandling of that what would you change in terms of the protocol for handling a weapons permits in the state of Florida and the issue of gun regulation and you know more broadly\nYeah I think it's three things I wanted to go in and actually do a full audit what exactly happened\nOr we don't know uh we we have the bits and pieces of information you need ... to go in there and you feel like we had an audit that we are not miss any of the balls that were drop and I want to start the conversation that actually their responsibility to law enforcement\nThat way all the way it is really they really they do the backgrounds that uh and we've all seen that this is the primary over three hundred emails will leave where the n._r._a. ... lead over white and blue and on the regulation of their weapons from it and then licensing\nMoving over to law enforcement and they sort of done right you all ... all the data that that isn't that the theory is is in our state we\nHave a unique opportunity to make a difference and to make sure that the lives of our citizens are not a breath because of politics isn't a partisan issue\nOr this is something that every single citizen and are they just want to have happened if is complete background check all those individuals who are going to get on the light ... of those who are going to get weapons permitting I and I think that this is a call ... happen to protect the citizens to Las Vegas\nYou say it's not a partisan issue but uh when it comes to the second amendment and guns people do fall along sharply partisan lines you're a Democrat and a you're campaigning on a policy of tighter gun regulation\nWhat's your strategy to reach out to voters who this is the issue that they are the most about they they are more conservative voters\nThey voted in every election specifically because they care so much about gun rights and ah the rights that are inherent in the second amendment and they resist any attempt to change what they see is an infringement on those rights\nAnd and we're not and I'm not proposing that at all what I'm saying is that we need to be doing our job uh doing background check is not a partisan issue a you talk to any of the conservative out there that are are listening and they're going to agree that that and making sure that the right people are having the guns in the wrong people don't\nAnd that's some background check and so that's not part is and and when I tell everybody that I'm not I'm I I I myself have a concealed weapons permit I own a gun for self defence purposes so I'm not looking to infringe I met an attorney\nUh so I and you know balance is support the second amendment I saw him doing is saying that we need to deal with that or check\nOn our government makes sure that we're protecting our citizens and that's doing thorough background checks and if that means moving it over to law enforcement uh to do this to make sure that we're doing it properly or then that that's a rational at at the rational basis just to do so\nI'm not infringing upon anybody's rights if you um should be qualified you had a concealed weapons permits or a hunting license then you're going to get one a clear and simple as that\nIf you're just tuning in we're speaking with Nikki freed the Democrat running to replace out of putting them as the state's agriculture commissioner what are your questions for her give us a call at five for nine to nine three seven now uh you've been on this program before Nikki talking about the fact that not only would you be see overseeing agriculture but also\nConsumer services in the state of Florida\nIt's a huge agency and it overseas so many aspects of life\nIn the sunshine state one of the issues that has gotten a lot of attention and criticism is the states do not call solicitation list\nA you know people joke that whichever candidate is perceived as being able to stop the unwanted phone calls might be the winner or whether it's you or your opponent meant called well this is a big issue for Floridians who\nFeel like they're being harassed you've been scammed by a lot of these calls how would you change the way the consumer wing of this agency handles do not call list\nYeah we we all probably have a thirty or forty numbers last on our phone and I feel horrible for those who are are getting these phone calls this is all of us and especially some of our seniors and those who are on a minute by minute plans both harassment absolutely\nAnd what I Would do is first of all you know I as a Fifteen year practical attorney at the taxes as the American taxpayer so most of my legal career I visit comes at as\nPart of what I've been doing for for my career\nAs a part of it and make sure that we are responsive\nYeah right now I've been hearing stories all across the state that when somebody calls and you the commissioner's office to report a number I there was no one on the other line they leave messages and the gal getting any return phone calls the want us to beef up ...\nUh to be looking into investigating needs to actually have somebody on the other line we taking down the east and it's beefing up our security and our technology ah you know we know that you know there's people out there that are brought into our consumers\nUm are are smart we need to be smarter we need to make sure that we have some of the best technology and that we're going in and actually making a difference and then prosecuting these individuals and these companies um once we get a name\nAnd we start prosecuting them and holding them accountable or there will be a ripple effect the costs are said\nOkay let's go to a few calls now for Nikki Fried is five four nine to nine three seven Patrice on the north side high Patrice morning\nOr good morning one of those so so great to talk to you again it's been a while yeah um have you on the show\nYes um I wanted to ask 'em as a fried um how would she work in conjunction with a Andrew Gillum and Senator Bill Nelson in order to make her goals for the state of Florida a bear fruit\nYeah thanks for that uh you know Nikki Fried or if you're victorious certainly your campaign platform will have greater chance\nOf success if your fellow Democrats win those races particularly a Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum if he's elected governor rather than if you'd be working with a a governor on dissent is the Republican so what about that\n\nYeah you know I somebody for my entire life uh my dad's Republican my uh my mom is Democrat um I was cold and hot at a very early age or this policy comes through you know come into the center on issues\nAnd it's that's what I've done you know when I spent my time in Tallahassee and passes on great legislation for our foster care kids in public education we had to cross party lines and work together for a good policy and so I Would do that regardless if there was an doing their or von ... is work together it's love with the policy and I have a track record of doing so I have friends on both sides of the aisle\nA incoming speaker and Senate president are often individuals that I've worked a alongside with over the years for for policy purposes\nAnd and that would in pain I'm I'm somebody who has an open door policy like to bring people the table and work through issues and I I'm somebody who doesn't like to play partisan politics I'm somebody who likes to get things done\n[noise] it it would be remarkable if say a we had a democratic governor with some Republican cabinet members or the or vice versa so you when you're raised when you're working with a Republican governor\nUm that could present some interesting challenges a on some of these issues given that the Republican I'm Mr descendants is far more conservative on all of these issues than you or any of the other Democrats running for these these statewide offices is there is there a common ground to be found at the parties are so far apart\nOn all of these issues\nThat there's always on the ground you know I I I Believe I firmly believe that everybody if they're coming in on the left that has this has to do what's best for the state of Florida we may differ on what that looks like but if your heart isn't the right place\nOh we're going to find compromise on and you know and maybe a little bit longer than you know if I had my fellow Democrats on the top and that but I can guarantee you\nUm that there's going to be compromised the hot because we want what's best for the state of Florida and stagnation or is it what's with that and so we're going to work through these issues and but we I have no doubt that regardless of who's in the cabinet we're going to be able to work together\n... on on the north side Sean hello good morning\nThe morning\nOf a I have a question from his Nikki a ... and please let me know if this falls on your own room or score scope of my concern on the north of Jacksonville uh is urban for urban farming\nAnd then another concern of mine is that we are a port city here in Jacksonville\nAnd I was concerned about commodities and export uh to be over to generate some top of gainful employment for uh the citizens in the north quarter of Jacksonville and a few the so under your scope or if you were lucky\nThings for me I don't watch and thank you\nSure I the first part is absolutely the the um urban farming with definitely fall under under my for me\nI talk a lot about you and I've actually has some I round people up as your neck of the woods I always send our now from his office dealing with our foods as across our our country and across our state\nTrying to figure out ways that we can work together with department of agriculture uh your your local communities and really having a community farming are available to kind of start combat need something to do that there's a it was just such an important aspect you know most of our kids\nGo to school and have one or one meal a day and then our walking home and don't have an opportunity to have fresh produce either at home or even on the way 'cause there's no food stores around\nTheir shopping convenience stores and so having that kind of community and relationship and and figuring out new solution um for for gardening and for and the community farms really go after somebody's food deserts that are happening in a lot of our our rural and urban community um so that definitely would fall into my privy and as far as support\nHow much our trade wars are are hurting our agriculture humidity these teams screening on KCRW has been hurting you know and we need to be creating alternative resources at all from the technology across to make sure that they're utilizing their property and not having to sell it at you develop birth because the cost is just too much for them\nRight in St Augustine hey ride the morning just more of the Muslim of all it's doing okay how are you go ahead\nOh it's called an ... out of putting all of the a commission but one of the things that I noticed he was a overload if this person's ... course and not one of the ... the who controls the uh you know during the ...\nAnd the gas prices two dollars here and you go that route a cold is two dollars and this is my question would be who controls the work and we do as a citizen through above those those two about that\nYeah thanks for that you know people are always worried they're getting couched on prices for gas and other commodities you of your agency ... if you win a would oversee that what about that part of the job\nYet so here we over the summer the regularly next door that you know that ... that writes stations are out there and that at the skimmers that we know they're all brought it emerged\n... and the ... that the gas station when it comes to actually brought to the gas on\nA lot of that profit you can comment on the attorney general's office next door at that are a local gas the owners are not that I can see where the best they during emergency situations like hurricanes I mean we all thought that I mean I some South Florida and I thought the last couple of hurricane cycle that\nThe how much the gas prices you know go through the roof around emergencies so a lot of that ... it's funny at all and I over the that the skimmers that the at the gas pump the safety and they were aspect of it but it's something that we all work on the other because it's again something that affects all of that every single day\nAnd finally a this agency oversees such a vast far flung array of issues in Florida do you think it's too big to unwieldy or the you know consumer and agriculture all into one bucket\nYeah I think that if you have the right either at almost the opposite it can be done\nAnd the next door that our priorities are that straight I it is definitely an enormous to that and I'm In a position that has not the type of attention if necessary um uh I I Do believe that it you know what the right type of leader step the right type of perspective and vision state or it can be accomplished\nMickey fried or running for agriculture commissioner in Florida thanks for being with us\nThank you for having me

world your music [noise]\n[noise]\nWell Jacksonville city leaders recently convened a taskforce or are looking to do that to study ways to reduce the violent crime in the city it's kind of ironic given that the city of Jacksonville already did that over a decade ago during an exhaustive process it was called the Jacksonville journey\nRemember that and one of the findings from that era that they could simply re purpose is a\nCommon sense one after school programs do a lot to help kids stay on track and out of trouble and there are many successful ones doing great work all around town now local organizations will celebrate Twenty years have city funded after school programs\nLater this week during a nationwide event it's called the lights on after school we own ... is chief operating officer at communities in schools of Jacksonville and he's here now Haley on good morning good morning glad to be here\nGood to have you okay so we'll talk about the event in a moment but first let's let's look back a little ways communities in schools started ... after school programs in the city some Twenty years ago and they've been running ever since isn't that right\nThat's correct um Jacksonville was one of twenty cities chosen for twenty first century community service grant\nAnd I'm communities in schools applied to this grand through the school district in back then it was called the Jacksonville children's commission and we won for schools back then was Eugene Butler\nNorthwestern revolted Gilbert and those programs are still in existence today and now communities in schools is up to twenty two after school programs and we're just excited this is an exciting time for me being part of it and looking back Twenty years and seeing where we are now\nWell you must be doing something right if they're still going what makes them so successful\nThe success has been a partnership with the ... county public school system or the city objects and moved to because hope alliance I'm of the city of jak bill Mayer\nOr if in everybody working together for one cause and the one of the key reasons why the program is still going is because of the success we know that after school programs with students who attend regularly do better academically get promoted on a higher level and there's less behavior because they're engaged in great activities after school\nRight keeping kids engaged after the dismissal from school does so much to help them academically it helps them stay out of trouble with the law uh it's it's a really a small investment that has a big payoff\nYes and and it's very helpful to the parents to you were in some of the most challenged neighborhoods and some of the most challenged schools\nAnd many of the parents work two to three jobs and so we're keeping them busy and engaged in safe after school we also provide a smack as well as a hot meal and for middle schools we make sure we bought some home because there are leaving at about seven o'clock can be quite dangerous to be walking through certain neighborhoods\nSo are there is a unique approach to with communities in schools that differs a little bit from some other programs I think it's why it's stood the test of time what's unique about your approach\nWe've we've focused more on workforce development where more academically are focused as well um this particular year we have stem or robotics teams and every one of our programs stem or science technology education\nStem science technology\nEngineering and a half hour and a half step on his bat at exactly\nThat is the wave of the future and what these robotics teams were teaching kids how to build robots and become engineers and there's a shortage of engineers right now so we're very excited about that um we also are doing more trips to businesses to expose kids to different variety of a vocational activities\nNow this program started with a few hundred students and now you served more than five thousand students\nYes and that's just communities in schools kids hope alliance funds over sixty seven programs we have twenty two of them so we're\nReaching a large number of students however there's still thousands of students who can benefit from after school programs\nSure the need is so great and as we've been talking a lot in recent months once again about the gun violence in the high crime rate in the city of Jackson though I think back to the Jacksonville\nJourney era when then Mayor John paint and became so distraught by the gun violence that he convened this massive city wide initiative the Jacksonville\nJourney mhm where a lot of people put a lot of time and effort into looking at an interlocking approach to reducing crime and strengthening families and this was a key part of it after school programs right ... do you think the city could do more in this area\nWhich was that small manipulations to the country's voting laws to state voting laws could make a very big difference in close elections and could benefit the Republican Party so we saw the same kind of efforts and the two dozen for election in Ohio and there were massive lines to vote in democratic areas\nAnd then after two thousand eight when there was a record turnout for President Obama and five million new voters cast a ballot think Republicans realized that if they were able to restrict access to the ballot particularly\nFor democratic constituencies like African Americans Latinos Asian Americans first time voters younger voters\nThey could gain an advantage and they could gain an advantage by changing the voting laws and all of these states they control so I think if you look at what we're seeing now\nYou can date it back to what happened during the two thousand election Florida and then fast forward to twenty ten Republicans took over so many key swing states in order to control the state voting laws all across the country particularly in states that would decide the next president and decide control of Congress\n[noise] another issue I Want to ask you about and I don't know how carefully been covering it there's a lot of concern\nAbout um Russia or other foreign countries hacking into our electoral system or interfering with it through a fake a Twitter account thoughts false information you know um so\nI think twice Republicans this past summer have blocked efforts to increase funding to uh protect our election security against hackers like the rations um what can you tell us about that\nThe Trump Administration and Congress have done almost nothing to make states voting systems more secure and this is clearly ongoing we just saw an indictment last week\nBy the Justice Department that showed that Russians were trying to influence the election through fake Twitter accounts and other things that by the way promoted things like voter ID laws\nAnd raised the specter of widespread voter fraud so the Russian box where basically echoing what Donald Trump and Kris Kobach and others in the Republican Party were saying about voting issues we know in the twenty sixteen election that Russians access to a voter registration list or try to access voter registration less than Twenty one states\nThey got hold of voter data in Illinois and half a million voters which is very alarming and people focus on the potential of voting machines being half then that is possible particularly in Thirteen states that have no paper backups on their electronic voting machines which includes some very important swing states like Pennsylvania in Georgia\nBut they don't even have to have the voting machines themselves\nIf the Russians are others or to get a hold of registration lists like they did in Illinois and if they were able to do it undetected and they were able to delete people's names from the voter registration rolls or change\nOne hyphen in the case of someone in Georgia or were able to change someone's last name and states like voter ID laws that in of itself\nWould create huge chaos when those people showed up at the polls and if we could potentially", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Coast Connect With Melissa Ross", "city":
