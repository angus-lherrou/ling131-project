Jacksonville past racial struggle and our ticket give away later in the hour that in more ahead this hour on first has kinda [noise]\nAfter the day's news [noise]\nWhere did you grow up I grew up in Buffalo New York and and so where did you go to college so I went to undergraduate at uh UNC Ashville and then I went to Vanderbilt and the University of Wisconsin and play basketball all the way through yeah and I also play tennis so it's kind of scholarship to so for years uh basketball for your time is\nAn appreciation for the student population and especially the ones that are struggling to afford to go when really want to go but it it's not\nIt's that simple to many absolutely so we're one of the things that we're doing and we're going to be doing this this spring is is putting more dollars and scholarships and so we just got approval from our board of trustees to two and a half million dollars with the scholarships that we're going to disperse the students in the spring to make college affordable and accessible for them so I fully understand they appreciate the value of scholarships\nYeah I mean I'm at our local state college I'm CJ is working to make college virtually free uh\nFor students I'm so on the one hand the universities here collaborate but on the other hand they are competing for students so how do you navigate that\nSo we're also joined ... you know a CJ and so we're trying to think about pathways for the students so then some students it's a it's important for them to enter into a different system for the first year or two and then they have the opportunity to come to you enough and so it's important for us to begin thinking about\nHow we can partner has increased joined program so I mean think about degrees were doing this with respect engineering right now in terms of a new program with respect to resiliency\nAnd what are your thoughts about the politics of this I'm On the progressive side of the political ... spectrum it's increasingly become a value that college should be free or you or virtually free uh because you need a college degree in today's world the way you used to need a high school degree or what do you think about that\nSo we're we're working to reduce the costs of education a real plus about Florida is worth forty ninth and the country in terms of affordability it's about six that little over six thousand dollars a year to go to college which is\nPretty near free but I Know it's a strange so\nAgain the emphasis on on scholarships is important for us to read and further reduce the costs of education and we're also looking at a lot of textbooks and what can we do to reduce some of the other costs associated with going to school so it's not just the tuition for textbooks are really expensive and so\nWe're working on strategies and an approach is working hard with our libraries to figure out ways to also reduce the costs of education to\nAll right let's go to some calls now for David Samantha key if you're just tuning in we're speaking now with you and ask new president's demand ski this year succeeded John Delaney who was the fifth president of the school it's five for nine to nine three seven give us a call Maria is about Amelia Island Hi Maria good morning\nHi good morning yeah go ahead\nI'm\nI've got a couple of questions I'm a student at un out in the nursing program\nAnd first of all I Would like a camp that you have wonderful faculty and get in there very well supported by the faculty and encouraged and we have every opportunity to eat and thank you for that\nI don't want to speak with you about it they wondered how much attention I can I get here federal student aid program at the college I'm\nComing from the students pointed ill at the very difficult a department and then deliver they tend to give us a last minute flag on our town to the point where\nI sat both in including myself it had to take out by that loan in order to cover the class at the last minute because that they aren't don't indicate but even tell the last minute\nI think it is difficult because the their take on the program that specially mind and that a ...\n... and um and that's why we have ... you're right you want to have and are ... are fun it is unusually difficult and I think it targets a lower income student because that because of the fact that\nYou know most students that I Know are unable to come up with the amount of money to cover the classes and not get them jobs\nAnd the amount of time that we're getting and\nI'm just wondering as what you were going to feel like there's anything you can do in that area I\nSure will thanks for your time and Maria and I appreciate the the positive comments to about her institution and\nYou know what what I'm doing now and there have been doing for the last two months of school started spending more and more in time talking to students not only finding out what they like and why they chose you enough and and the further many the same reasons that you also articulate but also finding out what do we need to improve and so one of the priorities and it is an explosive parties to improve our services\nAnd so how can we better serve our students and not just do a pretty good job at it to be excellent with respect to that so\nYour comment is one that's resonating well and uh you know one that I'm going to work towards making sure it doesn't happen so that people do have an easy transition able to get their financial aid a easy able to register and vote on their classes so I appreciate your comment and will be working on that I promise you\nIt's five for nine to nine three seven Aaron is in Springfield hey Aaron\nGood morning hello how are you glad\nYou mentioned the metric before some of the metric favor certain types of institutions over other and I was wondering if that was going to weigh your direction university going on\nSo unless explain what that is all about sure dating metrics around the state university\nYeah so there's there's ten goals that the that the state gifts and depending on how you do or they give you points and there's a scoring system and if you score a significant number of points then you get extra dollars coming in and so in a minimum if you're in the money it's around ten million dollars and can go up from there [noise]\nYou know I think what the what we're looking at is that the metrics or for us and not against us in some ways when we're looking at the size of our institutions were more flexible we're in a more nimble we can pivot\nThe important parts that we want to work on which are part of the metrics that we all we should be weren't as young as an academic institution no matter where we're at is really about tracking program students is one of the metrics for example\nCertain retention when students come making sure they they stay on or able to say\n... graduation rates are another important metric for about how can we increase that and so we're supposed to be focused on increasing graduation rates and it's about placement making sure students not only have jobs but also in that they have well paying jobs and that's something that we are going to continue to work on and also worked on partnership with Jacksonville so\nThat may be that some institutions are ... more capable of doing certain things immediately but it's one of those that were going to embrace him look at the challenge and say if we do our job really well which is about attracting retaining graduating and placing students\nThat the state comes in and helps us so I appreciate your common there and we're going to be working towards that because I think it's the to the benefit of the institution\nYou want to have and other local schools have beefed up their downtown presence can you bring us up to date on how bad is moving forward for more you and if students to be studying and living downtown\nRight so one of the mission is we have downtown as many of you know is the the smoker which is the art museum and so what we also want to do is continue not only to build that out in terms of what it does for the city but also we can do for our students having more students downtown having the opportunity to learn ... having the opportunity there\nThe other thing that we're doing is also building out to innovation entrepreneurship center downtown it's currently are being remodeled but I think we're hoping to\nBe on board perhaps in the next semester if not in the fall semester for sure\nThat's about educating people in downtown it's also about creating a space where people can think about developing new products new services new technologies and they can work was not only students working with people from the business community but the business community working with students so we're we're we're\nTrying to do our best to also help and be a vital part of the downtown area and it's renovation\nTerry in St Augustine Hi Terry you're on the air\n... how are you okay\nGo ahead\n[laughter] I Am a widow I or I tell my\nCat my colleagues I get my daughter and my granddaughter\nI what am I [laughter]

so we're going to be working to build a stronger culture you know with your help the help of others\nOr we're going to credit community and we are creating community and we do have you know the community implies whereas really is one of everybody feel like they're part of you enough\n[noise] yes uh what she referenced is not unlike what the human rights commission is down here for years circles where you get people talking to each other that don't see eye to eye\nIs that something you think that the school might look at\nSure and we have that opportunity we have one jocks for example which was ... and so it's the dinner series there we often it's coming up and it's about people sitting around through the same title students Stoltz talking through these issues been having those opportunities to be heard and so I'm more than open to any other suggestions that people might have in terms of how can we make it a better place\nI'm sure you're getting them all the time and so we appreciate you taking a little time out to be with us welcome to a town have you been to the beach it by the way you know it's\nAn effort to discuss why my granddaughter came to town and so we're able

voice to the printed word\n[noise]\nWell the north Florida region is growing by leaps and bounds as we all know and in a few years the first coast will have more than two million people so investing in transportation is critical but how to do it by making the right decisions will be very important\nAnd the public needs to have a say so to answer that question than north Florida tea PO transportation planning organization is developing path forward twenty forty five\nThey're going to identify the write programs in projects to meet the mobility needs of everyone in this area through the year twenty forty five now to do that they need all of you out there to fill out a very quick online survey and here's the fun part\nIf you fill out the survey your entered to win a grand prize Jess Sheffield is executive director of north Florida TPS go mourning mourning can just see you too and I'm looking at the website right now it's path forward twenty forty five dot com\nPeople need to go to it read through it and fill out the survey this isn't the first time Tiibea was done this by the way that\nYou know it is not actually it's a federal requirement for us so we do this every five years or developing a a twenty year vision for transportation and the region or this is the process that gives us the opportunity for federal funds to find their way into our community\nAnd you're you are a planning organization of full disclosure you're also an underwriter here to be Jaycee tea but\nWell while most of us are thinking about next week or next month years thinking decades ahead a which can be difficult but you got that you're in the business of figuring out\nWhat's coming down the road and planning for it and figuring out the infrastructure and the transit nodes and transportation notes of this area which is a big job\nYeah it it we're certainly trying um they just a challenge to transportation infrastructure is it takes so long to to do much of it so so we really do need to be thinking about this stuff for early\nUm I I've been at this for twenty six years I I Would suggest that the one we're kicking off now through twenty forty five is probably one of our most challenging because when when we look back traditionally as we are\nProjecting growth in our region and investments that has typically been in a way of widening roads in adding transit very traditional type transportation\nBut with innovation and technology now whether it's automated vehicles down the road or our mobility choices with ... and lifts and other things like that we we are seeing I'm such a rapid change yeah um that is so this creates a real challenge for us\nAnd so you need the public to tell you what they think is important and and what we're what we're talking about here is everything from roads to public transit rail bike pedestrian and new transportation technology like the s driverless cars\nOr Austin on it and I think for us this time I'm as much as we are are doing a twenty year plan which is which is the requirement\nUm because of the innovations that are happening now I'm significant emphasis will be placed in sort of that first ten year window\nBecause it's so hard to protect how technology is going to change so um it is very important that that we get the public's and put 'em in and their desires and their changes sort of in their mentality of how they travel\nThat we we kind of get a feel for how our community is is reacting to these types of changes so that we can hopefully make the the best choices as we lay out these projects because we we're ...\nWell how it you know it'll be ten years in many cases before they happen and I would suggest to those out there you know\nUh eighties is one of those things where it's much easier to care when it's happening tomorrow it is very difficult to think about long term and so it is a challenge to get the public to participate in this type of exercise\nSo so very much encourage folks to think about this in the context of even maybe not yourself but your children and grandchildren\nAnd you will sweetened the deal because if people fill out the survey which only takes a few minutes they are entered into a drawing for a couple of cool grand prize is\nYeah I think we have a Microsoft Surface tablet nine and there's a I think about twenty five hundred dollar gift cards that are out there for folks as well to be placed into a drawing for that so a little something to entice participation um maybe trying to get some levels a greater than we have in the past\nYeah again it's path forward twenty forty five dot com now you tend to think of most people being very very focused on their cars in this area but I'm I don't know people might surprise you I I Would think I I think people more than ever want more public transportation option\nI Do and I think even in the context of public transportation just mobility choice changes I think that that even in larger national surveys we are seeing that shift to a little more\nComfort within their minds of automated vehicles more comfort in their minds with ... and lift type environment\nUm and and so we're seeing that and and as we also contemplate long term we we see e commerce now digital learning remote workers the whole dynamic of how people are working and moving around is different\nAnd it's it's not\nStrange to think that maybe children born today\nUm may never learned to drive a legal when you ... and they might sixteen years from now when we had a rapid progression of of how things\nIn this doesn't mean necessarily that it's from an automated vehicle standpoint it's the mobility choice so the children born today may come into an environment where they're exclusively using other services to come get on\nAnd so why Dr\nVery much the case in some situations and so that's why it's much more challenging this time for us\nI Am I replayed it this week on science friday a sleep sciences

I think that I only strengthens than only solidifies support from that base that really truly believes that I'm Andrew Gillum is a socialist and then he's going to turn Florida and in Venezuela or whenever the talking point is at this point\nAnd I don't know the numbers but when we're talking about turnout they would stand to reason that Democrats have a higher margin for gaining voters\nBut to to come to the polls so really what you're seeing here is dissent is and and the Republicans going hard after their base because those are the folks they need to turn out in in in ... when this race\nLet's go to your calls now as we talk about the governor's race here on the friday media roundtable both Ron ...

of Florida when this answers as saying where we have now is working without pulling down to money from the federal government for points\nAnd then from the Republican side the ideas we can't pull down the Medicaid money because the feds would pay Ninety percent but Florida would sell them for say ten percent we can't afford that they're at the Republican arguments\nRight in to say this is also pushing the the whole you know how much our taxes going to go up to support this and other things and and that's a that's a very real concern with a lot of folks\nNow and then yes and um and kill him is proposing raising the corporate tax rate he'd like to see teachers get paid fifty thousand dollars a year or he wants criminal justice reform\nOr he campaign last night about amendment for we'll talk about the ballot amendment sentiment um that would restore voting rights to former felons in the state uh\nOf course to Santa's against that on any issue basically you're talking about two candidates who could not be further apart and you couldn't have a stark contrast which way the state's going to go\nYou know and and they both represent I think you know the um I don't want to see the extremes of their base but around the census is certainly more of a you know a far right conservatism Andrew Gillum is definitely placing himself as the most progressive\nCandidate that we've had you know a serious candidate for governor I'm In and of course you know Gillum supports amendment for I I Believe I'm ... and right now the system with the clemency board is not working I think for most felons\nLet's go to a it's fine for nine to nine three seven let's go to Daryl in St Augustine hey there on the morning [noise]\n... and I'm a registered independent who owns a corporation\nUm ... if I if I stay healthy or I generate a a fifty thousand dollars a year for the government of I have a heart attack on this phone call I become a liability and probably cost the government fifty thousand dollars here it is a\nI don't have a heart attack on this phone call believe\n... you know so I'm going to I Want to vote for Gillum it's only halfway there\nBut you know it's kind of absurd that I spend or give the government all of this money and they can't even you know uh basically changed the oil and my heart or anything else I got to want to pay more for it so I'm going to vote for ... and I'm a registered independent self that al ...\nYou know that's the way it is and I have a corporation which probably will pay more taxes for\nWell Daryl\nI like your turn of phrase or make sure you don't need to change the oil in your heart to make sure you don't wait too long between oil changes right by what they only scientifically last forever yeah Daryl thanks very interesting are you getting this very unscientific feedback from our listeners\nAnd one of the things that may be going on is people have so many residents and citizens of Florida have seen with is like not to have\nOur Medicaid expansion in their life in the economic impact is having on the state of Florida are with people on the road who don't have health care and this may be a way to the civil that score at least try something different if they if they believe that this was an option\nJimmy treats the show it's wrong to paint Gillum as a as a socialist he was a delegate for Hillary Clinton and on her VP shortlist descendants can't support his rhetoric with the fact John Bachmann\nWill just say I'll be watching over the next couple of weeks and then of course on on Tuesday November six is is turnout you know we you they just started early voting a ... in Georgia\nOr I think it was for the yesterday it was early in the interest rate is very similar to this one to be totally honest and so I I Believe\nAnd they had people lined up for hours in in in places like Cobb County which has historically a very conservative a district area for for the suburb of Atlanta yeah and so um and that's just one spot and you know David blinds everywhere and so\nIs it you know ... mid term elections not a presidential election and\nYou know we're going to a turnout is going to be we keep hammering that and it seems very basic people at home will probably be scratching and has like why is he talking about this job [laughter] this is this is the real this is what's going to be the telltale sign here for\nThe vote by mail or participation has been running in favor of Republicans as usual yeah yeah but that's bad news for Democrats as they need to get that vote by mail number up in order for two to four to resonate with the turnout because once they get behind the block by mail that typically flip\nSide they're going to have the for the first time voting or places on college campuses\nRound San is is pushing a private more privatization measures more school choice measures more vouchers making more funds available for parents to have more school choice so it's what you would expect from these two\nYeah yeah I think you hit it right on the now they're um you know also with Rhonda Santas um he he's certainly going to follow the the trendy party line right now and that is more charter schools are again more school choice Andrew Gillum and ah it's actually what you just said [laughter]\nWas differences\nThat we're we already know what choice does where we're at now we already have school choice we but we haven't done is looked at paying teachers what they deserve\nAnd that's what drew them seems to be proposing in Boulder was going to have to decide if they want to know or drift ... would you put your situation the way you're proposing and feedback soaps work that's one of the one of the things that can help with solving our education problem\nWe I mean I think that wherever you fall politically people do agree that our educational system is not\nSatisfying the majority of voters a but it wasn't so maddening is the the extreme contentiousness and the total disagreement about what to do about that and the deadlock just does not seem the logjam has not broken yet in this state or anywhere\nIn the country money involved and money involved yeah for\nYeah and I think it's very easy to for everybody to recognize that are K. through twelve our even our even our public university systems are wildly underfunded um but how you know you prioritize those dollars both of these candidates offer a completely different view on that and\nThat is right now if you're just tuning in as her friday media round table as we welcome John Bachmann of action news David cutting of the daily record and real talk host Charles Craig to studio five\nTo talk about the biggest stories of the week the number to join us five for nine to nine three seven now speaking of sports and football\nWe learned this week the Jacksonville Landing might be left out of the party when Florida Georgia comes to town next weekend of course the landing has been the spot to go to for decades when the party ready fans roll into Jacksonville for the big game but this year they might have to go somewhere else\nThe landing in the city are locked in a bitter legal fight and the city is not yet issued a special events permit for concerts at the landing during game weekend the big game is coming up next weekend on October twenty seventh\nA lot of people may be left to just wander the streets of Jacksonville uh they can come in here and have a drink\n[laughter] that'd be fine [laughter] [laughter] well you know\nThe the army's city of around this building in a few days ago and we're we're guy to welcoming them every year and where they'll go this year is anybody's guess you know ... and I understand\nYou know the city is wrapped up for those who aren't aware of the city is wrapped up and to lawsuits with the owners of the landing slamming enterprises and ah this is another tactic in that lawsuit I'm saying that you know we're no longer going to since they of since the city in cities view that effected them\nUm they're no longer issuing special event permits but the thing is that they've never required landing to have specials on purpose permits for these type of event it's technically city property I'm\n... and I don't know how productive this is\n... a few niches yeah Mm new absolutely high in the city\nYeah I mean they can wrap it around whatever dressing language they want to talk about safety or you know the the terrible events that happened earlier this year the landing but the reality is this is a tactic it as a pressure point that they know that you know they can push\n... dead and may be one of those situations where\nThere's just want to get their attention as things move on you know the the last move forward\nBut I have a few hundred or so it was going to happen at the land and you know they're going to be some type of entertainment going on this won't stop the show because mhm that something is always going on at the landing whether it matters you know the strength French and by the city or or for profit event something's going to go on out there and then and I don't think is going to stop the party\nOr are they did announce costs when does performing a dailies place after the game so that it was it out because\nOf that yeah they're trying to pull all the ... over this way yeah it's you know you\nSee like what are all the shots of right when the when the TV cameras are on for the game right in the landing it's the party the night before that he is packed it the landing in at you you see to John's point that the city is trying to move that party\nOver to families place they hold beautiful facility they built over there we'll see what happens with that and Jay is in the news again this week nine candidates have interviewed to Jacksonville utilities next CEO\nMeanwhile last week Moody's downgraded J. E. A. and the city of Jacksonville debt obligations so unwelcome eyes on J e a a lot of scrutiny and by the way I'm I'm getting a lot of feedback from listeners saying that the process for picking the next CEO has not been transparent enough\nTo the public so they've had um one on one interviews with uh the board of directors individually um and they will continue through I Believe the end of the month and then\nNext month they will have public interviews I Believe with these candidates or you can come and you know it's open to the public I Believe the live stream that as well um and there's a lot of qualified candidates on this list I mean these are\nYou know executives at large you know utility companies people have had a lotta years of experience and errands on\nYeah errands on is the interim CEO Mayer curries hand picked guy when he was appointed interim CEO a over what many so I was more qualified executive within the utility Melissa day there was criticism that he really wasn't didn't have the skill set to lead the company\nWill he be chosen by the board is the permanent CEO is the big question\nYeah and what are people I talked to the community to say that they would like to see I mean for to make it look legitimate for Amazon gift job maybe he can keep a position and there are some places\nBut maybe you shouldn't get the job and that will make it look like all of this has been butchered I'm an old alone I mean do you can move forward because this is going to be one of those things that go forward people aren't going to forget\nAbout all of the information that came out almost this time last year regarding a potential fail and all of that and that is going to live with the mayor because Arizona guy\nYou know fair or unfair is going to live with them if there's if there's guide your\nTable and couldn't this whole thing um be fodder for potential challenger to mayor Cory that at all and broke Leo with Jay\nIt it could it could but right now who who is it and and I mean there are a couple of names that easily come to the surface but in the in the the reality I don't I don't think so\nI don't doubt it will be there'll be a challenge I just don't know how how's think south viable now than there were commercials or wherever\nBefore you know frame of the day they were being sold and the mayor was behind it so I Can't imagine they're whoever runs against a mirror going over this issue grow without trying to use it as a campaign issue\nBut now now one thing is also happened since this board meeting right so Moody's announced that they were going to do this down ...
