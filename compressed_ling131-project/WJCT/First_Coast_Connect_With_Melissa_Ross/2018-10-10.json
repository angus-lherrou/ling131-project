plugged in as we interview the most compelling newsmakers of the first coast [noise]\nComing up this morning we speak with congressional candidate jets Belmont than later today is the deadline to register to vote in Florida check your status no your rights will have more of that and more coming up this morning on first 'cause connect [noise]\nSo you're getting a lot of small dollar donations are\nCount your opponent John rather for it had more than three hundred thousand on hand so it's an uphill money battle um\nWe ... we feel like we've done everything to date that we have wanted to do a financially we don't feel that the finances hold our campaign back or if we needed more money we would be more aggressive about going out\nWhat we have is a limited media market here in Jacksonville with or even though it's a top fifty media market a television wise it's very inexpensive to advertise here and we're able to get our message out a release were targeted Facebook ads which is where we think people are and through the grass roots of canvassing and rallies et cetera\nLet's talk about a year positions sure you're a Democrat your opponents are Republican or if he were elected to the fourth district in Florida what would be your biggest priorities for this district\nSure will something about the district\nAnd we are at a crucial point in the first coast a we have essentially allowed developers to run our planning a and we had a skyscraper quite frankly that flooded and the last tropical storm\nAnd we have a congressman congressional delegation that have done nothing to address the resiliency for our downtown we have in the fourth district which just to to find it for people out there who might not have an encyclopedic knowledge of a congressional districts the fourth district is Nassau County\nHalf of Duvall county and almost Ninety percent of St Johns county so it runs from the Georgia border down to St Johns county pass the APA theater seven hundred and thirty five thousand people a number of military bases suburban sprawl or urban hipster neighborhoods of the oldest city in America\nA and farms\nSo it's incredibly economically diverse district\nOr we need to have a congressman and congressional delegation that has a vision for the future of Jacksonville John rather for disability opportunity to to set forth a vision for Jacksonville and he hasn't set one fourth and that's where this campaign is is moving forward we're setting forth a vision for this district\nYou know every time it rains the business district in front and Dina San Marco St Augustine flood parking spaces flood a businesses have sandbags on their front steps every time there's a thunderstorm\nSomebody in the fourth district comes home to find the clock on their microwave is flashing 'cause a power it's gone out so how do we preserve the great quality of life that we have here than most people have relocated here for and that's by keeping our taxes low\nAnd attracting businesses here what sales pitch do we have as a city in a region if our sales pitches move your business here the power goes out when it rains a and our city's flood\nSo we feel that putting forward it good vision of a ... of for business and for lifestyle is what makes our campaign different than John Rutherford\nHigh for nine to nine three seven to connect with ... he is running for Congress against incumbent Congressman John rather for give us a call\nOkay so yeah locally in this area there has not been much political will to aggressively respond to the threats posed by sea level rise and more extreme weather events certainly I Would dress that uh\nWell it's it's really something that that\nWe're trying to press down on localities\nWe're trying to get individual cities to have a response to what is a global a problem which is the rise of ... and ... and politically where your listeners fall on climate change uh is is it relevant to this I think anybody who's lived here for more than five years knows there's there's less sand on the beach\nThe water is encroaching on us and it is such a massive task that it isn't something that we can expect\nThe city of St Augustine or for Dina beach from ... island or pot of Egypt to tackle on their own with their own budget and in a lot of cases with with citizen or legislators you know people who work day jobs and show up at night to volunteer to be out of planning board so it really requires a federal government uh initiative\nAnd that's where your Congress people have to uh\nTo upon you take their heads out of the sand and admit that the tide is rising and fund resiliency efforts for the whole St john's river watershed\n[noise] what about other issues uh for example the port a job creation I'm In a minute ago you mentioned let's create a more business friendly climate with low taxes surely that honestly sounds more like that led the Republican candidate would say so how ... how would you do that differently\nI think if it goes back to the theme of our campaign which is that there are ways to do more with less and to be efficient and that's what we're about it's about being smart taking a dot com approach to being smarter making smarter decisions in spending your money better I come from a background of lean\nStart ups and that is is creating businesses where you're not funded to the hilt and you have to to be really really really frankly brilliant and I don't see brilliance or in our government right now and that's what we need to add to it you know here in Jacksonville\nThe mayor is exploring\nToning the electric utility\nBecause the congressional district the fourth fifth and sixth or has not brought home round feels remediation money for the shipyards which are contaminated from their days as ... as munitions factories with a with lead and mercury and hard metals\nOr as the mayor is actually exploring pulling off the utility to be able to clean up those brown field because no developers will touch that land are\nThat's why we need a congressional delegation that's working together and try to come up with creative solutions to solve the problems are I think it's telling that that\nCongressman rather for boasts about money he's obtained for deepening the harbor which brings more water into a city that floods than at any efforts that he has made to protect us from flooding\nIf you're just tuning in we're speaking with fourth district congressional candidate Democrat ... he's running against John rather for for Congress\nWe did ask congressman rather referred to joined the show today to debate the issues is office didn't respond so let's go to your calls now for the candidate what are your questions and comments five for nine to nine three seven give us a call Kathy is in downtown Jacksonville high caffeine can morning\nHi thank you I'm a Democrat I just wanted to say I'm it would be really great I think if you could really talk about your you know your contrast with Mr us whether for\nIn both points you know things that really affect people like healthcare minimum wage um water you know you're talking about flooding but just really talk about it in a way that it's not you know you kind of ideas but really you know maybe some small steps that you would take\nThat would really start to improve the discussion I think\nI Would really I really feel that that will touch people and that's what people are looking for answers maybe stating the problem and then your answer to the problem I really feel like that would be a way to get people to\nThe U.S someone who is a problem that's my that's my two cents thank\nYou All right thanks for the call I mean you know or\n... whatever political affiliation people have I think that's what all voters want to hear right now so so what about that\nSure and not a morning where the where the governor is interrupting the news cast with with the news of a hurricane hitting hitting the Gulf and we've we've certainly taken the first few minutes here to talk about resiliency and flooding and an infrastructure and I know that that puts a lot of people to sleep and it's very important that\nUh we get out to people as Democrats were not an opposition party we're not going to win next month as an opposition party as a party that's against everything we have to win as a party of ideas you know when I see somebody driving down the street who has a a a Trump bumper sticker or Trump pat\nI don't get mad I I get heartbroken that that somebody who thought that a billionaire game show host had more to offer them than our Democratic Party the Democratic party of of Joe Biden and President Obama and Bill Clinton and uh uh Robert Kennedy and FDR\nYou know we're running on this year is good democratic values a\nFrightening thing where ... are you from Medicare for all for example like a ... ed and gotten given a turnout candidate Andrew Gillum let's talk healthcare for sure\nWe'll talking healthcare first thing is is that I'm I'm\nI don't know that um\nThat that we are looking at that situation I think we're looking at that situation as as being afraid to lose the business we have\nAs opposed to really ... where shipping will be in in Twenty years and and preparing for that uh for example nobody anticipated the Trump\nOr terrorists or and cutting down the imports from China so we're we're dredging to fifty fifty five feet so that ships from trying to get into our port and now we're restricting ships from China\nOr I'm Sorry the last question was a last question was a ... a check on Trump and I'm Amazed that we've gotten almost through the end of the second without being asked about\nThe pride I I think a lot of Democrats right now are hoping for Congress to flip to democratic control because they see that they believe that the president needs to be checked and his administration and the only vehicle to do that is through Congress Republicans on the other hand a do not want that to happen\nAnd they are very engaged in keeping\nRepublican control of Congress so ... how much is the presidency factoring into your campaign when you go out and talk about\nThese issues well it's a few ways the first thing is is that most everybody or or or a large majority Republican or Democrat\nOr really distressed by the lack of decorum and the conduct of the president and the way that he is as as demeans the office of the presidency um she is acting more like a Bobby Riggs male chauvinist pig\nOr in the last week and he's acting like a leader of the free world uh uh he was left out on on stage and\nAt the un and the port in this thing to to know is that\nAmerica is a the world's policemen that doesn't mean that we can willy nilly bring about regime change any country we feel like it but when we don't lead the world as a as a political and moral authority\nOr other countries step into that void and it's not England and France the country's step in our China and Russia and Iran and we have an obligation to be a world leader and to to be a shining city on the hill a and ... would\nYou support impeachment proceedings against this president if if you were elected to Congress and the Congress let\nA wet I'm elected to Congress and Congress does flip a Ben Ben Robert Mueller presents charges to the Congress Ah yes I Would certainly uh\nDo you believe ... written has committed impeachable offenses\nI Believe that is that his family has committed criminal offenses and certainly his his staffing advisors have a pet pled guilty or as an attorney um\nYou're it's reinforced in you that you're not the judge the jury and the executioner and so you know my attorney or in ... says\nUh don't convict somebody before you've heard the charges from the grand jury a but there's a lot of smoke for they're not to be any fire and I would definitely expected that a Democratic Congress would want to look into what this president has done\nThat go to one more call for Jeff scientists Elizabeth and jak speech Elizabeth you're on the air\nOh yeah I was just going to comment that I didn't mean to eat with open and um you know I I Wonder because you are in a meeting up to the primary but I Can't work court bird and that state um\nHouse re ... around and then anything to do with this\nUpcoming allow any campaign signs yeah just campaign signs and I'm a bank and so I just you know what are your friends about and get on out\nAnd shop and I obviously will start talking about you expect that part everything you're saying I'm just saying wow it doesn't even seem to me on anyone's mind out really\nYeah my yeah can I can address that um I Hope you're ... you're still listening to things one is that a\nRepublican owned businesses don't let Democrats put their signs up\nSo we have a large problem you've looked upon of Egypt for example a when a there's maybe three or four commercial clauses and then you have gated communities that don't allow signs so we're up to the mercy of individual a property owners if do allow us to put democratic signs on there you are on their end up Russia plazas so\nThat's why ... looks like it's a hundred percent read but it's actually a purple town or it's just it's just the effect of of that um the second thing is that you know and I have to tell this story\nUh we've been trying to get press we actually have been going back and forth with the times union Joe fat and uh one of the editors over there and uh she actually sent back where it through that and then the other day for the other week that\nYou know between between now this was September between the end of September November six because of budget cuts we're just not going to have a reporter available to do a story on you that's what your newspaper told the major party nominee for Congress in a year that all anyone can talk about is Congress so\nYou know we recognize that what we've done is we've done out of the box things to get press or one of the things we're doing next week's we're doing a a a unity concert we're putting on a concert the part of your concert hall\nOr we're inviting all the Democratic candidates and anybody wants to learn about us and we have a wonderful country singer who's coming down from Nashville or who heard about us and a volunteer so we're gonna have a concert for for unity next week on Wednesday October seventeenth\nOkay and that's coming out next Wednesday punter concert hall and\nWe appreciate you being here\nSharing a little bit about the campaign as I mentioned at the top of the hour we did invite congressman rather for it and did not hear back from his office so\nJust so much we appreciate your time and thanks for joining it affect you so much it's a thrill to be live from a studio ... [laughter] and much more still ahead later our book club as we look at one of the books in the PBS great American read but up next today's the deadline to register to vote more about that right after this [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nHi I'm mayor Lenny Curry knowing your evacuation zone is critical for your safety and a weather emergency\nVisiting public library to get your two thousand Eighteen hurricane preparedness guy [noise]\nStay informed with real time updates at ... dot com or download the jacks ready ab to also identify your specific zone and important information\nKeep your radio one eighty nine the designated emergency broadcaster for northeast Florida\nMany places in downtown Jacksonville being considered for demolition or we develop and\nHave had their history last how can we bring you stories back alive while determining the future what each side [noise] W. J. C. to you or national modern cities present the jocks forgotten space Tuesday October twenty third WG ceased to view the evening begins with a reception of six\nFollowed by a panel discussion at six thirty [noise] ours we do with his free about had double ACP dot org slash about sponsored import downtown Memphis and\nWelcome back well today is the deadline to register to vote in the upcoming primary election and if you're registered already make sure to check your registration status before you go to vote\nThat's because the state of Florida has dramatically increased the number of people it is purging from the voter rolls in fact over the last couple of years the perjury in Florida jumped to seven percent of all voters what's\nGoing on here well was more about your voting rights we welcome Deb ... she's a professor at US law school and author of the book\nIt is about you how American government works and how to help fix that debt couples a pleasure thanks for being with us thank you good morning how are you I'm well\nThanks so today is the deadline to register to vote if people don't register by today they're out of luck and it's important not only to register but you check your registration status or wives Florida purging so many more voters from the rolls lately\n[laughter] well my mind reading machine hasn't been working for the last one I haven't actually found anyone to fix it at an affordable price so I Can't\nTell you why [laughter] um I can tell you I I did I didn't graduate school work on that about Fifteen Years ago the voter purges before the two thousand election what I can tell you is there were problems than with\nPeople being mistakenly purged a lot of those uh errors in the system did not seem to get very well corrected and now there are\n... different types of errors [laughter] so so the bottom line is we we can't at this late date a go in and try to get the state to change the system what we can do is be proactive double check or registration follow up take screen shots\nRight or photographs of of whatever registration information comes up on screen we can try\nYeah I ... earlier this summer the Brennan Center released a study examining voter purge data and they found that four million more people have been purged from the rolls over the line between the years twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen a lot of that came because of the Supreme Court ruling that\nI Hope nobody keeps in the kids down anywhere near to one thing for an adult to make a decision I just hope no one made the decision for for a child is er\nI ... have you\nWith President Trump to make any mention of his ongoing conflict with Andrew Gillum a war of words that perhaps when each other just recently justice than arriving items to\nPresident just I don't know ten or Fifteen minutes ago and all we talked about it was making sure we had all the federal resources\nThat went out yesterday some local officials\nWill tell you about what they\nSorry what what is the problem there and why were they ready\nYou know I think uh well I think people are getting ready I'd say you know I think Kevin fast I mean if you look at how fast this thing happened it wasn't like Irma where I don't know how many days we had a long time or win for we have one Florence was ... you know coming for a week\nOr this what happened very quickly and I think we all I mean I think everybody's pushing as hard as they can to get everybody ready every you know I think whether it's state federal local resources everybody's doing you know trying to you know to get everybody ready so\nIn my job is you know what I my job was to do everything I could to get people evacuated help people get ready you know what we're doing here is responded whatever needs anybody has will do everything we can we um [noise] I'm worried about now is\nI Want people to everybody to survive I don't I don't want anybody to lose her life during the storm and then we got to keep everybody save afterwards when we're going to ask you\nWhere are you working for ... and all of a sudden there's nothing else you could do the way what is that why personally as\nWell you pray that everybody listens and you know maybe it'll be less hopefully you know we print something worse than what's going to be a I don't know but but um I think today is is you know making sure that we're ready for the response you\nKnow we have um\nA you know you can see him today you can come in but we have um we got rid of them are recovering response teams are ready to deploy I Know I've talked to utilities I didn't talk to him this morning but I've talked to them yesterday and they're still getting more um utility workers ready um but if you look at\nIf you look at all the resources people are getting ready now the question is going to be is how how bad will be\nWe've got to do a good job with a deploying them but once this happened people have got to use you and me and be cautious you know there's going to be down trees down paralyzed flooding I'm going to have all these issues so survived this storm and then don't do anything foolish\nUm and I know the locals are going to work their tail off to keep people safe we're going to do everything we can uh innocent people out to keep it ... I just I'm praying to God people will be safe\nAt Florida governor Rick Scott's with a a press\nBriefing just a few moments ago actually live from Tallahassee and I'm joined before to public radio emergency network now by meteorologist Jeff Hoffman\nAnd meteorologist Cindy equipped as we continue to monitor this ongoing situation developing situation with a major catastrophic hurricane in hurricane Michael but there's about Ninety miles now south of the Florida Panhandle\nAnd let's talk about the governor's primary statements here um I think it's probably the most summer that I have heard Governor Scott especially in regards to a tropical system in a hurricane Jeff\nYeah Randy ... the big thing he said that everybody kind of I can tell everybody that just went a well timed to evacuate has passed and we can't stress enough the here I Want to offer some some news some some information for you I just tweeted this some photo storms there are things you can do now to protect your life still at home\nSo even though the time to evacuate may have passed\nWhich you can do is make sure you moved to an interior room\nIf you are if you know that you're in a storm zone or storm surge area you can move to the second level or at least be prepared to move to the second level of your home but here's the important thing is is not going to be a storm that if you're in the core of the either you or you know do\nStay in a in a room and it's on the edge of your home move interior room find things to protect your head like a mattress\nIf you have a bike helmet open a bike helmet on\nUm bring all of the things you might need close to you and then interior room think really hard right now about everything you might need over the course of the next six to twelve hours\nBecause if you are stranded or in a in a situation where you need help it may take that long for help to arrive there are so many things you can still do and we're going to walk you through that this morning if you're still in harm's way a from a hurricane Michael\nEight fifty five eastern time seven fifty five central time you're listening to the floor to public radio emergency network I'm ready to ride pure the latest details on hurricane Michael it's a twenty nine point zero north eighty six point three west\nNinety miles southwest of Panama City Ninety miles west southwest of Appalachia cola\nMaximum sustained winds are one hundred and forty five miles per hour that's up in the overnight hours are moving to the north about twelve or Thirteen miles per hour and our current central pressure uh is down to nine hundred and thirty three metal bars and Cindy the you know the really important thing from the overnight hours as\nThis situation has changed and not for the better\nKnow him as a hurricane has been moving northward\nAnd we've been seeing those wind speeds increasing because turns been deepening what's happened is as Mitt into very very warm Gulf water eighty five degree temperatures but another thing that we have not seen happen yet Randy is it is still heading north it is not made that north northeast Philly curves so\nRight now that is shifting the landfall path just a little bit more to the west\nAnd so places like Panama City which was expecting to see the landfall maybe just the ... or east to them\nIs actually going to be more in the brunt of the impact currently sound a little bit higher population area with Panama City and the barrier islands there\nUm but right now we're looking at five hours or so before we start to see the eye wall this storm with the strongest winds and rain coming onshore there right now the hurricane force winds extending out about forty five miles from the center of this storm with a tropical storm force winds that still running\nAbout a hundred and eighty five miles from the Senate storm again that we continue to see the wins picking up as we are now getting into that second sort of bans a section of rain so this is pretty solid now and then as we get into the eye wall again that's where the worst of the damage will occur\nAlmost in the entire panhandle is now under or the rain shield uh essentially west of\nIf you would take a line from Madison to Branford and then down to around cedar key anything to the west that are in the panhandle is seeing some sort of rain uh the outer most bans are working their way up the uh the Big Bend area cedar key uh up to Perry and then just to the west of Madison and then to Tallahassee\nThere are cells and there are very very heavy rain and gusty winds and then you have another band of rain as we move closer to the center of the storm\nThat extends from west of Tallahassee around blunt town down to care rebel and then out into the Gulf\nOr Appalachia cola is in between a second and third band and so this is what we're going to have over the next probably six or seven hours as the storm makes its way\nTowards the coast Panama City right now to the north of Panama City we're seeing an area very very heavy rainfall otherwise it's it's moderate rain and very high winds Appalachian coal the same thing with moderate rain and the ever increasing wins and that's going to be the situation\nAh as we work our way towards early afternoon Jeff what right now are we looking at in terms of ...\nAnd you are listening to W.

notice you pray over me and you know kind of semi on and she said before you go on this next trip\nAnd want you to do something I Want you to get your fancy little car won't you to drive to the north side of town for a week I'm going to match you up with somebody\nAnd then I Want you to come back and tell me why going to some other country is more important than staying here in our community\nAnd I really didn't understand the deaths of what she was challenging me to do but I did a got a minute have a wonderful guy former NFL football player to being a part of Jackson I got to tell you I'm ashamed to say I've never been\nA but we took a week and a half\nAnd also after you know kind of got in and saw the um the tale of two cities so to speak um I was moved I mean I I was embarrassed um I was touched um it's so many ways but I realized when I was coming back then I Lived in my own city for\nA long time I worked in corporate America for Twenty years that I had blinders on\nAnd so it really shook me and I actually at the time I was only ... like everybody here was involved on boards so I got a little bit of a taste of it but I was always able to check off that box\nAnd feel like I'd done part of what I needed to do in the community and the reality of it was I wasn't engaged I had no idea what was happening and so I thought it was going to take a six month sabbatical and then uh you know Twenty years later [laughter]\n... right yeah so that's how I got in yeah so now you're really engaged in neighborhoods that as you said before you weren't as aware of 'em and all of you are engaged in a new way and as we continue talking with\nTim ... is president of Jay you Aaron handy Oceana Dave Jess around with the Alzheimer's Association and Kevin gave operation knew how\nHere's

yeah he was a great contributor\nThat isn't that something I Love you kind of I think it's why your ears so coveted in the nonprofit world you just apply\nAs a business mindset in a sense to challenges in the nonprofit world I mean there are two very different cultures that some a lot of skills transfer\nYou know I think that um a lot of the nonprofit world is moving toward a for profit kind of execution I mentality\nAnd as I you know meet my new peers and and become more exposed to a large national nonprofit like Alzheimer's so ... there's no question that it's done in a very professional way um I think we'll we'll bring to the table is just a little bit different perspective\nUm maybe just a way to\nKind of take the traditional ways of of approaching a nonprofit and then trying to expand it or ... or tests the boundaries or to become more a\nMore productive Aaron\nI I completely agree with Dave and when people ask me um ... what does your background are you marine scientist are you a biologist I Know I'm a sales and marketing person and not just those have been the greatest skills that I brought to the ocean conservation work is really selling to people the
