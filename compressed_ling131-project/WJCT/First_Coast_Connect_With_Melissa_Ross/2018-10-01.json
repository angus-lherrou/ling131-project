I'm\nSure they rank you so much for that was going to she took the words right out of my mouth thanks Kathy\nGreat a great question um van is certainly something that's high on my priority list um our share with you I actually survey waters about ten years ago um was here for a very very short amount of time\nUm but I sat down with some some local leaders already and shared that\nTen years ago I came to the campus in in ten years later now I'm there haven't been there about eight weeks and as I look around that can you wrote court or not much has changed yeah um and so\nWe know that there needs to be very significant in central investment in in in order to college and the surrounding community beer so goes it would waters in that community so goes the community\nI Will say that we are excited and and and very pleased with the support that our mayor and city council um has recently gifted the institution about nine million dollars to support a new stadium I'm about ... also serve as a health and wellness\nI'm kind of track facility for the citizens in the community there I'm In addition to that um the city as gifted the institution about four point five million dollars and made an investment in one of our largest resident facility so that's a great start we're excited about that but there is certainly much much more work left to be done I can share\nBack from a recruitment a standpoint from a retention standpoint we need in a more of an investment from the business community and from the city\nI'm to be able to provide the kinds of services that again as I talked about earlier millennial impulse million you'll students are looking for we need a drug store in that community when your grocery shopping in that community we live in a food desert there and write and many of the citizens that are that are properly\nOn that in that north Jacksonville kings record or or with out very very central services and so it's a real challenge for us I Will share with you when we open school back\nIn August I had students and parents that came to the institution silencing and and I had\nTo cringe to say this but it's just the truth became looked around the community got back in the car and left 'em because they said I just I just don't feel comfortable I'm leaving my my son or daughter here and that's something that um it's\nA sobering withhold them out of school altogether and they had planned declined\nTo campus to enroll their students um and then looked around the community there's again no grocery no no no no no real eateries it it just is not conducive for the kinds\nOf experiences that they're that young folks and parents warmth for um their their sons or daughters and so we do all that we can at the college to be able to provide a safe or an conducive environment it's going to support their learning but we need more partnership\nFrom our business community and from other stakeholders around the city of Jacksonville to partner with us because we're educating\nOur future um and so um if there wasn't an for an award as tall as you'd have to create one because of that institution and in that community are critical to the fore progression of the entire community\nYou know it's interesting that we're having this conversation with you today about the kings record or about northwest Jacksonville on October first twenty Eighteen which marks the fiftieth anniversary of Jacksonville\nConsolidating its city and county governments as a matter of fact there's going to be a big bashed tonight downtown at the Jesse bowl deployment center\nHonoring the big event okay and so\nAs we mark this fifty years of consolidation it's being touted as largely a success because back in the sixties or the idea was to streamline services reduce corruption and craft in the city\nA and Jacksonville was re branded the bold new city in the south when they did this ... the negative side to consolidation was the the institutional racism that was embedded in it basically\n[noise]\nWell come back well this month October is garlicky chi awareness month in the state of Florida that Governor made that proclamation just the other
