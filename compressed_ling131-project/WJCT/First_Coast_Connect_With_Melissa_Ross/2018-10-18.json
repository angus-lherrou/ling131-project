I'm really long term higher dose opiates prescribed only four intractable pain probably cancer pain when I started practicing that was the case we did not give a long acting morphine to someone recovering from say knee surgery\nSo when these medications came out\nThey were not intended to be just for cancer patients the marketing went to general practitioners to surgeons too I'm pretty much every physician and unfortunately and I think all of us are aware of the it was initially marketed as being not addictive\nRight um or or very with ocean it enables cities including Jacksonville are suing pharmaceutical companies for that uh allegedly deceptive advertising exactly\nAnd so what we saw were these high risk very addictive opiates\nBeing given to people that were having young people having their wisdom teeth out um people recovering from knee surgery people who had chronic back pain um people who had headaches\nAnd without understanding the addiction potential um you know like I said physical addiction people can have physical withdrawal symptoms after taking the medication pretend to fourteen days\nThat happened to me in college um I was given Cody after I had my wisdom teeth pulled because they had they were impacted and they had to really yank 'em out but uh over the Christmas break my freshman year sophomore year in college\nThey gave me a few weeks worth of coding and it it did create this feeling of total euphoria and I was lucky only in the sense that\nWhen the pills ran out I went back to school\nAnd just never really thought about it again and I I didn't seek out more of it I wouldn't have known how to do that anyway but but I was just lucky in that I didn't I don't have an addictive personality right I guess my brain chemistry didn't crave it so much that I needed more of it\nAnd that's and that that's the other thing I was hoping you could talk about\nPeople are not ah to be blamed for having a susceptibility to this addiction\nAbsolutely not absolutely not this is a chemical process that takes place in the brain and addiction is actually roped into a part of the brain called the mid brain um that is beyond our conscious control um and it's meant to be that way from an evolutionary standpoint\nUm and I can speak to more of that if you'd like me too but what happens really is below ... below the level of conscious control is where addiction takes place and the brain begins to interpret that substance is necessary for survival so the majority of people um you have\nA that susceptibility just because of the highly addictive potential of the medication\nSo someone who may not have a family history um that enjoys the euphoria or feels better taking pain medication not just for physical pain but for some type of mental or psychic pain I'm it becomes a coping skill as what happens and it becomes a coping skill without a\nLot of awareness and the beginning mhm\nAnd if you're just tuning in Lakeview health has partnered up with the ... in a campaign here in Jacksonville a city that has been ravaged by the opioid crisis\nThe campaign is to encourage family members who have a loved one using prescription opioids to keep ... on hand we're going to keep telling you how that can be done but right now let's take your calls five for nine to nine three seven check at the beach is hello check\nOur guys [noise]\nUm I carry on with me I just keep it in there and I wear it put it on in the morning and night and it's not bad at all on the sentinel is a member of the twenty seven o'clock it was a musician\nAnd he was he was a great kid had some issues but I mean I was a great kid um I I notice so sorry\n[laughter] [noise] excuse me [noise] I [noise] I Know I noticed like I don't [noise] ...

institutions and to tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy does this make sense to you or are Americans over estimating the power of tech and big finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified results they crossed all the demographic lines of his mail it was female it was Republican or democratic or the people that Edison point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent wasn't majority but sixty percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to the sort of\nThe mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies then we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders has pressed Amazon to

influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm\nFederal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole at the big summit in Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and how they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it\nTech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concerns seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so\nIt is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans concerned nevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about it and they want these platforms to do

scholarship you were the first in your family to go to college right\nWrites I'm a first generation students so that was my my way to get to college and so it was great to at least be tall and have minimal athletic ability enough to get into college\nWhere did you grow up I grew up in Buffalo New York and and so where'd you go to college so I went to undergraduate at you and see Ashville and then I went to Vanderbilt and a university Wisconsin and play basketball all the way through it also play tennis so it was on a scholarship to so for years the basketball tennis\nSo you have a an appreciation then for the student population and especially the ones that are struggling to afford to go when really want to go but it it's not accessible to many\nAbsolutely so we're one of the things that we're doing and we're going to be doing in the spring is is putting more dollars in scholarships and so we just got approval from our board of trustees to two and a half million dollars with the scholarships that we're going to disperse the students in the spring to make college affordable and accessible for them sort of fully understand the appreciate the value of scholarships\nYeah I mean I'm at our local state college um FSU Jay's working to make college virtually free uh for students I'm so on the one hand the universities here collaborate but on the other and they are competing for students so how do you navigate that\nSo we also have joined ... you know for ... and so we're trying to think about passwords for the students so some students it's a it's important for them to enter into a different system for the first year or two and then they have the opportunity to come to you or not and so it's important for us to begin thinking about\nHow we can partner how concrete joined program so we think about degrees were doing this with respect to engineering right now in terms of a new program with respect to resiliency\nAnd what are your thoughts about the pollen\nOn the progressive side of the political ... spectrum it's increasingly become a value that college should be free or you are virtually free uh because you need a college degree in today's world the way you used to need high school degree or what do you think about that\nSo we're we're working to reduce the costs of education a real plus above Florida is we're forty ninth and the country in terms of affordability it's about six that will over six thousand dollars a year to go to college which is\nPretty near free but I Know it's a strange so\nAgain the emphasis on on scholarships is important for us to read it further reduce the costs of education and we're also looking at a lot of textbooks and what can we do to reduce some of the other costs associated with going to school so it's not just the tuition for textbooks are really expensive and so\nWe're working on strategies and an approach is working hard with our libraries to figure out ways to also reduce the cost of his fusion to\nAll right let's go to some calls now for David Samantha key if you're just tuning in we're speaking now with you and ask new president's demand ski this year succeeded John Delaney who was the fifth president of the school it's five for nine to nine three seven give us a call Maria is about Amelia Island Hi Maria good morning\nHi good morning yeah go ahead\nI'm\nI've got a couple of questions I'm a student at you end up in the nursing program\nAnd first of all I Would like a camp that you have wonderful faculty and get in there very well supported by the faculty and encouraged and we have every opportunity to see if they get to that\nUh the problem I wanted to speak with you about it they wondered how much mention I can I get here federal student aid program at the college because I'm coming from the students pointed ill at the very difficult uh department and then deliver they tend to give us\nA last minute flag on her account to the point where\nA several students including myself have had to take out private loans in order to cover the class at the last minute because the state department don't indicate but even though the last minute\nSo I think it is difficult because these aren't taken like programs especially mind is that a ... ... and um and that's what we have ... you're right you want to have and are ... are fun is unusually difficult\nAnd I think it targets a lower income student because that because of the fact that\nYou know most students that I Know are unable to come up with the amount of money to cover the classes and not get them drop\nIn the amount of time that were given\nUm so I was just wondering as what you were going to feel like there's anything you can do to help in that area I\nSure will thanks for your time and ... and I appreciate the the positive comments to butter institution and\nYou know what what I'm doing now and there have been doing for the last two months of school started spending more and more time talking to students not only finding out what they like and why they chose you enough and in the for the money the same reasons that you all sorts of ways but also finding out what do we need to improve and so what are the priorities and it is an explosive parties improve our services\nAnd so how can we better serve our students and not just do a pretty good job better be excellent with respect to that so\nYour comment is one that's resonating well and uh you know one that I'm going to work towards making sure it doesn't happen so that people do have an easy transition able to get their financial aid easily able to register and turn their classes so I appreciate your comment and will be working on that I promise you\nIt's five for nine to nine three seven Aaron is in Springfield hey Aaron good morning hello how are you glad\nYou mentioned the metric before some of the metric favor certain types of institutions over other and I was wondering if that was going to wait your direction university going on\nSo and let's explain what that is all about sharing data metrics around the state university\nYeah so there's there's ten goals that the that the state gifts and depending on how you do or they give you points and there's a scoring system and if you score a significant number of points than you could actually dollars coming in and so in a minimum if you're in the money it's around ten million dollars are going to go up from there\nYou know I think what the what we're looking at is that the metrics or for us and not against us in some ways when we're looking at the size of our institutions were more flexible we're in a more nimble we can pivot\nThe important parts that we want to work on which are part of the metrics that we all we should be working as an academic institution no matter where we're at is really about trucking program students is one of the metrics for example\nStudent retention ... students come making sure they stay and are able to say\n... graduation rates are another important metric for about how can we increase that and so we're supposed to be focused on increasing graduation rates and it's about placement making sure students not only have jobs and all of a sudden that they have well paying jobs and that's something that we are going to continue to work on and also worked on partnership with Jacksonville so\nThat may be that some institutions are ... more capable of doing certain things immediately but it's one of those that were going to embrace him look at the challenge and say if we do our job really well which is about attracting retaining graduating and placing students\nThat the state comes in and helps us so I appreciate your common there and we're going to be working towards that because I think it's the to the benefit of the institution\nYou went out and other local schools have beeped up their downtown presence can you bring us up to date on how bad is moving forward free more you and if students to be studying and living downtown\nRight so one of the mission is we have downtown as many of you know as the smoke up which is the art museum and so what we also want to do is continue not only to build that out in terms of what it does for the city but also we can do for our students having more students downtown having the opportunity to learn ... having the opportunity there\nThe other thing that we're doing is also building out to innovation entrepreneurship center downtown it's currently being remodeled but I think we're hoping to\nBe on board perhaps in the next semester if not in the fall semester for sure\nBut it's about educating people in downtown it's also about creating a space where people can think about developing new products new services new technologies and they can work was not only students working with people from the business community but the business community working with students so we're we're we're\nTrying to do our best to also help and be a vital part of the downtown area and it's renovation\nTerry in St Augustine Hi Terry you're on the air\n... how are you okay\nGo ahead\nI Am a widow and I or I might\nHave my daughter goes to college I get my daughter and my granddaughter I what am I [laughter] [noise] I went back to work at your cat that why they might be\nThe one that he had all I've heard that\nThey did not compare her properly or than it's been four here you know I had not at all a pet that I\nThink that why you say that is Teri why why do you say she she's not I\nFirst of all I don't

that they give you for quite a quiet and they're very quiet very already I I had a shape\nThe call Terry thanks for the call okay I'm so not everyone is happy with the programs and the courage to one even if I'm I'm sure you've heard a lot of feedback or both good and bad\nAnd really helping students in helping everyone understand the role that the people play in in the community and a really it's about ... truly is about me and it's about that support and back to the notion of if you're listening a little bit earlier we're talking about respect and so it's respecting people for who they are on what they are all about\nAnd making sure that we do um really come include everybody you know I'm inclusion act because nobody would use the term is as you said but it is really I think about respect and so we're going to be working to build a stronger culture you know with your help the help of others\nOr we're going to credit community and we are creating community and we do have you know the community implies whereas really is one of everybody feel like they're part of you enough\nYes ah what she referenced is not unlike what the human rights commission is down here for years circles where you get people talking to each other that don't see eye to eye up is that something you think that the school might look at\nSure and we have an opportunity we have one jocks for example which was ... and so it's the dinner series there we often it's coming up and it's about people sitting around through the same table students Stoltz talking through these issues being having those opportunities to be heard and so I'm more than open to any other suggestions that people might have in terms of how can we make it a better place\nI'm sure you're getting them all the time and so we appreciate you taking a little time out to be with us welcome to a town have you been to the beach at by the way you know it's\nAn effort to discuss why my granddaughter came to town and so we're able

voice to the printed word\n[noise]\nWell the north Florida region is growing by leaps and bounds as we all know and in a few years the first coast will have more than two million people\nSo investing in transportation is critical but how to do it by making the right decisions will be very important and the public needs to have a say so to answer that question than north Florida tea PO transportation planning organization is developing path forward twenty forty five\nThey're going to identify the write programs in projects to meet the mobility needs of everyone in this area through the year twenty forty five\nNow to do that they need all of you out there to fill out a very quick online survey and here's the fun part\nIf you fill out the survey you enter to win a grand prize Jess Sheffield is executive director of north Florida TPS good morning the morning to see you too and I'm looking at the website right now it's path forward twenty forty five dot com\nPeople need to go to it read through it and fill out the survey this isn't the first time Tiibea was done this by the way that\nYou know it is not actually it's a federal requirement for us so we do this every five years or developing a a twenty year vision for transportation in the region or this is the process that it gives us the opportunity for federal funds to find their way into our community\nAnd you're you are planning organization of full disclosure you're also an underwriter here divvy Jaycee tea but well while most of us are thinking about next week or next month years thinking decades ahead a which can be difficult but you got that you're in the business of figuring out what's coming down the road\nAnd planning for it and figuring out the infrastructure and the transit nodes and transportation notes of this area which is a big job\nYeah ... if we're certainly trying I'm there to challenge to transportation infrastructure is it takes so long to to do much of it so so we really do need to be thinking about this stuff for early\nUm I I've been at this for twenty six years I I Would suggest that the one we're kicking off now through twenty forty five is probably one of our most challenging because\nWhen when we look back traditionally as we are projecting growth in our region and investments that has typically been in a way of widening roads and adding transit very traditional type transportation\nBut with innovation in technology now whether it's automated vehicles down the road or our mobility choices with ... and lives and other things like that we we are seeing I'm such a rapid change yeah um that is so this creates a real challenge for us\nAnd so you need the public to tell you what they think is important and ... and what we're ... what we're talking about here is everything from roads to public transit rail bike pedestrian and new transportation technology like the s driverless cars or Austin\nOn it and I think for us this time I'm as much as we are are doing a twenty year plan which is which is the requirement\nUm because of the innovations that are happening now I'm significant emphasis will be placed in sort of that first ten year window\nBecause it's so hard to predict how technology is going to change so um it is very important that that we get the public's and put 'em in and their desires and their changes sort of in their mentality\nAnd how they travel kind of get a feel for how our community is is reacting to these types of changes so that we can hopefully make the the best choices as we lay out these projects\nBecause we we're preparing projects that will ... it'll be ten years in many cases before they happen and I would suggest to those out there you know\nIt is it is one of those things where is much easier to care when it's happening tomorrow it is very difficult to think about long term and so it is a challenge to get the public to participate in this type of exercise\nSo so very much encourage folks to think about this in the context of even maybe not yourself but your children and your grandchildren\nAnd you will sweetened the deal because if people fill out the survey which only takes a few minutes they are entered into a drawing for a couple of cool grand prize is\nYeah I think we ever Microsoft Surface tablet nine and there's a I think about twenty five hundred dollar gift cards that are out there for folks as well to be placed into a drawing for that so a little something to entice participation um maybe trying to get some levels a greater than we have in the past\nYeah again it's path forward twenty forty five dot com now you tend to think of most people being very very focused on their cars in this area but I'm I don't know people might surprise you I I Would think I I think people more than ever want more public transportation options\nI Do and I think even in the context of public transportation just mobility choice changes I think that\nThat even in larger national surveys we are seeing that shift to a little more\nComfort within their minds of automated vehicles more comfort in their minds with uber and Lyft type environment um and and so we're seeing that\nAnd and as we also contemplate long term we we see e commerce now digital learning remote workers the whole dynamic of how people are working and moving around as different\nAnd it it's it's not strange to think that maybe children born today\nMay never learned to drive a ... sixteen years from now when we had a rapid progression of of how things\nIn this doesn't mean necessarily that it's from an automated vehicle standpoint it's the mobility choice so their children born today may come into an environment where they are exclusively using other services to come get them\nThis is fresh air air at church
