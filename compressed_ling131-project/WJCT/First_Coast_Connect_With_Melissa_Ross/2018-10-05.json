anymore I had this hour on first connected [noise]\nAfter the day's news [noise]\nIn days gone by of intimidation of romanticizing\nThe confederacy and the civil war and actually teaching in our schools that the civil war was not for to maintain slavery um you know the\nTeachers that being taught in the county public schools but it was a it they said was fought\nOver states' rights and that the north invaded the south um but they never talk about states' rights that they wanted to keep well so that they can maintain slavery and so slavery was the reason the civil war was fought as a matter of fact\nThe vice president of the confederacy um who say a ... a infamous speech the cornerstone speech he says basically we are fighting to maintain slavery um\nAnd we are superior to let people and this is a reason for wanting to separate from the United states\nWe're talking about the can down to her happening this Saturday what are your thoughts about the city's Confederate monuments it's five for nine to nine three seven to join us\nGilmore you know when you look at the polling on this it's really remarkable to find out that only about forty percent maybe forty five percent of Americans believe the true history which is that the civil\nOr was mainly fought over slavery a more than half of Americans say that they think it might have been about states' rights are a variety of issues\nAnd so we have a whole country that still doesn't understand the correct history of the civil war and the lingering a emphasis that or a dotting the south and even some northern cities these monuments to the old confederacy\n[noise] right uh you know um [noise]\nA lot of times people say that if these monuments come down to you know people who want to take them down or or try to erase history or nobody goes to having parked in stairs up at the uh the statue of the Confederate soldier and gets a history lesson from that what you put on a pedestal is what you're praising I'm\nI write about history constantly uh you know I'm I have a number of books I have four hundred and fifty stories on my website um my students with FSU J uh\nAre reading the narrative of life for Frederick Douglass and we go over some of these um miss that people a lot of people still believe are about slavery but I'm happy to say you know um people who are Eighteen and Twenty years old find a lot of those and it's a ridiculous and shocking [noise]\nAh I think they are a lot of them certainly can't speak universally but or you know our our well ahead of older people who and and I mean let's face it when you feel emotionally a strongly about something of logic doesn't necessarily come in so I'm\nYou know and and uh I I'm really interested also in talking about how this shift happened in southern culture because the Confederate some cells\nOr as well said you know they said what the civil war was about all the ordinances of secession say you know we want to start this new country the confederacy to\nHang on to slavery as an economic institution and then you have this um what's Melbourne called their long been called the lost cause movement that started earlier in the ... century that starts sentimental I sing it and seeing this about\n[noise] you know um [noise] uh\nThe self funding for its its freedom and you know being a soldier about the the good old days of slavery and so on\nChris Cannon um they're currently doesn't exist the political well on the Jacksonville city council to remove these ... a former city council president in a row Shay\nFloated the idea and then backed away from it when there was a lot of pushback\nAnd so what's your strategy to as you are called to take these down your organization is called take them down jacks given that the political will isn't here at this time\n... ... ... is your goal to just keep raising awareness keep holding events keep educating the public um because this city is not where say Charlottesville, Virginia was when they took down the statue of Robert easily\nAnd that led to violence and the the the death of an activist that was there named Heather higher\nSo the city's not where other cities are when it comes to this issue you're ... it sounds like you're trying to nudge the city to get to where those cities are is that fair to say well\nI mean I Would say I'm more than an edge but um yeah I I Do feel that\nYou know it can get discouraging as a community that was like there to be some sort of um change and transfer of power you know um but I think our strategy is um\nWe are going to continue to be in the streets we are going to continue to educate our community um it it doesn't necessarily rely on the elected officials liking or dislike him but if you go to city council um you will see a card\nThat does name the Confederate monuments in my opinion and in the opinion of many activists in the community that's\nHuge the fact that this is still an ongoing conversation that means that what we have been doing over the past year and a half almost two years in the community to take these Confederate monuments down it's making a difference and we're just going to continue to be out there\nWhat are your questions about the take 'em down tour it's coming on Saturday at one PM in ... park I history chore educating the public about Confederate statues in Jacksonville five for nine to nine three seven give us a call Julie is at the beaches hey Julie good morning\nGood morning thank you so much for taking my call I just wanted to say I remember I I grew up in Oak Park Illinois which is a very close suburb of Chicago it orders Chicago\nAnd I remember being taught that the um the civil war was about states right and I remember ... sixth grade I think\nThe other students and I looked at each other it was um apart with integrating at that time and we'd like to each other and we all fat like it's of course it with slavery we even though we were taught something else which was surprising\nThat so anyone who says it's not it's just common sense the sixth graders could figure that out when our textbook that something else than um than everybody\nKnows I mean it's just his search has denied the reality that's in front of them I so thank you so much ... that that's my comment yeah thank you and you know was\nTied up at the end of World War two uh Germans were forced to reckon with what they've done\nAt the end of apartheid in South Africa that the truth and reconciliation commission forced white South Africans to reckon with what they had done\nAt the end of the civil war we did not have that reckoning um because the thinking at the time was we have to bind to the wounds of this divided nation and so\nFor that reason I'm In particular southerners we're allowed to create a ...\nAn alternative and frankly false narrative a romantic narrative in order to feel better about the past um that reckoning was never ever forced in this country and now a hundred and fifty plus years later activists like this group here are trying to force that reckoning\nAnd so this is a difficult conversation for America and to have as race always is but that's what it seems to me that's what you're trying to do is force the reckoning that we never had at the time\nYes I I mean we've been living with a false narrative now for ever since you know being in the civil war um and it's painful to deal with the truth I'm simplistic way of a child believes in Santa Claus\nAnd then finds out Santa Claus really doesn't exist you can become pretty opposite so if you're looking at\nThe history of the United states and you're wondering why you know why that wasn't a reckoning why there was some truth in reconciliation that's another piece of history that we haven't been told I mean you know there was a decision between the north and south\nAll right to do away with reconstruction and people there were hundreds of elected black officials in the south during reconstruction do we know their names\nDo we know what part they played in um uh getting amendments pass for the ... in the constitution do we understand that they were actually some of them were actually killed to be removed from office do we understand that um\nYou know the ... of slavery and what followed after that there was a few years of a period of eighty years where\nBlack men and women were arrested and put back on plantations so a lot of this was a you know this was based in economics and the northern industrial loose and the southern planters agricultural um society down here they had a packed\nThings like that are happening there was a whole task force on this at city hall as well to try to figure out what Chuck you're saying to put together a walking tour a
