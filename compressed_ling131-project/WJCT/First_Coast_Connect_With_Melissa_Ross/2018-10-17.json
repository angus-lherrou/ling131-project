[noise]\nFor the Florida coast is certainly more vulnerable and more dangerous and that's something we need to be thinking about when when I structured and that communities\n[noise] right and so ... ... let's talk about that Jennifer uh in your world of architecture ... how do you see Florida better preparing in terms of shelter uh for the next storm and what about the the criticism to Florida has come in for that we keep building along the coast\nThough we know these the coastal properties are increasingly vulnerable\n... part of hazard mitigation it's not just looking at building codes but also that man you play any I mean we're building in areas where maybe we should not be building if you have an ocean in front of you and you have in our coastal behind you want the best place to build I mean but I think looking at each of those areas\nCritically critically and\nSee maybe some areas are OK to limit some areas or not and we can't stop promoting and he's planning\nAt what point do you think the rubber will meet the road and the state will\nFinally say okay we know you want to live in this gorgeous setting but it's simply not financially feasible anymore for that to be done I not only that you know you're in the administrator of FEMA the other day Brock Long said the government can't continue picking up the tab for\nAll of this hurricane relief and all of this devastation a at what point well the tax payers of ... a revolt and say\nThis isn't working we can can't keep paying for this\nI mean I really hope it doesn't take another hurricane with destruction\nUp for people to make take action I mean having conversations going to happen now with the\nArchitects insurance companies government officials in order to have a serious conversation about land use in where we need to ... rebuild anymore once they hurricane come through\nLet us know what you think about how we should respond hurricane Michael and the threat of ever stronger storms to call us on the show right now it's five for nine to nine three seven John Upton that serious conversation it's not happening not in Florida anyway I'm not a not at the statewide level\nNot in Tallahassee um the they're they're increasingly is this disconnect between the consensus of scientists and people like you that cover this and the people that are making the policy in in Florida uh what about that\nOr will there is a lot of truth to what you're saying there was a huge disconnect um as you go from local up to the federal government is the latest political aided elected official becoming more and more disconnected from the threat\nBut what you can do is look at the local level\nA sticky all around this country all around this country of pushing the climate action they're taking I'm very ambitious debt to adapt to the changes that are underway there coping with the ... will rise they're grappling with these issues so it ... the the the really critical issues would be\nJust overlook but uh you know kind of just disregarded um you know portrayed as something that I did not serious or\nOr or ... I Believe or something like that when you look at the local level it's very different and will be paid for the for those local leaders that\nThat local energy just that I'm pushing the state has to stop pushing it did they say and you know just kind of communicating\nThe seriousness of this um and that is something that people are worried about the ground level all across this country that it would've and liberal communities I see that people are concerned about climate change but my coat something different and I called global warming or what they level rise but\nPeople are very concerned about this but it's not translating ah in the state or federal latest\nExactly um you know here in Florida Jennifer he's right there are number of mayors and local officials particularly in South Florida where they're really getting hammered with sunny day flooding on a regular basis\nOr they have the southeast Florida regional climate compact that looks at how to mitigate against rising oceans looks at building codes looks at land use planning all of the things that you're talking about David actively started\nPlanning for this but John's right in that ah these are piecemeal local efforts around this state which is the most vulnerable stayed in the country to this problem it's really remarkable\nYes I mean I guess you would think that at this not the state\nLevel someone would step up but\nI don't think they seem is making this hurricane coming through with Michael they've had they see me closer to home how you do\nYou think this one has really hit closer to home\nBecause I think in the past you know they've always seen hurricane coming along the eastern coast and threw it especially the south so maybe\nThis will open um everyone's eyes get all the players in the state across it off the table as opposed to just the grassroots efforts up the in Florida\nOkay and let's go to your calls in the aftermath of hurricane Michael\nWhat are your thoughts about Florida's response whether it comes to building codes sustainability efforts and more\nAnd by the way we had hoped to update every one on the road leaf efforts to the panhandle today but our gas was not able to be with us\nLots of supplies are heading west on I tend from Jacksonville this week to help people in Mexico beach in other communities that have simply been devastated by this storm it's fine for nine to nine three seven and is on the north side Hi and good morning\nGood morning I'm I live on the ... river and um I have just recently had\nTo apply for my flood insurance and which paid and a happy about that but I Know\nThat there is a point in time when every insurance company or to say to me and to anyone who lives on the coast or wherever I you're no longer ensure of all we know that you're going to get hit again [noise] and you know it and we're not going to pay for it anymore and maybe ... say the same thing if they had before [noise]\nUm at some point it just doesn't make sense to to support people who live in a dangerous situation [noise]\nAnd um now you're on the ... river did you get flooded during or after Hurricane Irma\n[noise] uh yes ma'am it came up to seven and a half feet at my house I've I set out to be eight feet above sea level [noise] so I missed it by ...\nBy it flooded under my house and across the street and across the neighbor's yard and down and force for houses\nSo your your house and build sort of off like a ... I\nI moved no but it's up on blocks it's a it's a double wide okay and I did that because I had been\nFlooded a number of times uh when I first moved to this house and I tore it down and put this one up [noise] and I mean up [noise] Joyce is three feet above where the other one was and I still almost got flooded [noise]\nMy gosh well I'm Glad that you weren't and I appreciate your point thanks for that and John up and\nYou know when you talk to actuaries insurance people what they will say privately is different them from what they will say publicly about this but what they will concede privately is that at a certain point Florida's insurance property insurance market is going to\nGo and go into somewhat of a spiral that that a certain point insurers are going to pull back from\nThe coast when ... when do you think that point is going to be\nI Do agree that that's inevitable and it comes down to uh how much money to the insurers are losing\nA lot of insurance that coal and not a is funded by the federal government constantly debate a in a Washington as to the extent to which we should continue a subsidizing using taxpayer money subsidizing this insurance\nAnd when insurance companies and when the federal government that really jak yep those right we're going to start seeing some cut the coast become unaffordable for the communities that are already living there\nThere is a great danger increasing danger of letting the increasing danger of storms with climate change but now we're also or you know looking at the future there's also there's this real rich of that in an affordable increases in insurance rates which could drive people away from their own\nRight yeah in the end that would be more than anything Jennifer I think what what pulls people inland they just wouldn't be able to pay the freight to to live on the coast right and but\nAlso to build along those coastal winds\nI mean that structure that has to go into it to withstand stormed it's also very\nA mechanism for reducing our mission let's go to Chris in Avondale Hi Chris can morning\nGood morning\nA hope I'm not completely off topic here but I just got back\nFrom um the panhandle I was in Tallahassee Mexico beach and in Panama City and first can saw the devastation that happened out there and it's not just the coastal area that was\nFrom I can you can styles and and ... of trees snapped in about Fifteen feet high and it goes from I had all the way down and fifty miles from I tend to Panama City\nAnd in Mexico beach what was interesting is that\nThere would be a house that looked completely on touch\nAnd then write but started the house was lifted off of its\nFrame thrown across the street into a house directly across the street\nI Know so but there's there's so much there's so much other things affect them people right on the coast so I think\nThat you know I think we look in this\nConversation will of people who live like right along the beach warts much further back than\nThat yeah yeah exactly and I so appreciate your Eyewitness Account of that Chris That's Chris in Avondale\nIt's amazing Jennifer when you look at the video coming in from over there uh\nIt looks so random you know one house standing one house one right next to it isn't but a lot of that could be due to win those homes were built\nRight uh some of the older homes the homes before World War two made it the homes were to do after World War two up until about the last ten years did not the homes in the last ten years were built up to a higher code and they are still standing\nRight is that about right yes that would be my assessment from a photo and I know a team's going in there and I'll probably\nSee that too it when they see when the house was built mhm so when it talks about when we talk about increasing building codes I knew that we'd be necessary homes survived no are built to current coast\nOkay yeah sure let's talk now to Hillary ... she lives here in Jacksonville and her mother is actually the mayor of Lynn haven Florida that's a town in the panhandle\nHillary thanks for being here Oh thank you so much for letting me come now your mom is the mayor of a town in the panhandle how badly was it hit the town is estimated could totally decimated\nThere there is um there there is not a resident and the town that has not suffered some damage and the majority catastrophic\nUnbelievable so your mother is trying to just get whatever federal help she can and we're hearing a lot of people over there waiting for FEMA waiting for food and water because the need is so great is that right\nOh it absolutely we um\nI suppose to mom she actually was with me for my daughter's birthday last weekend and on Monday morning she left to drive back into the storm and on Wednesday morning when I woke up in the storm was strengthening from a category three to four to five\nThe uh I sat in ... with with mom and we made a list of essential items and and I said that just ... it's my promise that will be there and um and on a friday morning when our truck went out my husband and two of his friends for the first contact that she had seen\nSince that had oh my goodness so they drove some relief supplies over there the other day and they're going back is that right we\nWe actually where on truck number five now so I'm I'm when when they when they got to tell him hey then and they they were the first\nBottle of water to arrive and I'm One of my husband's friends keys Campbell he he owns a plumbing company here in Jackson Don he\nHe said he had another friend that was willing to drive and other trucks on Saturday morning we met at BJ's on on on Philips highway and loaded another truck with supplies and and it's just been nonstop since then\nSo water food diapers a new in close some people just need everything don't they\nAbsolutely I I spoke to them on last night and and FEMA is is inland have and they're starting to hand out the temporary vouchers they're starting to um to make sure that ... that that water is is beginning to to become very readily accessible\nThe things that we were talking about last night that are still that are still needed\nAnd and it's it's a short list but it's it's chainsaw its oil for the chainsaw that gas for the chain sauce\nOn it and and the thing also as people are are collecting perishable or non perishable food is to think about kids juice Fox's kid friendly food um things that can help the kids\nEstablish normalcy and on and then mom was also talking about the fact that this is such an electronic generation\nDeck of cards a board games things that families can do to try and be able to create some sort of normalcy as a family\nRight that the kids are without their cell phones and laptops right now and all the games they play there so that's a good point too okay so you're sending another caravan over how can people health\nAbsolutely so today and tomorrow Catherine way at the ... is is collecting items it's on Central Park way off of beach boulevard near you and ask she'll be collecting a there'll be collecting items there from nine to five today and from nine to noon tomorrow the Jacksonville\nA country club it's also collecting items they're Jacksonville golfing country club Jacksonville coughing country cannot I and I and so that will be a truck that both of those trucks are going to learn haven\nAnd um we're organizing it'll go out tomorrow night and so Katherine way corporate office on central parkway and the Jacksonville coughing country club I both are collecting items today and tomorrow okay and just to reiterate people need to bring a water\nOr ... the canned food a chainsaw [laughter] what else would you say oil for chain saw was a red gas cans staff can if\nThey don't have to be filled just that um but it allows people to be able to separate and and and conquer more territory and and if I can make the plug for mom\nThink about the kids find 'em as you're collecting the non perishable foods things that kids like juice boxes now and if you're if you're looking to empty out closets if you have poured games decks of cards anything that we can do to be able to to send things to to help take the time\nSo look for the truck in the Jacksonville golf and country club you can go into you don't have to get past the gate that is a gated community but you can drive up to the country club anybody can uh just go in there and drop off what you can and then the address for Kathryn way collections is one one six five three central

research is here to walk us through the numbers hey Larry\nGood morning so Larry we've been tracking the country's economic anxiety since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good\nVery good I Would say it's the lowest level of anxiety that we've gotten any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war\nThis is not really big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them but well behind other things like health care and immigration and so at least as of yet whatever problems or issues that the trade\nStories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickle down to that many individuals such as they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from economists and critics of the president's trade\nPolicy that this is the downside to these tasks that it will raise prices and hurt consumers\nRight but we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important than having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly set protecting us jobs who was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people say they're willing to pay higher prices for goods but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices in by American campaigns things like that they might not actually follow through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to understand the influence of these things were all of a sudden their paycheck isn't going as far as they thought it was before\nAnd we also saw this kind of cause I hierarchy maybe in terms of the priorities people had when it comes to terrorists tell me about that\nRight so we asked what's more important in different pairs and one pair we asked about was what's more important are protecting us industries and jobs or maintaining good relationships with our allies and in this case people were much more likely to say keeping good relationships with our allies is more important than protecting us jobs\nA by comparison people said protecting us jobs was more important than maintaining low costs on on consumer goods but I also emphasize that you have to make sure use focusing on that word allies because that doesn't mean every country that means the ones that we are close to Canada the western Europe et cetera\n[noise] All

I'm really long term high dose opiates prescribed only four intractable pain probably cancer pain when I started practicing that was the case we did not give\nA long acting morphine to someone recovering from say knee surgery\nSo when these medications came out\nThey were not intended to be just for cancer patients the marketing went to general practitioners to surgeons too\nI'm pretty much every physician and unfortunately and I think all of us are aware of this it was initially marketed as being not addictive right before our very\nWith ocean it enables cities including Jacksonville are suing pharmaceutical companies for that or allegedly deceptive advertising\nExactly and so what we saw were these high risk bury 'em addictive opiates\nBeing given to people that were having young people having their wisdom teeth out um people recovering from knee surgery people who had chronic back pain um people who had headaches\nAnd without understanding the addiction potential um you know like I said physical addiction people can have physical withdrawal symptoms after taking the medication pretend to fourteen days\nThat happened to me in college um I was given Kuti after I had my wisdom teeth pulled because they had they were impacted and they had to really yank them out [laughter] but uh over the Christmas break my freshman year sophomore year in college\nThey gave me a few weeks worth of coding and it it did create this feeling of total euphoria ...\nI was lucky only in the sense that\nWhen the pills ran out I went back to school\nAnd just never really thought about it again and I I didn't seek out more of it I wouldn't have known how to do that anyway but but I was just lucky in that I didn't I don't have an addictive personality right I guess my brain chemistry didn't crave it so much that I needed more of it\nAnd that's and that that's the other thing I was hoping you could talk about\nPeople are not ah to be blamed for having a susceptibility to this addiction\nAbsolutely not absolutely not this is a chemical process that takes place in the brain and addiction is actually roped into a part of the brain called the mid brain um that is beyond our conscious control um and it's meant to be that way from an evolutionary standpoint\nUm and I can speak to more of that if you'd like me too but what happens really is below ... below the level of conscious control was where addiction takes place and the brain begins to interpret that substance is necessary for survival so the majority of people um you have\nA that susceptibility just because it's a highly addictive potential of the medication\nSo someone who may not have a family history\nUm that enjoys the euphoria or feels better taking pain medication not just for physical pain but for some type of mental or psychic pain I'm it becomes a coping skill as what happens and it becomes a coping skill without a lot of awareness and the beginning\nMhm and if you're just tuning in Lakeview health has partnered up with the ... in a campaign here in Jacksonville a city that has been ravaged by the opioid crisis\nThe campaign is to encourage family members who have a loved one using

explained her absence by saying\nI think I didn't watch it but I read this morning that she had overdosed isn't that what they charging\nWhat what what it was after she died found yet still in the refrigerator and hit and a cat and she was getting illegal drug he's gone or knee surgery and gotten to it and didn't tell anybody about it she was getting drugs\nIllegally cetera yadda yadda but in her case it would have been and in that you have a family member you ate ... on and you're there on opiates you need you know I and and I just carry it with me I Walk into a classroom at\nA restaurant and there's somebody there 'cause I've been in that situation and I think I Know what it looks like what am I don't I Want to be read so um\nWell God Bless you checked for trying to help others and

with our can that um the perception is is that this is for an addict to have it\nUm uh of course for insured patients the chance of getting treatment as a little higher for uninsured that this is a really difficult subject we do not have\nEnough care in this country to treat addiction\nJay treats the show a study found opioids suppress the immune system slowing healing from injuries what're alternatives for people dealing with\nPain [noise] you know that's a really good question and that's a a source of a quite a bit of research now looking at non opioid a pain relief\nUm surprisingly I'm a you know I ... and we think of you know over the counter take a couple of ibuprofen when you compare that to lure time I'm it actually has the same amount of pain relief\nDa da da da da da and that perception that I'm getting better pain relief\nIf that makes sense so if you compare that and more tap head to head so I'm a a lot of the initiatives are um uh to do prior to surgery\nThings like a nerve blocks um that will carry over after surgery early mobilization\nI'm using these non opiate um prescriptions I'm pain clinics uh now I'm a I work with getting patients office opiates and into other forms of non addictive treatment\nUm a lot of these non addictive treatments for chronic pain um take time and take effort physical therapy mobilization a potentially losing weight I'm meditation um you know a a therapy actually there's pain therapy\nUm these things take effort on on a patient's tired and it takes time whereas popping a pill its immediate\nUm and so you can see why

I was a traditional builder for twenty five years\nAnd saw a need and new was happening in California to build a smart in a in a factory and I know that has a bad connotation when you say manufactured home to thinking of trailers and um but if you look at what they started out west and it spread to Chicago New York\nBut we're designing for the tropics for hurricanes for the moisture the mold mildew the bugs\nAnd there was a neat\nSo after three years of research and development we have produce the first prototype that won the award for the building practice sustainable Florida it's award for
