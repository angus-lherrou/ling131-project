could discriminate against women job applicants a story we covered the other day\nA powerful trade and tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers has just come up with a new ethics certification process it's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hurts\nAnd it's transparent about the assumptions built in John Havens is executive director of this artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for joining us\nMy pleasure to be here this is about what a\nPutting human needs first when it comes to autonomous robots self driving technology\nWasn't in general is sort of an idea of the contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's just new things that\nPeople have to understand her trustworthy so\nFor instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe laundry is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel darn emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and that actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question then some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to actually define them and be aware of them all\nEthics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek background of ethics whereas when we have the entire other side of the planet and the global south\nHas things called Confucian ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that's how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety or trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what I Believe about consensus building globally\nIs to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask\nJohn Havens is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for autonomous and intelligence systems\nVi Tripoli John haven thank you my pleasure\nAlso wrote a book called artificial intelligence that new ethic certification also addresses wider economic effects from New technology and wishes for openness about potential economic winners and losers more of that

bank field Sunday also coming out of the candidates for Florida governor debate that and more ahead this hour on first can connect\nAnd it is not that other countries don't have a gun ownership other countries on gun ownership\nBut at the rate of gun ownership and the unregulated nature of the gun ownership creates public safety and we keep on ... article um that was published a few months ago I think after Parkland or in Foley or what I asked the their prerogative question\nIs it time for us to rethink or think about repealing the second amendment I Know most people would get sticker shock was thinking listening right but it is a reasonable question to us [noise] but\nHow do you now let's whether it's the second amendment or any amendment to the constitution mhm let's look at the history of that that is not something that Americans have typically been amenable to doing particularly that amendment\nOr you know the first amendment and the second amendment a more than any other uh I think Americans will\nDefend to the end they they just see those as a bed rock American values whether you agree or not with strong\nSecond Amendment proponents that is such a bone deep value that uh people that care about gun rights\nHold so\nI understand what you're saying but at the same time what do you think about the approaches others have taken to a legislator way to at least reduce the easy flow and availability of guns including illegal guns there\nExamples of a rebel repeating the second amendment some states of experimented with greater regulation of guns and those those obscene the drop in a ... a death related to gun so um so it is there is a path to go to public safety\nAnd you have to preserve the second amendment but if the second amendment in my view it to the to the second amendment is he he's a roadblock to reasonable gun regulation\nThen I don't think we should um stop the conversation on it the constitution is not a death wish I remember this after nine eleven when I used to um go around and talk about civil liberties which were being I'm challenged after nine eleven through a variety of\nGovernment overreach measures and I would bring up the constitution and uh I Would have people who are in the conservative side of the political debate would often say well the constitution is not a death wish\nSo well the same arguments you should apply no the constitutional there's not a death wish\nUm and it conservative columnist wrote Stevens in two thousand Seventeen wrote a road the same opinion he said that tinkering around the margins of gun regulation will not end our national nightmare of mass shootings and exceptionally higher rates of gun related that's so\nIt is you know we were there is no easy path to get to repeal of a constitutional amendment and understand that but it's certainly a reasonable question to ask\nLots of calls on this will take a few of your calls on the gun violence in Jacksonville over the weekend then we're going to move on and talk about another issue uh Jacksonville Ewing ie money for hurricane relief okay I think we have a\nA neighbor on the line of one of the shooting victims good morning or can you give your your name\nI'm not going to give my name but we're we're we're usually politician\nUh-huh I'm about to get 'em\nWant want pitcher where's your number one we're ... wearing [noise] our own way I grew I did it on the ground\nI'm no longer to watch somebody to grow on that going on but it's not going to\nI'm\nI'm I'm the perpetrator or you\nKnow and they do go out here and watch it on and on the\nCourt does not being directed away from programs um navy boy's woke up and down the street object nowhere to go no job you know I mean\nWhere where do we draw the line where they've gone through the point where we'd outlook on the issues and the government\nYeah that they you know what do you drink your order\nThings and yeah I Gotcha I Gotcha and thanks for calling I appreciate all of that and so this does bring more pressure on the city the mayor the sheriff most assume campaigned successfully on uh doing a better job than had been done in the past of\nSecuring public safety yet as to as the caller pointed out I'm In the Jacksonville journey era a number of programs are put in place to help young youngsters who didn't have prospects didn't have anything to do after school and most of that money for those budgets got caught\nYes certainly that's that's the challenge and cutting those are necessarily social programs or did not reduce gun violence um so the question then becomes you know\nNot only you have to continue to spend that money on necessarily social programs like Jacksonville journey um but also look at ways in which guns can be regulated\nThen on the Southside high Ben [noise]\nHi I'm I just want to call your guest's assertion that God is caused by\nLarry estimate is all all of our guys in America right now cause violence we have a lot more violent than that the causes of gun violence tend to be you know your social issues [noise] [noise]\nWell ... let me just jump in and say that it is a fact that the U.S is an outlier when it comes to gun violence that's what I wanted I Know but we also have also at the world he argues to veil ability of\nGuns of any developed nation in the world we have more guns per person than any country any developed country on earth that is a fact and oh man ...\nIs a fat but because of that the idea that gotten [noise]\nWell I think what he is arguing is that if they were harder for people to get there'd be less gun violence\nA lot about\nBut they still being sure in in the\nSame guy but you're also seeing as we're seeing a huge rise in stabbings and other violent crime\nYeah but you can't tell ... with a knife you can kill fifty three people with a gun I get like the guy did on the house and have it and find out where\nOne to school with him\nBut you know there's simply no comparison between the kind of violence you're talking about in the u._k. and the kind of carnage that we've seen in this country over the last uh gosh even the last couple of years the whole shooting in Orlando the shooting in Las Vegas the shooting in Parkland\nThere was a mass shooting in this country almost every day and so ...\nAnd I was denied that fact but again the claim that God will cause I don't think there's a lot of caused a little while and it didn't go after things that are caused by all you need to solve yeah like if you need to stop all the\nIssues are out of the war on drugs that people were fighting the drug trade that would get rid of a lot of\nThings than I I agree with you um you know getting at the root causes of what I'm causes people to\nErupt in violence is so important and we've done a terrible job in this country of dealing with that and and we haven't done a good job here in Jacksonville uh let's take a few more calls Scott as downtown Hi Scott\n[noise] you know the Mona knew about it with a a kind of like really with the previous call it is not really the gun violence and I deal with it all the time when we have is a leadership problem and we\nUh we are getting into now about the vows in this country we need to go all the way back in the way we all be done\n... but my main pulling today here we have a leadership problem here are not only in ... but what this whole state of salt but mainly and know how old are you have a very evil male and\nA sure why do you think they're evil [noise] where they\nCall the shear key would come out I mean the man will come and say the same thing over and over and I have a multi ... see the same thing all when the old and he come out here talking about the previous ... wow oh not\nGetting the job done it but he comes back and do the same thing and that social and civic engaged in a community and I went all the time\nAll right thanks got okay this does put more pressure on the mayor and the sheriff to deal with this problem um in fact they were tweeting Eric I'm Sorry a sheriff Williams was tweeting last night from Tampa where he went over to support ... Santos he's campaigning for governor or\nAs this was unfolding I'm so this is a certainly politicized in this mid term election cycle in Florida right\nNow it is even more ironic that are on this and this was attacking Andrew Gillum about crime in Tallahassee when he was being supported by Mike Williams and Lenny Curry whose own cities are reeling from gun violence\nLet me ask you followed that here's an email for you from a listener many on the left to think of President Trump as a Hitler like person do we want to eliminate the second amendment in the right to own guns if you think you're going to have to deal with a Hitler it did not work in Europe eighty years ago\nAnd the as you mentioned the statistic is almost one mass shooting per day only a handful of\nThem make national coverage and big splashes of grow and they are that they don't they're not the majority fail shootings in his ... yeah and also majority Gail shootings or via handgun via hat on\nSuicides I'm a spouse or violence um violence from loved ones are simply makes it much more easier\nTo have a kind of violence that by you know an old most circumstances is reversible ... if you if you cannot violence with a knife you cannot violence with other uh object but there is nothing like violence with a gun\nSpeaking of violence with knives you also wanted to weigh in about the murder of Washington Post journalist ... ... and the latest on that\n[noise] well I mean this is bizarre it is bizarre and beyond beyond belief but I think Saudi Arabia has received a pass for a long time [noise]\nUm I look at this myself as a practicing Muslim who has visited Saudi Arabia\nFor my ... a ... several times\nUm and I and I reflect back on my own experience being there um and after ... incident I wrote an op ed I'm that court got quite a quite a bit of a social media stir and the title of the op ed says it's all that it's time to buy some theory beyond\nIts time and I'd write it as I did not write it from an American foreign policy perspective which I Do intend to write a little bit later as I wanted to first this news to kind of subtle and and see where where all of the um chips fall but even based on what we know right now\nGiven Saudi Arabia's complicity complicity in nine eleven given Saudi Arabia's complicity or in the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Yemen and certainly with this um by the murder of junk ... I'm a journalist work working for American newspaper I think so there will be has crossed the line\nAnd as wild the foreign policy issues will work out in due course that I understand\nThe again the challenges their foreign policy establishment faces constantly trying to balance between our interests than our values\nAnd it does present a challenge on one hand so there may be at ease supplying a vital need for our country but there's oil supply but on the other hand it is engaged in gross human rights abuses um for a very very long period of time and we're constantly\nTurned a blind on the other way yeah so the question right now is as ordinary citizens are what can be my response so I looked at my cell phone and said what would be my response at this time and my response at this time would be I Would not go for another pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia\nOr I Do not want to be complicit in another regimes of violence a southern it'd be a mixed about um about nine billion dollars per year I'm On it and we'll pilgrimage and he\nBuilt traveling to mecca and ... right\nYeah that's just during the end will ... hot and then there is there's something called the owner of which is the minder pilgrimage a minor ... meaning that it is done\nAt other times in the year and it is not as elaborate as the main a hunch pilgrimage and that draws about Nineteen million people and Saudi Arabia is ... is is on target to make about a hundred and fifty billion dollars from these political images by the you're twenty twenty six I think\nI'm so this is a significant amount of revenue to a country that my fellow Muslims are supplying of to fulfill their religious obligation\nAnd you're saying dump out\nAt least know at least there is at this moment in time if you have to express your outrage at the ongoing situation one way to do it as an ordinary citizen whether the one in the u._s. or any other place in the word is to withhold that support\nIt is a difficult thing on one hand it's a religious obligation on the other hand you were faced with the religious victim of being just\nAnd standing up for justice which the Koran also exhort believe works too so it is a balancing act and at this moment in time of my argument is that it is better to not spend that money\nAnd go to a hundred is better to take the money and help the victims of the Saudi regime in Yemen\nThat would be much better in my view a much better way of fulfilling I'm a God's demand divine command than going for a pilgrimage\nYou and ask ... always good to see you thank you thank you Melissa well still had the the jaguars bench ...\nSays they see their third straight life but I'm next as Florida's candidates for governor debate a new app helps you connect with political leaders will tell you about that right after this\n\nW J C D readers are here for years with the Florida Times union complete with news management oh there\nAre readers will bring the paper to live to serve those with climate and other physical challenges need our service go online to W.
