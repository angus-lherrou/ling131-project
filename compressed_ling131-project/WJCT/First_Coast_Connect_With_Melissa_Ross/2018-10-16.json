of the first coast\nComing up this morning what are the next steps in the Russia probe we speak with author Greg Miller of the Washington Post about his new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy that and more I had this hour on first cars can act [noise]\nPerception that he's very wary of criticizing bladder ... he denied that she also asked him a about Russian interference in the twenties sixteen election\nHe said that he agreed there was Russian meddling but that he feels China is a bigger threat to the United states I'm just curious to get your thoughts about that interview and what the president said\nI think it's astonishing that here we are two years later we're still asking president of the United states whether he believes Russia interfered in twenty sixteen and he's still a quick ...\nTwo years later he's still not being clear about what the American public refusing to often deflecting right in this case last night he's really pointing fingers in other directions including a China\nBut this is this isn't just you know\nFrustrating inability to hold somebody accountable it's something that really as significant consequences for us as a country because I'm the lesson from from this for Russia at least was man did we achieve a lot of impact for very little investment\nAnd the United states sort of has to remain vulnerable to that when the president refuses to acknowledge it refuses to take any steps\nTo sort of make sure that it doesn't happen again\nWe'll go to your calls in a moment for Pulitzer Prize winning author Greg Miller of the Washington Post his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the Senate version of American democracy in the number to join us five for nine to nine three seven now you call your book The Apprentice this sort of a\nTake on the fact that of course Donald Trump rose to fame with that reality show but you now or implying that he is an apprentice in his role as presidents in his uh ...\nTo ... to ... is that the the implication of the title of the book\nIs I mean it's a little tongue in cheek but I mean you write so to me the title works on a couple of different levels one you're right he just this is the title of the TV show that propelled him to such great fame and the United states\nTo you know the word apprentice sort of means somebody who's sort of getting on the job training and that's what Trump has been as president right he arrived in office having never held public office having never looked at a classified document a little little\nPreparation and needed tons of how to learn on the job and\nAlso this other part of the word apprentice which came to ... and said I'm subservient and this is one of the core kind of odd\nQuestions that just hangs over Trump\nWhat is it what accounts for his surveillance tape of a lot of ... why does he consistently stick to\nThe Kremlin is talking points why can't he never sort of criticized the Russian President or why does he since taking office why has Trump consistently tried to block any policy measure or punitive measure that would displeased the Russian leader\nDo you believe based on your own reporting and what is publicly verifiable\nThat the Russians have some sort of the term is compromise compromising material on President\nYou know I don't know and I don't think anybody perhaps Robert Mueller has an answer to that question I'm\nObviously that with a theory I'm In a surface in something we call the Steele dossier which was a research done by a former British spy who\nWho had sources inside Russia saying that that uh the Kremlin had um images or information about Trump consulting with prostitutes when he went to Moscow and twenty Thirteen for the Miss Universe pageant those allegations have never been proven\nThat could be true they might not be we just don't know but um\nI think that you know the the ... what we're trying to get at here is what explains what could explain the way Trump behaves toward ... and I think it's just a more complicated question\nI think part of it is just sort of deals with the core of Trump's personality is admiration\nFor the kind of leader he thinks that Vladimir ... is his envy of the kind of arrangement that ... has as president of Russia where there is no opposition there is no opposition party there is no justice department that's going to investigate Vladimir ... there's no critical\nThere is no very little a free press in Russia capable of challenging bladder more potent and I mean honestly wouldn't Trump loved to have that identical arrangement here he sort of acts like that all the time\nYou're a a Pulitzer Prize winner at the post ah in part because you've broken a lot of stories related to the Trump administration's ties to Russia ... your story about former national security adviser Michael Flynn was a big one you reveal that Flynn had disgust us sanctions\nWith Russian officials prior to\nPresident Trump's inauguration you recently told NPR that you realized or after you rent a memo written by former FBI Director Jim Comey\nThat when the president or was\nSaying he believed reporters should be put in jail that he was referring to you is that right\n[laughter] that's right yeah uh I didn't learn that until many months later but you know Jim call me when he was FBI Director\nKept detailed memos every time he interacted with President Trump he would go back to his computer and put together a memo I'm taking down notes of what they had talked about because he was so troubled by what he was being asked to do in some cases [noise]\nOne of those memos talks about a conversation that he and Trump had in the oval office after Flynn had been forced out when the FBI was investigating planned and which Trump is asking call me can you see your way clear to letting Flynn go don't pursue this case against him [noise] it's the same conversation\nTrump is trying to say look the real issue here is leaked the real issue here the real crime as what people are saying about me [laughter] uh and he goes on to describe the stories that he was really upset about these are stories that revealed a the contents of his conversations with foreign leaders including the president to Mexico and\nUh he says oh we need to put reporters in jail and he's talking about the stories that I had written he's talking about me he's talking about my sources he's telling me we need to put reporters in jail and call me as a green Columbia saying yeah I Would love to put some heads on bikes here as an example it was a really\nDifficult to [laughter] ah in jarring\nTo read that we'll talk some more about uh your reporting about the firing of Jim Comey from the FBI and other details inside the new book The Apprentice it's Trump Russia and the subversion of American democracy let's go to your calls now for Greg Miller the Washington Post\nFine for nine to nine

Sanders with a democratic administration and local media to Angela\nWe and I looked at a Bill Clinton Obama they try to influence this lady elections which has been going on for ever and to think that a Russian and the Chinese and the and the Israelis are not going to the hacking into our system\nIs like making nobody's going to be happening in your computer I'm surprised that anybody shock this\nYeah things check and I think you're right about that I think the the the question that's hanging out there though is did the Trump campaign coordinate with this effort Greg Miller\n[noise] yeah I think there's something else to I'm a real important distinction to make here the caller is right\nThat there are um United States engages in hacking operations to steal secrets from other countries\nThan many other countries do the same against us all over the world China Iran North Korea it's not just Russia [noise] U.S intelligence agencies did see a Russian penetration of the DNC

thirteenth Seventeen Seventy five\nThat was over the weekend and we're marking the celebration of the Navy's birthday with a unique perspective\nIn any branch of service for women racial minorities algae Beatty troops serving can often be an isolating sometimes frightening experience\nFirst coast author and retired naval surface warfare officer Keith Greene tells his story of navy service and then you buck black officer white navy and he joins us now can morning good morning so I guess you were at a celebration for the navy for the over the weekend is that right\nYes I was I spoke at the chemical on a country club the Jacksonville pin women invited me to be their guest speaker for the month of October and uh I really enjoyed it very gracious\nThe navy found it at the height of our revolution and back in Seventeen Seventy five\nPretty amazing absolutely yeah OK\nAnd of course it was an all white or navy in those days are but as the military became integrated after particularly after World War two uh the services became more diverse but of course the navy like really all of the branches since the military\nHad a well documented history of racism and sell as an African American who served your story is really fascinating beginning with your dad before you\nCame along tell me about\nOne of my father served in Korea he was a paratrooper he joined the army at Seventeen his father died when he was twelve and a VA hospital\nAnd my father joined the navy at Seventeen\nAnd uh I mean yes Seventeen and he wound up a spending about Fifteen sixteen years in the navy he told me when I came in a set I was going to join the navy I'm not going to have the papers for you to join because the Navy's to racist\nAnd I said no that's changed ... the CNN who has said that those days are over there is no black navy there's no white neighborhood there's only one day a took just a couple of years for me to figure out my father did have a bit more insight then I realized\nWhat happened to you after you joined up well\nI went to my first school as a mine men and they'd be mom and I was one of the very few are black young men that came in they got a guarantee day school and I was gung ho I bought the T shirt had the hat you know drink the Kool Aid\nBut once I got into my ... school in Charleston South Carolina I was hitting a pretty quickly with the you know blatant racism or qualified for accelerate advancement of the number two students in my class\nThat changed my grade so that I didn't get the honor roll and then they told me that I couldn't accept the accelerated investment we are with this this was Nineteen Seventy five okay this was a few months before the navy had his first affirmative action plan\nOkay so what how did you react to that well\nI had a I was young and green I didn't know what to do so I went to my reserve unit and when I checked into my reserve unit the personnel when they're at the desk\nLooks up from a record a surprise and says hey you qualify for accelerate advancement day for why didn't you take did you know that I said yes and he said well why don't you take us said well they told me I couldn't get it and he looked at me with this critical look and I knew that I'd been lied to but we had a class it started out with twenty five twenty six students and\nWe only graduated seven is very difficult class uh but they just didn't want me the navy had changed but ah at the ... level you still had some entrenched attitude that were hostile to minorities\nIn your book black officer white navy you write about uh being a black officer as though it was an extra job an extra layer of responsibility ... what do you mean by that\nWhat I mean by that is often times I wouldn't be set up to fail a it was often times I felt like I wasn't getting the support I needed from subordinate superiors or my peers I'll give you one example I was getting ready to deploy for six months cruise to the Persian Gulf\nAnd my very own supply officer wasn't ordering the parts that I needed to get underway I talked to my my other department heads I talked to the XO the captain finally in desperation I had to create this report out of thin air and walked in and gave it to the captain I stayed up all night man one of us fly petty officers and I walked into kept us it's er if\nI don't get these parts visa my twenty five most critical parts of I don't get these parts to ship doesn't apply on time if it doesn't apply on time you're going to have to explain that to somebody because I have explained to you what my problems are he called us ... syrup\nA display house couldn't answer why wasn't ordering parts and everyone else is getting theirs so the end result was splashed got yelled at and get to like the report so much he had made he made all the other department at scrape the same report so I had to teach them how to do it now they're all mad at me because they got out of work to do in a dish and to me so that's the extra job part of it\nYeah yeah and one example having\nTo overcompensate for the the structural racism that was was there at at the time and you know it it does is not a unique story at ... either in the military or in the in the civilian world but in the military when it's like a life or death situation racism gets in the way\nAbsolutely it affects unit cohesion it affects the ability to trust each other and it affects the mission\nOr I'll give you another example I was a tactical action also in the Persian Gulf\nI was responsible for fighting that ship if we entered a minefield if we were attacked by small boat if we had missiles coming in as as a hit the USS dark I gave a chief petty officer in order and he ignored my order and walked out of the room without a complying with the order that I'd given\nWhat I put him on report which is exactly what I was supposed to do his department and the executive office in the captain all tried to get me to push that down which would severely limit my uh authority in that circumstance I needed everyone to do what was supposed to happen\nOr when it was supposed to have in someone's questioning my authority that puts the ship at risk\nHow do you feel the navy is doing today on these issues\nI think the navy or I'm worried that the navy might be going backwards both on the racial issues and also on the the female issues just yesterday or just friday on um\nUm the day before the Navy's birthday the chief of naval operations was chastised by the uh DOD inspector general for failure to properly a handle some sexual harassment sexual assault complaints against officer on his staff\nThe navy has gotten a lot of bad press with bad a ship us so shallow they called it the USS prison chip you can Google that [noise]\nCaptain refused to allow his crew to celebrate black history month he was handing out bread and water like it was candy and also a they knew the navy knew that the morale on the ship was going down consistently every six months they did a climate surveys but the captain finished his tour\nA animal show our who was the first black four star female a animal in the navy she retired uh just last year\nBut a few years before that a rear admiral was relieved because he was disparaging minority officers a particularly minority flag officers and um he said that\nWe don't have this problem in in the aviation navy because we don't let 'em in or we handle it if they get and we'd get rid of him so he was relieved and had to retire but there are other indications that there's there may be some problems in the navy\nAnd on the other hand the me too movement has swept the nation both the civilian and military population so there's a lot of attention being paid not a gender inequality absolutely a which does intersect with racial inequality\nOne of my big concerns right now is that since\nThe year two thousand the navy and a department of defense has refused to release statistics on discrimination in the navy that used to be they published published them Emanuel defense report\nBut under Donald Rumsfeld they stopped doing that it hasn't changed so no one really knows what's happening a lot of attention is being paid to the me too movement but not very much in the Arab discrimination because\nIt's difficult to get the statistics I have to file a freedom of Information Act request to get some of the ... districts are used for my book and I was on the verge of suing the department of defense with help from a non profit because I really needed those numbers and because I worked in that field I knew that they were there and they should be available I've actually got um\nYou did and there in the book I'm so knowing what you know uh having served would you would you do it all again if you had the choice is er and would you encourage young people to sign up and serve in the military today\nI Would encourage I Would encourage anyone to join the military the military was the best decision I ever made the problem I had with that was where the rubber meets the road do you have these uh uh procedures in place but if the individuals that are responsible for doing that are not doing it then the ... the programs are no good but I'd encourage anyone to join the military\nYou still feel the the good outweighs the bad\nOh of course I Love the navy I always have I wouldn't be putting myself out there criticizing the navy if I didn't believe in the organization sometimes you get your best input your best information from the customers who take the time to fill up the survey that's why you offer them things that will entice them to do so\nWell the new book is black officer white navy by Jacksonville zone Ruben Keith Green a thanks for being with us like him around ...

I Believe or something like that when you look at the local level it's very different than what we paid for that for those local later that\nThat local energy just that I'm pushing the state has to stop pushing in today's day and you know just kind of communicating\nThe seriousness of this um and that is something that people are worried about the ground level all across this country of conservative and liberal communities I see that people are concerned about climate change but my coat something different and I called global warming or\nWhat the level rise but people are very concerned about this but it's not translating ah in the state or federal leadership [noise]\nYeah exactly um you know here in Florida Jennifer he's right there are number of mayors and local officials particularly in South Florida where they're really getting hammered with\nSunny day flooding on a regular basis\nOr they have the southeast Florida regional climate compact that looks at how to mitigate against rising oceans looks at building codes looks at land use planning all of the things that you're talking about David actively started planning for this but John's right in that ah\nThese are piecemeal local efforts around this state which is the most vulnerable stayed in the country to this problem it's really remarkable\nYes I mean I guess you would think that at this is not the state\nLevel someone would step up but I\nDon't think they seem is making this hurricane coming through with Michael they've had they see me closer to home how do you do you think this one has really hit closer to home school\nBecause\nI think in the past you know they've always seen hurricane coming along the eastern coast and threw it especially the south so maybe this will open um everyone's eyes get\nAll the players in the state across it off the table as opposed to just the grassroots efforts up the in South Florida\nOkay and let's go to your calls in the aftermath of hurricane Michael\nWhat are your thoughts about Florida's response whether it comes to building codes sustainability efforts and more and by the way we had hoped to update every one on the road leaf efforts to the panhandle today but our gas was not able to be with us\nLots of supplies are heading west on I tend from Jacksonville this week to help people in Mexico beach in other communities that have simply been devastated by this storm\nIt's fine for nine to nine three seven and is on the north side Hi and good morning\nGood morning I'm I live on the ... river and um I have just recently had to apply for my flood insurance\nAnd which paid and a happy about that but I Know that there is a point in time when every insurance company or to say to me and to anyone who lives on the coast or wherever\nI you're no longer ensure of all we know that you're going to get hit again and you know it and we're not going to pay for it anymore and maybe fame out as say the same thing if they'll get hit before [noise] um at some point it just doesn't make sense to to support people who live in a dangerous situation [noise]\nAnd um now you're on the ... river did you get flooded during or after Hurricane Irma\nAh yes ma'am it came up to seven and a half feet at my house I I set out to be eight feet above sea level so I missed\nIt by ... by it flooded\nUnder my house and across the street and across the neighbor's yard and down and force for houses\nSo your your house and build sort of off like a ... I\nI moved no but it's up on blocks it's a it's a double wide okay and I did that because I had been flooded a number of times uh when I first moved to this house and I tore it down and put this one up and I mean up [noise] Joyce is three feet above where the other one was and I still almost got flooded [noise]\nMy gosh well I'm Glad that you weren't and I appreciate your point thanks for that and John up and\nYou know when you talk to actuaries insurance people what they will say privately is different from what they will say publicly about this but what they will concede privately is that at a certain point Florida's insurance property insurance market is going to\nGo and go into somewhat of a spiral that that a certain point insurers are going to pull back from the coast\nWhen ... when do you think that point is going to be\nWell I Do agree that that's inevitable and it comes down to uh how much money to the insurers are losing a lot of insurance that coal and not a is funded by the federal government\nIn Iraq constantly debate a in a Washington as to the extent to which we should continue a subsidizing using taxpayer money subsidizing this insurance\nAnd when insurance companies that when the federal government\nThat really jacking up those right we're going to set thing some cut the coast become unaffordable for the communities that are already living there so there is a great danger than increasing danger of letting the increasing danger of storms with climate change but now we're also or you know looking at the future there's also this this real rich of\nThat in an affordable increases in insurance rates which could drive many people away from their own\nRight yeah in the end that would be more than anything Jennifer I think what what pulls people inland ... they just wouldn't be able to pay the freight to to live on the coast\nRight and but also to build along those coastal winds\nThat structure that has to go into it to withstand stormed it's also very expensive so instead of spending money to live on the coast that is where you probably should not be building anyway to move in and build stronger inland\nBlake is in Jacksonville beach Hi Blake good morning\nGood morning I'm I'm a real estate attorney and I've done closing on on the teachers are primarily for about the last twenty two years I've done a little over ten thousand closings and I'm\nQuite often do closings have houses that are on the teacher used to the coastal construction control why\nAnd uh we've recently especially scene of all on a beach hard but I was listening with interest you guys discussing you know basically ... just don't build in these areas anymore\nDue to be able to to send things to to help take the time\nRight to look for the truck at the Jacksonville golfing country club you can go into you don't have to get past the gate that is a gated community but you can drive up to the country club anybody can uh just go in there drop off what

both my grandparents saw me succeed in with my books they both found me fall in love they they both met and Gina and in fact Gina where Shirley his wedding ring so when I when I explained to my grandparents that I was going to propose to her\nMy grandmother said you know what did you still want that rang meaning she calling up she'd always say Sunday I'm going to give you this ring and you can give that to the person you're going to get married to and um so so they both had that in fact\nI actually I I decided a little white lie to my grandfather on on his deathbed because he was always concerned about um [noise] my security as a how am I going to support myself as an artist so I had an a number of things and development to be movies\nAnd they had you know as it goes they had fallen apart and and he really you know you and you're talking to somebody when they're in their deathbed and they really seem like they're not they're huge still talk to them and so I explained to him that you know it really looks like this movie is going to get made and he's snap out of whatever ... are you are you telling me the truth [laughter]\nAnd I said yes and you know what maybe he knew in that moment I was lying [laughter] I don't know but um he just they always want to he wanted to know that I was\nGoing to be okay and and regardless of my professional track because of Gina they knew that I'd be okay they knew that she would would be a good partner for me in life\nWhen you're young you mother used to say to you about her addiction\nAnd about her not being lithium when are you going to get over it mhm\nAnd that's such a strange thing to say to a child is not something you ever get over and also puts the burden on you as a child to get over it rather than accepting responsibility for the problem that she created for him rather than accepting responsibility for her addiction and\nInability to overcome it for any sustained period of time\nIt will come to being the child of an addict [noise] yeah I mean are there are many times where I was like the older sibling and in fact sometimes my grandparents were refer to my mother as my sister you know um and in some kind of weird way I was because while my mother was Joe intro second oldest I was also joined Charles youngest child\nWhen you're a kid growing up you thought you were the only kid who was being raised by grandparents and who had a parent who was addicted and now you know that this is such an epidemic there's so many\nParents who have addiction problems and there's so many grandparents raising children um\nIt doesn't make you feel less alone can now and I also more responsible for telling your story but\nBut do you feel like oh I yeah\nI feel both I feel I feel that responsibility and I do feel less alone because it's not just kids too I mean there are other people my age or younger or older who will pull me aside and say oh we we have this in my family too and I have come to recognize the looks\nThat
