Florida on militarized get then as we interview the most compelling newsmakers of the first coast [noise]\nComing up this morning we'll discuss all the biggest stories of the week with our media roundtable weaken review then later the story of the American revolution Seventeen Seventy six on a local stage that in more ahead this hour on first can connect [noise]\nAfter the day's news [noise]\nThat people aren't really going by both camps for saying don't rely on the polls this go out and vote and I know I Believe was going to come down to two things one is going to be turnout on both ... both Republicans and Democrats have a ... there are people out their base was out to vote\nBecause both kinds of folk polar opposite they represent they represent two different things and everything is a non party here we have to find a place for Iran you know they are you know they have a choice between the two very different um wave to lead the state of Florida and\nThat's a find a place for rent and and it's very difficult to read right now where non part if it were for going with this election and and if you can get people out so therefore the strategy is to make sure you get people out to vote right you know\nNot only that and she or geo this mid term is really a referendum on the president and his agenda um as I mentioned uh he's worried about a wipe out in Florida you can expect him to visit the state at least twice before November\nSex and when he goes out and campaigns for congressional candidates or other candidates he'll say if you vote for a candidate acts you're voting for me uh this is a referendum on the president as well\nAnd more so here in Florida than anywhere else I thing because the scientists as tight as fortunate so closely with with Trump and everything that he does me basically trying to ride to coat tails of\nAn empire who has no clothes so it's going to take a leap of faith but it seems to me that's all he's got so it's just kind of a Hail Mary pass\nThe Republicans have made a mess of this day and people know\nAnd what in what way do you think that\nUh well the most obvious sign is is red ties of pollution that is spreading all roam around the coast is in my home county Palm Beach county the ones who came over to the Atlantic I think that that sealed the fate of the Republicans people can see that with their own eyes and people are very disgruntled ...\nThink once the red tide in circled the southern peninsula it made its way around to the eastern side of Florida whereas before it it's sort of been on the south west corner you think that more than any other issue is is is going to drive this in Florida maybe or no\nI Believe so I think people are starting to believe they're lying eyes\nAnd ears on principle we were from there with the I guess we'll see but it has to me but there are other issues there are other issues let's talk about some of it is that\nThe health care issue um and you know we saw before with a defenses relief an actual plan you know moments before the last debate that she didn't have before before the Republicans have just been saying we don't like Obamacare we don't like a minute Medicaid expansion\nA best way to go where they never really put forward a plan now our defenses have released a plan that you can actually you know pull apart and and and and examine\nWhereas um Gillum has had a plan all along you know he clearly stated what he wants to do with medical with their health care when he gets into office and so you ... and people have had a chance to say\nI'm for before I'm against that all along up until this point\nNow where they can begin to look at the dissenters plan and say\nYou know battle workers won't work or you know and obviously the again they are two different things with the spectrum\nIf you're a strong Donald Trump supporter you like Ron descendants because he's in line with this president on the issues that are really exciting the Republican base particularly immigration now that's not an issue that has come up\nA lot here in Florida but it's one that this isn't this race has become nationalized because as you pointed out Ron descent as his tied himself so closely to this President George yeah and so issues and normally you'd hear governor is talking about these hyper local and state wide only issues\nBut the candidates have really started playing on a national level this it's fascinating how nationalize this election is\nYou know it it is and you know the\nThe thing is that it's natural laws because Florida is the ultimate swing state and there everybody's looking at the twenty twenty\nIf you ... if you your party is has the governor of Florida you've got a great bully pulpit to turn the turn this state toward the presidential candidate in twenty twenty\nAnd the governor also has the authority to re drawn ... help ... district lines a ... a pick the next Supreme Court justices for Florida but there's a lot at stake here G. or geo just beyond a setting a state budget\nUh and these two candidates represent the divide in America I think almost perfectly I'm On the one and you've got this very traditional a hard right Republican member of the Freedom Caucus or was in Washington\nI'm On the other hand you've got a an urban cosmopolitan and the form of Andrew Gillum who's calling for Medicare for all and so\nUh you know we look at the early voting turnout and write as of right now I Do believe correct me if I'm wrong guys more Republicans and Democrats have voted by mail or an early voting ah we've got eleven days until election day and so the turnout an numbers\nThere are several sites that update on the turnout numbers and it's it's incredibly to me to see how many people are refreshing this website all the time they're in because they're so interested in the turnout numbers I've never I've never seen that in a midterm election never\nIf if I may go back to one thing you mentioned about in the ... the candidates representing their\nTheir respective parties I don't think the scientists represents the Republican Party you don't know I think he represents a wing of the Republican Party but uh I I think that there are a lot of common sense Republicans that are that are have I've talked to them they're appalled by what's going on\nWith the Republican Party as it now stands and I think that those folks are are starting to think about checking the power of the Republican Party and\nThe movie fit some Republicans will cross party lines\nI I I I Believe they will\nWhat if you're a Republican you don't like to send us but you just cannot see Andrew Gillum as ... as governor yes they they seem Gillum is too progressive for their value\nI mean that's difficult in this climate for someone to step to the other side of the trial just because they don't like the candidate you know that that what happened Twenty years ago both kind of difficult for you now with all of the things that they've that they've left unchecked at this point but I think\nAbout a lot of talk about polarization is is overblown to people that I talked to are more than willing to\nStep across the line and ... step across the aisle and vote for a Democrat if it means you know checking the power of the executive for instance\nA check into power or trying to put their party back to a a more centrist commonsense position because they're part they see their party is just going off the rails that is a folk selective political cartoonist at hall who we featured\nOn our cover last week and he says is a Republican and he'd ever since Trump won the nomination he saw the direction that party was going in and he decided to take a stand against him that stand includes voting for Democrats supporting Democrats in their campaigns\nLet's go to your calls five for nine to nine three seven of Mike Pence was in town this week to stump for Ron dissent is Joe Biden came the other day this time for Andrew Gillum and in a moment we'll talk about the FBI investigation into a Florida mail center as the manhunt continues for\nWhoever sent those pipe bombs out earlier this week what are your thoughts\nAbout the midterms than our political state of affairs it's fine for nine to nine three seven right now Herman is on the road somewhere hey Herman good morning\nThe morning overall [laughter] because\nYou already know exactly where I'm going in another part that carry out that I don't know what we should try as my own and not so much doubt what John\nLocke politics at it and John Burr\nWhy John Barr when you need him\nHe's right here [laughter]\nMany turn it on the job\nI say my\nPolitics based off rare Mackey John or\nA Tom sleigh Chris I'm not sure if it's a little bit New England in college and all the boys but the cat\n[laughter] ah I I thought my politics so what I don't if I'm John Barr I got it the wall [laughter]\nI guess part of it in order to\nHim you know what we mean well I I'm I'm totally flowers on leave right now and I have been [laughter]\nOut everything has been okay here's my question I kind of a concern that discovery with all these bombs gonna affect effect the election\nYeah yeah well that play back it well\nIs someone who's been a strong critic of the president and who the president has denounced at these frequent rallies that he holds that uh and so that is that it's been widely commented upon let's just say a mad at the beaches Hi Matt Good morning\nMorning I'm so one thing that I to me it is suspicious or but to me it's not necessarily\nGoing to be a Democrat because of course all Republicans are going to say that um you know the Russians not to go into it too high of a conspiracy but you know every one way to make a big deal out of that the two thousand six gene elections\nOr why isn't it happening and again you know and they try they haven't found any one right so\nA who says this isn't coming from a third party are trying to fight us because ultimately all these statistics I think you're on your show mentioned a that is a divide between Republicans and Democrats are becoming bottom garter over the decades and uh that's one way to destroy punch from itself is\nJust a divide everybody tribalism came up on another show in the uh yesterday afternoon yeah I it's just the lower division with the the greater the chance of of things bother\nOh sure yeah thought who's to say it's not another Russia not a you know we don't know we don't know whether there's plenty of countries that you know they want to get it get on the yeah we just don't know yet but I was\nJust find out what the FBI and ... um there's twelve Thirteen bombs smell and the more bombs the more evident Morris mushrooms\nAnd uh you know they seem to have zeroed in on where these things went through were were sent from I think the FBI has got a pretty good handle on this looks like they're going to find out who to ... ... what is this way you know\nInstead of throwing all these conspiracy theories\nAnd if you're just tuning in it's our friday media round table as we're talking about the biggest stories of the week we're going to move on now and talk about another issue that's a really a public health emergency in Florida and nationwide\nAnd new study out from Mayo Clinic finds that people throughout the country nearly all Americans would choose an alternative to opioids if they could\nFollowing surgery but few patients are actually talking to their doctors about this uh\nAs we talk about alternatives to opioids give us a call at five for nine to nine three seven\nBasically what mayor was saying is that if you're a patient with pain you should talk to your doctor about things like physical therapy acupuncture and other medications\nWe actually had the c._e._o. Florida blue on the show the other day and he was a Pat Garrett and he was challenged about the fact that insurance often doesn't cover alternative treatments to pain like acupuncture and other things but um and and uh\nBasically his response was well we're funding or sort of pilot programs on that and as soon as we have more data we can hopefully more widely cover these alternative treatments\nUm a lot of patients if they can they seek them out themselves because opioids are addictive or it is a public health emergency in this country the de la county morgue can't keep up with the ... literally can't keep up with the bodies that are coming in and so\nYou know how much responsibility do you guys think it is incumbent upon physicians and pharmaceutical\nGiant to to do a better job of finding a an alternative to this uh\nThat's caused such a deadly epidemic\nWell there was an interview with the Jamie Lee Curtis who's in the Halloween movies and she was talking about how she had to turn your addiction to opioids and it all started because she was prescribed opioids after having some minor cosmetic surgery mhm so people are already I'm\nProne or how proclivities to addiction\nThat can be the quote gateway drug to something that's prescribed\nIn a doctor's office and then that patient afterwards wants to keep getting that rush and so then it becomes a case of trying to get the drug whichever way they can so yes there's absolutely a\nMuch more needs to be done at the medical level to prevent that kind of episode triggering a lifelong addiction and I think it is being done I mean of\nMaybe the horses of a bar and certainly it is but I think I think the medical community has gotten the message that these hydra kono some of these other things we're way over prescribed to and it was very harmful and stupid thing to do\nI'll tell you the uh the industry that's waiting to just jump into the vacuum nearest medical marijuana industry or because they are\nOf health talking about pain relief all over the place for\nEverything from cancer treatments to uh you know I'm recovering from operation so [noise] um look for the medical marijuana industry to really try to\nTake a moon well you know jump into this uh on a friday\nDoctors have been harmlessly would they felt was harmlessly prescribing these medications over the years because that just because it was covered and it was easy for patients to get their hands on and wants to ... you know it became clear that this was the wrong path some doctors do try to get their patience you know engage in over parts of therapy that's going to be\nI'm just going to run out of a smaller refer them being addicted but there are barriers out your nose bears need to be addressed rasa in St Augustine Ross how good morning you're on the air\nWarning no that's okay on caller i._d. but my name's actually dark\n[laughter] this is your wife says Ross tell her I said hello\n[laughter] absolutely so I just moved down from Massachusetts recently but when I was up there I had my teeth out I only had to take it out it wasn't that bad but they prescribe me a massive bottle of like it in um I took you know one or two for a couple of days felt miserable on it\nUm and I stopped taking it but I still have this huge bottle of opioids that I have nothing to do is just sitting in the county sitting on the counter um I had a friend of mine and bring me a peanut butter cookie with Canada ... and I have to say that was one hundred times better I didn't feel crappy I was groggy and at the same time it managed to pay\nGood to hear a thanks for sharing your your testimony I'll you know medical marijuana is on the ballot this fall to ... uh in the form of the race for\nAgriculture commissioner and you've got a couple of candidates that have taken a somewhat ... somewhat varying positions on medical marijuana but clearly the voters in Florida have have settled that issue they want access to medical marijuana for pain relief and other things so\nUm it's interesting to hear that the testimonials about how people have reacted to it\nAnd they think that's the general trend all across the country as a you know that this is this is gonna happen eventually everywhere\nAre and to go back to the opioid crisis in general I mean you'd see this crisis exists at the intersection of not just medicine but industry and regulation also so the ... the entry of medical marijuana into the mix is part of\nRegulated medicine and we have to\n[noise] we can't leave it to the pharmaceutical industry or even the doctors who are prescribing pills to police themselves I mean there has to be a role for strong regulation when it comes to people's health\nWe're paying the consequences for that and we have to clean up the mess that they made yeah and that\nFor the guy who just called actually when it comes to the disposing of unwanted prescriptions like your bottle of bike it in the you called and said you just don't have anything to to use it for actually this Saturday tomorrow October twenty seventh is national prescription drug\nTake back bay\nAnd so it's a date set aside for people to return their on unwanted prescriptions let me\nGoogle this right now as her stand as are sitting here uh talking about this so I ...
