I'm Melissa Ross if I did is we interview the most compelling newsmakers of the first coast [noise]\nComing up this morning on nasty second debate between Florida and gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum Enron descent as as the vice president's Thompson Florida for the Republican that in more I had this hour on first can connect\nAfter the day's news [noise]\nOf which he is wholly accountable and owned by when I took on the n._r._a. suit management me through court for two years all because we had a city ordinance which said you could not shoot guns in city parks when we win this race it'll be simple it's not a threat to the second amendment if you want to own the power of God at your waist vote you ought to have a background check\nIf you want to have you weren't domestic violence as users convict you shouldn't have a gun that you could solve a lot of your loved ones when our parents or our kids off at school we should have an expectation that we'll be able to pick them up a lot of time\nAnd by the way the moderators struggle to keep these\nThe candidates to time not a strong moderate yeah\nRight so you see Andrew Gillum then as some as more meeting\nThe mood of the moment that said early voting is underway\nRepublicans so far are up at pacing Democrats in the overall vote totals and so for both of these candidates Mr Gillum and Mr ... than is turning out their base is everything it do you feel both of them accomplish those goals last night as they hit on all of these major issues\nFor you I mean you know I think both of them reached out to their bases are going to get between eighty Ninety percent of their respective parties polling has basically showing the polling fact Russia and kill 'em in the nineties I don't know if that's going to hold\nBut the swing voters are really the ones that you know trying to be reached with us and that's where you know they're playing the dozens last night between the two candidates and that's where it works out and goes favor I made the Santa went into that debate I think he could message off of you know Gillum scandals including the Hamilton tickets that he got from the FBI according to a\nYou know data was release released this week\nI'm you know and and this and this can capitalize I mean you know kill and got the line and we got nine nine problems by Hamilton a one\nYeah and that's the one that people are gonna remember 'em in the Santa says tone is not something that is appealing and swing voters and the way the Gillum says you know and that's where the corruption narrative came in and you know this sounds really couldn't close the deal on it last night\nWhat about vice president Mike Pence coming to Jacksonville to campaign for just sent us in the Republican ticket how big of a difference do you see that making for Republicans\nUm I you know I've talked to play some go where the Republican Party chair of the state you know he said that Pence was here to drive based turned out I mean that's the thing they're wanting to get the early vote saw Jacksonville they're going to increase the margin here\nYou know the fantasy of sad that this region is key to you know his strategy and he's pulled better Gillum here so basically is running up the number ... safe media market for parents\nI'm not quite like down south where you might become more adversarial way it'll be friendly coverage it'll it'll be one where ... comes out and makes cases that skill and is not right for the state the Gillum is off base in corrupt and\nToo far to the left and to extremely Mike Pence is very good at you know selling the Southern Baptist tones that appeal to a certain type of voter about er swing voters going to respond to my parents know this is for the base\nOkay and let me ask you this uh out of all the issues in this race guns education immigration a race itself lots of issues are on the menu but those undecided voters\nThere are anecdotal indications that some of them are moving to kill him over the issue of health care and coverage for pre existing conditions do you think ... that that issue will be decisive\nOr not or in this race\nIs something that Democrats are betting heavily on not just in the governor's race but up and down the ballot um you know if you look at any contested race to preserve certain conditions question comes in we see what the Senate race between Scott and also even see with Nancy Soderberg Mike Wallace whose congressional race down south\nUm these are this is a big issue I don't know if that's going to be the one that actually balances with voters Rick Scott as saying that he's force protection of pre existing conditions to Santa says that\nUm Trump says that the Republicans are saying these things which makes you wonder what was happening in the last two years when you know the mantra was repeal and replace Obamacare there was no mention of pre existing conditions in there so Democrats are hoping that voters remember that um I\nI'm skeptical that is really going to stick in a way they're hoping um it's sort of an esoteric thing unless you have health issues in which case as a primary thing but in in that case you're probably leaning Democrat anyway\nLet's go to your calls now as we talk about last night's big debate the final one thank goodness [laughter] I think it'd be hard to watch sometimes ah they get so ugly between Rhonda Santos and Andrew Gillum for governor as vice president Pence came to town and\nThe political season is in high high gear here in Florida five for nine to nine three seven Reginald as in orange park K Reginald mourning\nMourning ma'am okay thanks go ahead oh beautiful hey look debate last night\nIt only knows what's going on in a ... version and we think those are divided them or they want to see what we come to the point where we are when I don't know what it is it's going to continue\nThe we as long as we're called grown and I think that would go look directly what crime with it when it came on with it\nBut we gotta stop me baby I I we got a call ... we're going to go to Lee don't come together it why do I promise you\nCook it would not lead role because I'll buy it will not staying with a book called the ... you got the ocean and destroyed but until we or when I go to trial\nAnd people talk line okay we'll achieve anything but in this country\nWas so much that we have to do much much better than what we're doing and I thank you for your time\nNo thank you Reginald and you know he's so right at ... it's\nFrightening what's happening now are these suspicious packages these pipe bombs that were delivered Twitter is now reporting a multiple sites including the Associated Press that Joe Biden I guess just received one of the house as well\nUm\nThe rhetoric the anger the threats of violence um the demonizing of your political opponent\nThis is a dangerous place for this country to be and\nIt's a familiar place for his country to be because time and time again you see demonization of political opponents I mean go back to the Eighteen Nineteen centuries and you can see things that wouldn't fly today things that you know would not be done by an official campaign being done and can't you know campaigns that just have gotten forgotten\nYou know what we're seeing now is we're seeing the stakes for bigger on all sides corporations put more money and behind the Republican side the unions and all the Democratic side\nAnd you know it is a clash I mean it's not a negotiating time\nYou know that brief period of the mid to late ... century where you saw a bipartisan consensus on issues\nI Believe that's over and it's going to be a turf war for a while it may be true for the rest of our lifetimes because the issues that we're facing or issues scarcity issues of resource allocation\nIssues of why we divergent Arabs um I don't think you just work it out with the can buy all moment it's going to take a lot of conflicts can take a lot of political careers rising and falling and\nA lot of debate like we saw last night I think that's the future not in a mall nominally\nI I I agree um now that said and as you correctly pointed out this country has been in these this place many times before it can\nBe easy to forget that but at the same time uh this is not good for America to have\nPeople that hateful towards each other and to see the other political party is eat evil I mean you know I\nI Know families that had been torn apart torn apart by this they don't speak anymore and the you know you have to go back almost to the civil war to to to see that kind of a\nOutcome ... it's it's tragic and this is true this is tragic that this tribalism is tragic and it's it's frightening I think and um\nYou know we can joke about the ... slung on television in a debate but this is a serious time this is a frightening time for many Americans\nYeah it is and I mean you really dealing with two candidates that are kind of mirror image to each other in some ways both and came up from working class roots you know both of them have you been in politics for a while now and I mean both option real ambition I mean\nAnd they play to their respective wings I mean Gillum this play to Soros wing you know he did the troops with people for the American way the troops to I'll be\nYes ma'am I voted yesterday I called in thirty three ... spent two hours on the computer [noise] got it done of figuring out what I mean but I wanted to remind you got something we talk about going all the way back to the civil war what am I\nI'm sixty six greatest heroes in my lifetime Martin Luther king the Freedom Riders men and women who fought on the streets of a Mississippi and Alabama\nThat was tough I think it was a convention in Chicago where there was a lot of trouble\nSo they're saying nothing new it's been going on for a long time and it always will Bernie Sanders is why I Am a Republican a straight Republican but Bernie Sanders is right I ... on Social Security Medicare I spent forty one hundred dollars a year and a shot on there so we can have\nWe can have a Medicare for everyone but it'd be supplemented we can't do it I think we spend about ... percent of our gross toll on um insurance and are people will vote based on the second amendment\nAnd they will vote on pro life\nAnd what and what not and throw your vote to vote straight just because you're a lifelong Republican or was there a particular issue this time\nI'm pretty much in tune with a\nRight wing conservative values except\nOn with Bernie standard on Medicare and partially I watched both debate I think this gentleman that is a Republican he graduated from Yale he graduated from Harvard Nazi everything different I thought he was extremely comes communicated extremely well\nUm and I thought the gentleman that Democrats used a lot of\nWords that he shouldn't have used it just it should go that direction he might get more voters if he was a little more gracious\nOkay alright what it I I I I appreciate your calling Chuck sharing your thoughts thanks jak\nYeah I I don't I don't know if things are going was going to reach a six six six year old white man versus true Republican I'm that's basically a GOP based right there\nYou know and and it's interesting though his his take on Medicare and Social Security as it relates to enter this race because\nYou know ... around the sand is has been very slow on putting his policies after he put his health care policies such as it is up during the debates on his website you mean yeah yeah and you know so you know they knew where he's still in health care and nobody really knows where he stands on healthcare now because it's a it's a fragmentary policy the hasn't bothered to roll out\nSo you have to wonder what Ron this sounds really ones besides to continue the status quo mean considering the status quo is not a plant um you know Rick Scott came in eight years ago\nAnd you know he was responding to conditions that were true in two thousand ten thousand these teens generation\nWe've really remarkable the degree to which\nThe electorate has moved on and now the idea of Medicare for all is not seen as radical anymore\nOr coverage for pre existing conditions is now the baseline and so that you know whereas ten years ago even five years ago that was very controversial so you see Republicans kind of scrambling to move to where the voters have moved on this small\nYeah I mean that's that's typically Republican way which is you know stay on the poor history and you know stop and what isn't stopped jump on the train\nBut you know when you look at what's happening to voters this economically driven I think on both sides really because the two thousand a recession a lot of people didn't see recovery from it personally the larger economy theoretically recovered but we've seen a wealth redistribution in the bombing years and now the Trump beers\nTo have privilege corporations privileged to Pluto crass and we see a vastly different country and when people can't afford health care when people can afford to go to the dentist when people work as hard as they can and they're not only not getting ahead but they're falling behind\n'em then they're going to be looking for government to do more because there was a fair trickled down approach hasn't worked for them\nLet's take one more call Susan in Mandarin Hi Susan go ahead\nPrime Melissa I just want to let people know I you know I'm a Christian I'm a former prosecutor I'm a former bond for ... and I have been very similar to this level in terms of our history and I've been following the ...\nSince the beginning of his career many years ago and I can help people without a doubt he is it because they're a cater of the highest order and he is the exhibits slobbering their ability to whoever\nIs that has bought him when he first started it was big sugar and a lot of hip point oh I'm is bought\nAnd sold by track that are far afield and outside of the state of Florida for one thing that voters should understand is that what Ron before this one is not\nTo help the people of Florida writer scientists is a consummate politician and Florida is just to stop on his way to bigger and better things\nHe absolutely will not take free money from the federal government in order to help the people of Florida whether it will special security and Medicare expansion or any\nWell now the Medicaid expansion is almost ... just to clarify a little of the state would have to pay a little bit there but but go ahead quickly\nYes and he will not address issues like erosion or red tide he is slow to put\nA policy position of 'em in the public arena because he has to be getting those policy that opposition by the people who are sponsoring him so whatever the differences are between Andrew Gillum\nEnron than test the people of Florida should understand that wrong to hold and lack of the people of Florida and we never will be okay a\nThanks for that or she did mention big sugar we do need to point out and kill and got a a tough question last night as well about his ties to the sugar industry um but that said uh lots of opinions shared this morning your final thoughts\nUm my final thoughts um I Want to address what the caller said briefly and you know she's got a point I mean this and this was in Congress three terms he didn't really want to be there\nUm you know that was kind of thing that came out because he ran for Senate a mark Rubio got back to ... he got out of the Senate race in grudgingly ran for reelection the Congress but he wasn't his district much people are in his district said he didn't really bother constituent issues and\nYou know that's that's been a lot of people are saying a lot of people are saying you've seen this was hopping from one job to the next in the same as has gotten a lot of money from people out of state um\nGillum has as well to be fair\nYeah I mean we mentioned in the beginning of the program is is just kind of a different kind of thing 'cause what do these people why why does somebody in Chicago's got a new putting five million dollars is the same as campaign actually want from a we knew what torture is once we know what Tom Sawyer was we don't really know what the sandstone just once and I I think that's the problem\n[noise] [noise] well you didn't hold back on your thoughts on this one uh always good to have you on the show and again early voting is underway vote your preference ... thanks as always for being with us we'll be

the difference between blind optimism things will be fine you'll magically have enough money for retirement versus what is called conditional optimism retirement will be fine if we have a savings plans\nRobbers and economists to New York university's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of two winners of the Nobel Prize in economics stuffed Romer welcome to the program\nGoing to be here I mean since you won the prize the other day has been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses be patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nIf you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization in the way this was gonna destroy jobs\nThe complacent attitude would have been to say uh it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine that's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was this sense of we've got to do the right thing the twentieth century there was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the local high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment of education everything turned out better for everybody but if you just are complacent and say oh it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also\nDue to the labor force with\nArtificial intelligence automation robots are entering everyone says a highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who say don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism help us with what\nTech will do to the workforce this time around\nAbsolutely ... and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say you know twenty century turned out fine so there is no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine\nAnd so there's no basis for complacency in the success record that we can see when we look back there are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and in thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turned out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably I think I'm a pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights an economics has this idea of a division of labor and do the thing you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody\nSo there's a process that involves a kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or any other politician builds coalitions they try to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else we can do as economists scientists more generally uh say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there's some things that you could try\nBut you will ... where you are the ones who make a decision\nAnd before we go duck to remember at UC Berkeley when they win a Nobel Prize they get an assigned parking spot did NYU

then later the story of the American revolution Seventeen Seventy six on a local stage that and more I had this hour on first kiss connect [noise]\nNot one that I've seen in many years\nIn ... adding to that is the fact that we really can't trust the polls are so many polls out here and have been so unreliable in the past\nThat people aren't really going by both camps for fans don't rely on the polls this go out and vote and I know I Believe was going to come down to two things one is going to be turnout on both ... um Republicans and Democrats have their people all the bases out to vote\nBecause both kinds of soap polar opposite they represent their representative of things and everything is a mom part if you will have to find a place to land you know the art you know they have a choice between the two very different ways to lead the state of Florida\nAnd they have to find a place for rent and and it's very difficult to read right now where now part if it were for going with this election and if you can get people out so therefore the strategy is to make sure you get people out of all\nRight you know not only that she or geo this mid term is really a referendum on the president and his agenda um as I mentioned uh he's worried about a wipe out in Florida you can expect him to visit the state\nAt least twice before November sex and when he goes out and campaigns for congressional candidates or other candidates he'll say if you vote for a candidate acts you're voting for me uh this is a referendum on the president as well\nMore so here in Florida than anywhere else for them because the scientists as tight as fortunate so closely with with Trump and everything that he does he's basically trying to ride to coat tails of\nAn empire who has no clothes so it's going to take a leap of faith but it seems to me that's always gone so it's just kind of a Hail Mary pass\nThe Republicans have made a mess of this thing and people know\nAnd what in what way do you think that\nUh well the most obvious ... red ties with pollution that is spreading all roam around the coast is in my home county Palm Beach county the ones that came over to the Atlantic I think that that's sealed the fate of the Republicans people can see that with their own eyes and people are very disgruntled we would\nGo you think once the red tide and circled the southern peninsula and made its way around to the eastern side of Florida whereas before it it's sort of been on the south west corner you think that more than any other issue is is it's going to drive this in Florida maybe or no\nI Believe so I think people are starting to believe they're lying eyes\nAnd the ... with\nThe I guess we'll see but it it made us the me but there are other issues there are other issues let's talk about some\nOf it is for the health care issue and you know we fall before with a defense was relief an actual plan you know moments before the last debate that she didn't have before before but Republicans have just been\nYou don't like Obamacare we don't like a minute Medicaid expansion\nOr best not the way to do what they never really put forward a plan now\nOur defenses have released a plan but you can actually you know pulled apart and and and and examine whereas I'm do um have had a plan all along you know he clearly stated what he wants to do with medical with their health care when it gets into office and so you ... and people have had a chance to say I'm for before I'm against that all along up until this point\nNow where they can begin to look at the dissenters plan and say\nYou know battle work with this won't work or you know and obviously the again they're two different ends of the spectrum\nIf you're a strong Donald Trump supporter you like Ron descendants because he's in line with this president on the issues that are really exciting the Republican base particularly immigration now that's not an issue that has come up a lot here in Florida\nBut it's one that this is in this race has become nationalized because as you pointed out Ron descent as his tied himself so closely to this President George yeah and so issues and normally you'd hear governors talking about these hyper local and state wide only issues\nBut the candidates have really started playing on a national level this it's fascinating how nationalize this election is\nYou know it is and you know the the thing is the\nNational laws because Florida is the ultimate swing state and there everybody's looking at the twenty twenty if you ... if you your forties has for governor of Florida you've got a great bully pulpit to turn the turn this state toward the presidential candidate in twenty twenty\nAnd the governor also has the authority to re drawn ... district lines a ... a pick the next Supreme Court justices for Florida but there's a lot at stake here G. or geo just beyond a setting a state budget\nUh and these two candidates represented divided America I think almost perfectly I'm On the one hand you've got this very traditional a hard right Republican member of the Freedom Caucus or was in Washington\nI'm On the other hand you've got a an urban cosmopolitan in the form of Andrew Gillum who's calling from Medicare for all and so uh you know we\nLook at the early voting turnout and write as of right now I Do believe correct me if I'm wrong guys\nMore Republicans and Democrats have voted by mail or in early voting ah we've got eleven days until election day and so\nThe turnout a numbers there are several sites that update the turnout numbers and it's it's incredibly to me to see how many people are refreshing this website all the time they because they are so interested in the turnout numbers I've never I've never seen that an emitted from election never\nIf if I may go back to one thing you mentioned about the candidates representing their\nTheir respective parties I don't think decide this represents the Republican Party you don't know I think he represents a wing of the Republican Party but uh I I think that there are a lot of common sense Republicans that are that are have I've talked to them they're appalled by what's going on\nWith the Republican Party as it now stands and I think that those folks are are starting to think about checking the power of the Republican Party and\nLosing some Republicans will cross party lines\nI I I I Believe they will\nWhat if you're a Republican you don't like the saying is that you just cannot see Andrew Gillum as ... as governor of all day and they see Gillum is too progressive for their value\nI mean that's difficult in this climate for someone to step to the other side of the ... just because they don't like the candidate you know that that what happened Twenty years ago both kind of difficult for you now with all of the things that they've that they've left unchecked at this point but I I think\nA lot of talk about polarization is is overblown to people that I talked to are more than willing to\nStep across the line and ... step across the aisle and vote for a Democrat if it means you know checking the power of the executive for instance\nI checked into power or trying to put their party back to a a more centrist commonsense position because they're part they see their party is just going off the rails that is a bit folks like leaves political cartoons at hall who we featured\nOn our cover last week and the use of is a Republican and he'd ever since Trump won the nomination he saw the direction of party was going in and he decided to take a stand against in this day and includes voting for Democrats supporting Democrats and their campaigns\nLet's go to your calls five for nine to nine three seven ... Mike Pence was in town this week to stump for ... Joe Biden came the other day to stump for Andrew Gillum and in a moment we'll talk about the FBI investigation into a Florida mail center as the manhunt continues for\nWhoever sent those pipe bombs out earlier this week what are your thoughts about the midterms than our political state of affairs it's fine for nine to nine three seven right now Herman is on the road somewhere hey Herman good morning\nThe morning overall [laughter] [laughter] because\nYou already know exactly where I'm going\nAnd another part that carry ... I don't know what we should try is my own and I'm so my what John\nLocke politic why are you mad at John Burr ... job or when you're needing\nHe [laughter]\nAny time if that's our job\nTo say\nMy politics bags do Freddie Mac the job or\nA Tom slowly Chris I'm not sure it was in college and all the bars what before\n[laughter] I I thought my politics but what I don't jog or I get it [laughter]\n[noise] it's all of\nThem you know what we will hear I'm I'm totally flat or leave right now but [laughter]\nI Hope everything goes but okay here's my question concerns the discovery with all these bombs going to affect the election yeah yeah ...\n... well on that kind of stuff so that and to everybody and even a welcome\nThat's writer and then yeah we welcome him back he spends part of the air outside of Florida smart man I Wish we all could do that actually in the summer months\nAh okay so Herman's question about these pipe bombs that were sent to former President Clinton and Hillary Clinton Iraq and Michelle Obama CNN Robert De Niro Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan ... they were\nAll sent it to the homes of these people most of them are all sent to top Democrats and very high profile critics of President Trump you saw this a bizarre push back uh I ... in some quarters from a\nWell it it it it ... the president did tweet\nSomething out about a\nDialing down the rhetoric but it but at the same time it must be said that everyone has been targeted by these bombs\nIs someone who's been a strong critic of the president and who the president has denounced at these frequent rallies that he holds that uh and so that is that has been widely commented upon let's just say a mad at the beaches Hi Matt Good morning\nMorning I'm so one thing that I to me it is suspicious or but to me it's not necessarily\nGoing to be a Democrat because of course all Republicans are going to say that um you know the last year and it was not to go into it too high of a conspiracy but you know every one way to make a big deal out of that the two thousand six gene elections or why isn't it happening and again you know when they try they haven't found any one right so\nAh who says this isn't coming from a third party are trying to fight us because ultimately all these statistics I think you're on your show mentioned a that is a divide between Republicans and Democrats or become a lot of water over the decades and uh that's one way to destroy punch from itself is\nJust a divide everybody tribalism came up on another show in the uh yesterday afternoon and I it's just the the more division the the greater the chance of of things fall to\nAssure just thought I've who's to say it's not another Russian up a you know we don't know we don't know whether there's plenty of countries that you know they want to get a sauce on the yeah we just don't know yet if\nIt was just find out what the FBI and ... um there's twelve Thirteen bumps knew him the more bombs the more evident more semesters and ah you know they seem to have zeroed in on where these things went through worse worse I'm from I think the FBI has got a pretty good handle on this look forward to our our Fonda who did it\nWhat was it this way you know instead of throwing all these conspiracy theories\nAnd if you're just tuning in is our friday media round table and so we're talking about the biggest stories of the week we're going to move on now and talk about another issue that's a really a public health emergency in Florida and nationwide\nA new study out from Mayo Clinic finds that people throughout the country nearly all Americans would choose an alternative to opioids if they could\nFollowing surgery but few patients are actually talking to their doctors about this uh\nAs we talk about alternatives to opioids give us a call at five for nine to nine three seven\nBasically what mayor was saying is that if you're a patient with pain you should talk to your doctor about things like physical therapy acupuncture and other medications\nWe actually had the c._e._o. Florida blue on the show the other day and he was a Pat Garrett and he was challenged about the fact that insurance often doesn't cover alternative treatments to pain\nLike acupuncture and other things but um and and uh basically his response was well we're funding or sort of pilot programs on that and as soon as we have more data we can hopefully more widely covered these alternative treatments\nUm a lot of patience if they can they seek them out themselves because opioids are addictive or it is a public health emergency in this country the ... county morgue can't keep up with the ... literally can't keep up with the bodies that are coming in and so\nYou know how much responsibility do you guys think it is incumbent upon physicians and pharmaceutical\nGiant to to do a better job of finding a an alternative to this a\nMad that's caused such a deadly epidemic\nWell there was an interview with the Jamie Lee Curtis who's in the Halloween movies and she was talking about how she had to turn your addiction to opioids\nAs all started because she was prescribed opioids after having some minor cosmetic surgery mhm so people are already I'm prone to preclude these two\nAddiction that can be recording gateway drug to something that's prescribed\nIn a doctor's office in them that patient afterwards wants to keep getting that rush and so then it becomes a case of trying to get the drug whichever way they can so just there's absolutely you have a more needs to be done at the medical level to prevent that kind of\nEpisode triggering a lifelong there from you know and I think it is being done I mean or\nMaybe the horses are born or when it is but I think I think the medical community has gotten the message that\nThese ... these are the things we're way over prescribe to and it was very harmful stupid thing to do I'll tell you the uh the industry that's waiting to just jump into the vacuum mirrors medical marijuana industry\nOr because they are talking about pain relief all over the place for\nEverything from cancer treatments to uh you know I'm recovering from operation so um look for the medical marijuana industry to really try to ...\nTo ... you know jump into this uh on a friday\nDoctors have been harmlessly what they felt was harmlessly prescribing these medications over the years because just because it was covered and it was easy for patients to do their hands on\nAnd once it became you know it became clear that this was the wrong path from doctors do try to get their patients you know engaged in overtime for therapy that's going to be I'm just going to be run over or smaller refer them being addicted on but there are barriers up your nose bears need to be addressed\nRasa in St Augustine recite good morning you're on the air\nWarning no that's okay I Will go on caller i._d. but when he was actually dark\n[laughter] this is your life [laughter] caller i._d. says Ross tell her I said hello [laughter]\nAbsolutely so I just moved down from Massachusetts recently but when I was up there I had my teeth out I only had to take it out it wasn't that bad but they prescribe me a massive bottle of like it in um I took you know one or two for a couple of days felt miserable on it um and I stopped taking it\nBut I still have this huge bottle of opioids that I have nothing to do is just sitting in the counter sitting on the counter um I had a friend of mine bring me a\nPeanut butter cookie with Canada say and I have to say that was one hundred times better I didn't feel crappy I was groggy and at the same time it managed to pay\nGood to hear a thanks for sharing your your testimony I'll you know medical marijuana is on the ballot this fall to George ... or in the form of the race for\nAgriculture commissioner you've got a couple of candidates that have taken a somewhat ... somewhat varying positions on medical marijuana but clearly the voters in Florida have have settle that issue they want access to medical marijuana for pain relief and other things so\nUm it's interesting to hear that the testimonials about how people have reacted to it\nBut yeah I think that's the general trend all across the country as a you know that this is this is gonna happen eventually everywhere\nAre and to go back to the opioid crisis in general I mean you see this crisis exists at the intersection of not just medicine but industry and regulation also so the ... the entry of medical marijuana into the mix is is part of\nRegulated medicine and we have to\nWe can't leave it to the pharmaceutical industry or even the doctors who are prescribing pills\nTo police themselves I mean there has to be a role for strong regulation when it comes to people's health because we're paying the consequences for that and we have to clean up the mess that they made\nYeah and that for the guy who just called actually when it comes to the disposing of unwanted prescriptions like your bottle of Ike it in the you called and said you just don't have anything to to use it for\nActually this Saturday tomorrow October twenty seventh is national prescription drug take back day\nAnd so it's a date set aside for people to return their on unwanted prescriptions let me Google is right now as her stand as are sitting here are talking about this so I if I Hope he's still listening a so that you know what to do\nYour bike it and go to take back de da da da da da da de and it's a chance for\nYou to uh\nDo something with your bottle of vodka and are there are collection site low caters all over the country you can search at that website\nTake back de da da da da\nDun ... weekend at the Jacksonville lending a permit application at the landing to host Florida Georgia festivities\nHad actually been on hold in part due to
