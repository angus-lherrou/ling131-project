E. A. remember\nWhen that uh became a huge matter of discussion well if this passes\nThe straw ballot measure which is the last thing on your November ballot unless you're in Atlantic beach then I think it's the second to last item that's what it's actually tell the city council that voters want to have a say in any sale of more than ten percent of J. E. A. now this is non binding but it is your chance to have your voice heard\nThe measure was created by John crescent Benny at large city councilman group to and chair of the Nineteen members special committee on Jay ... potential sale he joins us now councilman good to see you for having me good city of Mosul\nAnd here's our question to callers\nHow do you plan to vote on this measure the straw ballot measure over the future of Jay give us a call with your thoughts and questions at five for nine to nine three seven that's five for nine to nine three seven okay\nThis is not the first time by the way that the city council has held discussions about selling J. E. A. but it went further than it ever had before last year or earlier this year is that what prompted you to push for the straw ballot measure\nThat did this uh this is the third discussion that the council's had the first to want occurred in two thousand I'm ... and the second occurred in two thousand twelve they were both occurring in times where the city was facing significant revenue shortfalls I think the council members were trying to figure out a way to supplement their budget\nThose discussions were very short lived compared to what happened in twenty eight team this conversation went on for months special committee was convened in ah February we met through we we met weekly through July was much more extensive now in two thousand and seven as a citizen of the time I took the position that if\nThe city were ever to contemplate selling Jay\nIt should be a decision by the citizens of the voters the shareholders of the utility that's the publicly owned utility not the city council but during the recent discussion this year I learned to interesting provisions in the charter one was that the charter already says that if the board of directors were ... you know he wants to sell more than ten percent of the utility\nThat will terms and conditions without so you'll have to be approved by the city council by a majority vote that's ten out I'm Nineteen members with another provision in the ... in the charter that deals with Jay ... says if the council wants to change the charter\nAs it relates to Jay that requires a two thirds vote or Thirteen members of the city council out of my team so I find that very interesting that we can sell a multibillion dollar asset with ten votes but in order to tweak the language and the charter that would take Thirteen boats so\nI introduced legislation to poll voters on this subject and also introduced a charter change which has been part since the early part of beer and will move forward is this a straw ballot measure is voted on favorably by the public\nSo then ... ... even though this uh weighing in by the voters is not a binding matter this is I guess your way of letting everyone know where you think the voters stand on this\nRight 'cause right now the city council makes the bottle decision on any potential future sailed Jay so the voters have a question in front of them that says that if you think you should have that right you should be the final voice than you would vote yes on the straw ballot initiative\nIf you're OK with the city council making the final decision than usual should probably vote no on the measure\nWhy are you against the sale of Jay\nI'm decision about whether we're selling ... yeah you're\nNot I know but it but I think it's pretty clear that you and you don't I don't it does not seem as though you're in support of this notion\nI Can't no ... I'm trying to empower the people to participate in the process so I have no idea what his potential sailed Jay you would look like that would be like me asking you would you like to sell your house\nWhat would your answer be I think it would be dependent on what you would sell it for so that's that's a whole 'nother discussion this this exercise is purely to involve the citizens in that decision making process\nNo political theater involved here this is an an Enron maybe around mayor Cory who has a seemed to be more in favor of this idea\nA lot from my perspective I Can't speak for this was voted on unanimously by the council to do on the November sixth ballot\nThat's not my into a ... again I took a position of two thousand and seven I wasn't on the city council there was a new mayor Cory at the time I just was acting as a citizen and said we need to\nUh put a decision like sewing ... in front of the voters it's their utility it doesn't belong to the city council belongs to every citizen there'll be well county so I think they should be they should hold the the keys to the fate of the utility if if it were ever decided to be sold\nThere was a widespread perception that the mayor might have been a okay with this idea of being floated a that was strong push back the idea that didn't make it for this is a process do you think the mayor will float this idea again perhaps after he's reelected if he's ...\nI can tell you that there are a lot of people I talk to and I've been out you know promoting this a straw valid to see\nPacks neighborhood organizations homeowners' associations any any group little have me and there's a lot of ah folks out in the world I think that this issue's going to come back up after next year's spring elections so\nI I don't know whether it will or won't but if it\nIf it does or doesn't this was a good safeguard going forward in the future sort of this conversation does come back up next year we're in ten years or Twenty years the charter school have been amended to allow the citizens to participate in that final decision about whether or not but you shouldn't be sold and what we do before the voters\nWould be whatever deal the board of directors approved\nAnd subsequently went to the council to be approved to the voters can make a determination the voters are smart they've weighed in on pension plan reform they looked at the better Jacksonville plan I mean they know how to drill down through the details of a proposal and determine whether it's right or wrong for the city going forward\nA lot of the people out there may not realize is that having a city on utility for a city that size is not really common it is not any more notice\nWould you sell your house you can't answer that question because you don't know what the terms or for the ...\nThat's a decision for the future and I think that's a decision but voters commendable\nCouncilman John ... always good to see like Washington thanks for being with us much more still had a later it's world stroke day what doctors at Mayo want\nYou to know the signs and symptoms that can uh save your life if you move quickly but up next why PBS NewsHour has its eyes on battleground Florida\nSpecial show tonight will have a preview\n\nIberia backed backed by over one hundred Thirty years of experience and history Iberia back is proud to support W.

I mean the the world all the way to\nA hosted the entire ecosystem all those farmers have decimated practices developed by the university and then in addition we expanded that to all of our first magnitude spring so effectively covers nearly the entire land area from Pensacola to Orlando\nUh because we're such that we have such a blessing of London respect your spring of ... state governed by that law\nOkay ah another ah\nArea that has been a flashpoint in this race is gun regulation\nA and I'm putting them the incumbent a\nCame under\nCriticism when it was revealed that his department issued gun permits to some Floridians before the background checks were reviewed the department of agriculture and consumer services does run the background checks for concealed weapons\nPermits or you voted against the gun control bill that passed after the\nMassacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school you have an a plus rating from the national Rifle Association certainly that will drive a gun rights proponents to your column what would you say to those who differ from you on how the state regulates guns and how that should be managed by this department\nWell this is a\nQuestion my my wife's a school teacher my daughter's in public school ap euro interest in seeing guns play uh\nYou know what happened in Parkland\nIs both the school district and the sheriff failed to address an individual who had demonstrated history being a danger to himself and the fellow students in his school and that's where I wanted to focus I think where we should focus middle hell\nSchool safety features that dealt with guns in that bill or none of them would have had any impact on what happened with Nikolas Cruz that were totally unrelated and it's really the the tragedy of that kind of build a building\nThat you people run down the road focusing on something that they claim as a solution and you don't really make progress on it\nUm I no one should get a license Bert concealed weapons in the state if they are qualified and if someone's not doing their job is was clearly the case at twenty Thirteen or they should be fired\nThey won a transition after the election hopefully I'm In a position to make this decision we're going to review the entire concealed weapons program top to bottom and make sure that I'm personally satisfied safeguards in place that again\nBoth of

unwanted calls how would you\nImprove the way the state manages a all of these consumer related issues [noise] sure\nAnd this is really a big part of the job is making sure that we're protecting seniors when you think about how large our senior population here is in this state and how much of a target we are and it comes down to investigation and prosecution or you're going to be constantly trying to follow the scammers follow the con artist\nOr where they're moving to the next new shiny thing a catch them in the act and and really take seriously the prosecution I think that the\nThe uh the key part of it is you know we have such a focused and rightfully so\nIn a in our local courts going after individuals who commit murder Baptist drug crimes are in financial crime or actually sometimes don't seem to rise to the same level and that certainly going to be a focus myself and I I think the other cabinet members will uh to to the caller's question I I think\nSome folks might not know about a decade ago of Florida maybe a little longer than that but in a cap\nOn the interest rate it can be charged a financial services to actually have to commit to certain interest rates depending on what kind of loan product it is but they can't discharge whatever they want and they can't charge predatory fees in terms of this state we also work\nWhile I was chair of the house issued

races on the ballot like ag commissioner\nThere is it's a big ballot it's a big ballot this time and you need to get out and make sure you vote and you need to call us right now with your thoughts about all of the politics that's floating around the state as we lead up to November six five four nine to nine three seven to join us five for nine to nine three seven okay\nWe will talk about that race in a moment the ag commissioner race but I Know you want to lead off with what you've got at the top of the pool\nThe governor's race Andrew Gillum Enron dissent is you have new numbers out hot off the presses just this morning they were environment until right now or from your vaunted polling shop on the U. N. F. campus Mike bender what does the polls show we\nHave Andrew Gillum up six points on forty nine I'm forty three over on the sand is with seven percent still and I don't know column haven't quite do figured it out just yet\nA six point lead for gallon six point lead for them to do to solid lead as outside the margin of error it comports with or some other polling that's been done recently and and the real action or easing the MBA category ... others the non partisan a that's really where a killings making some headway\nYou sing independence break for Gillum heavily heavily and do you have any deeper data to show what's driving that support for him among non party affiliated voters\n... we didn't go to deep into why they're feeling that way but I but I think if you look around at the country uh NBA disapprove of Trump and greater numbers to sentence was tied heavily to Trump\nOr give them a how has charisma about him that I think I take attracts people if you could watch the last couple of debates I'm not sure that dissent just came across as well to the NBA's certainly to his base absolutely use adored a book but beyond that I I think he's having trouble reaching some folks in Florida\nIt's fine for nine to nine three seven let us know who will get your vote for governor senator ag commissioner and more as we talk about the latest poll out this week from you and ask Mike bender okay and in Florida it's fascinating to watch how this voting bloc goes Mike because it's one third of the state is one third\nIt's a third of the state but the problem is there to mid term election your is not going to be twenty percent of the electorate so this is a turnout type of race if you can get your base out there you're you're much better shape but those twenty percent do comic they break heavily for one candidate or the other it will absolutely impacted\nFlorida is such a nice such kind of state it's so purple that uh these candidates have to try to run up their margins a little bit in one county run up their merchants than just a touch in another county it's all about the margins isn't it\nIt's about the margins and and it's mass to change dramatically twenty sixteen or the the idea that you could win a little here and a little there and get their was flipped on its head when Trump won enormously in the excerpts than in the wake county's\nAnd Hillary Clinton won enormously and some of the heavier urban counties ... if you looked at just the urban counties you thought wow Hillary Clinton's run away with this but then you looked at some of those other towns likeable Lucia and some of the counties in the panhandle where Trump was when he was eighty plus percent I mean those are the types of numbers at the sand is just going to have to match to to make\nReally wants to Santa says play now looking at these numbers how does he tried to close this cap and then what's what's killings strategy for the ...\nAs a way to kill the offshore drilling idea I\nDon't know the answer to that but the more options you have on there if you have somebody that supports warm down there are more inclined to vote no on it to prevent it from happening but Republicans are opposed to this overwhelmingly overwhelmingly button book by a margin and it's no it's only point forty eight percent to get to sixty is is very unlikely\nThat so the ... the measure then to ban offshore drilling off Florida's coast according to your numbers\nIt does not look hopeful at this time I I Would I Would say no okay are you also polled on the president's job approval in Florida and forty five percent of likely voters approve of Donald Trump's fifty one percent in Florida disapproves\nYeah and Trump has done well in Florida he won Florida he's always had an and I I hate to say this but forty five percent a decent approval rating for Donald Trump in the grand scheme of things that might not be but when you take it to what Trump's approval rating is nationally and in some other states\nForty five percent is a bat fifty one percent disapprove which if you're a Republican has to make you nervous when you hear all these potential voters talking about how the national stage is impacting her vote choices in Florida a book about forty five is a terrible it's not thirty five\nNow one final question ... as you've noted this race has become so nationalized these the statewide races and even some of the local races and the ballot amendments just in the last few\nDays we've had a series of staggering national events and tragedies we've had the apprehension of the pipe bomb suspect in South Florida we had the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh a there was another shooting at a Kroger and Kentucky there a is continued uh\nUh you know outrage over for a a caravan of migrants coming from Central America towards the southern border there are so many factors that have\nUh just with America up into this stew of unease and did this and is an anger and with one week to go something else conceivably could happen to further blow up this election\nAll true um but if you think about all those things that have happened and it seems like every day there's something new the\nAttention span for American is so short yeah and do lanes in which you view these events having occurred to show tinted that I don't necessarily think that is going impacting obviously you're nine eleven type tragedy might change everything but outside of that I don't think these have much impact\nLet's take one more call from Mike bender of you and ask public opinion research lab it's Melissa in Atlantic ... Melissa you're on the air go ahead Melissa\nHi yes I'm I just want to ask a question about the uh\nThe between Gillum\nEnded Sanchez and how they feel about education and I'm from we reading on Gillum website it said that she would like to hold private schools that were the vouchers accountable and also charter schools accountable more accountability but he doesn't really flush out how he's going to do that\nSo I was wondering if you guys could possibly address Saturday you have any additional information about how he could possibly go about doing that [noise]\nRight thanks for the call Melissa and I think what he's referring to a\nIs a trying to get to schools that receive those voucher funds are charter funds to be held at the same ... as a public school in terms of testing and rating I think that's what he's referring to\nWrite and then there's an argument to be made a certainly folks on the left are looking at the mine is being poured into this charter school\nThat I wouldn't want a public tax dollars are as having taking away from the public schools and weakening them and doing so without much oversight or so so their argument relapses hey we need oversight we'd we'd get if you expect public schools performer expect these schools to perform as well and\nListen to some of these charter schools are fantastic some of them are not and and and they're out of business midway through the school year and your kids love painting or enters a lot of problems with some of those so those are all things started to kind of keep in mind\nRight ah and certainly I Would encourage everyone to go to the candidates website I Would encourage everyone is researching all the issues to go to I Would say the league of women voters usually has a really good break down on the ballot amendment and the major candidates and the major issues\nUh that's one you can also go to our website at W.

N. F. campus and he's on the line doctor Vitale thanks for being with us\nYou bet the morning\nYou know a couple of years ago I interviewed and author named Hannah Rose and she wrote a book called the end of men [laughter]\nAnd ... she was saying I Want to end men but ah she was making some interesting arguments in her book I I I think it's fair to say you're not calling for the end of policing but a dramatic change in a policing is that accurate\nI think I'm trying to signal a couple of things one is that we we can think of the end of leaking in terms of like ends and means like what is really the purpose and function of policing\nBut also trying to signal that ah the policing is not really the appropriate solution to so many problems that we handed over to them and that instead of trying to tinkering with with how policing is done we should be asking whether or not we should be really using police thing\nWhat would you say though to those who are here will we we have to have police to maintain some kind of a community cohesion uh maintain a nation of of laws or deter criminal behavior et cetera\nWell that's a huge range of things first of all if you look at at well the suburban communities police\nThere've been many books written about the Emmett Till case especially recently but a new book by historian Eliot Jay born reminds us of the effort to to keep tells case before the public book critic Marine Corps again has a review\nLet the people see what they did to my boy those were the words spoken by Emmett Till's mother made me till Mobley after reviewing the brutalized body of her son\nDuring his night of torture near the delta town of money Mississippi fourteen year old Emmett Till's right I had been dislodged from its socket his tongue choked out of his mouth the back of his skull crushed and his head penetrated by a bullet\nAt the insistence of his family Till's body was shipped back home for burial in Chicago and Mimi till Mobley specifically called for an open casket\nDay and night over Labor Day weekend in Nineteen fifty five over one hundred thousand mourners almost all of them African American filed past\nThat open casket which lay in state in the south side church\nBefore the funeral service a staff photographer from jet magazine was permitted to photograph Emmett Till's body and those images were disseminated to other African American magazines and newspapers including the Chicago Defender\nBut as a historian Eliot jade Goran tells us in his new book on the Emmett Till case the mainstream press didn't reprint those photographs and of course they were considered too graphic for television\nYears later corn says many white Americans remembered falsely remembered the epiphany of Till's ruin face in Nineteen fifty five\nBut few white people saw the photos until Thirty years later when the documentary eyes on the prize opened with the Emmett Till story\nOnly then did his mother's words let the people see what they did to my boy begin to be fully realized\nGordon's book is called let the people see\nLike Timothy be Tyson's twenty seven teen book\nThe blood of Emmett Till it builds on new evidence discovered by the FBI in two thousand and five\nTo present a detailed reconstruction of pills kidnapping and killing in Mississippi in retaliation for allegedly having whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant\nGore and also dives deep into a legal analysis of the transcripts of the trial in the town of Sumner, Mississippi in which Bryant's husband and his half brother were tried for Till's murder\nBoth men were quickly acquitted by an all white all male jewelry but what's most interesting about ... book is his final section called memory in which he traces how ... story which seems so well known today came very close to passing into oblivion\nCorn points out that in the two years following Till's murder more than three thousand articles about him were published\nThen the whole of the Nineteen sixties brought only three hundred articles in the Nineteen seventies fewer than fifty stories appeared\nJustice disturbing is the fact that some of those stories including one written in Nineteen fifty six by William Faulkner for Harper's Magazine relied on a paid interview with the two alleged killers that had been published in look magazine\nThat look story characterized Emmett Till as a defiant sexual aggressor\nGoing forward corn says the tenth and twenty fifth anniversaries of Till's murder mostly passed on observed even in the black press\nIt was the rise of African American studies that helped to recover Emmett Till's story along with the widespread popularity of the Nineteen Seventy seven t._v. serial roots which proved there was a mainstream market for black history\nIn Nineteen eighty five a Chicago reporter named rich Samuels", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Coast Connect With Melissa Ross", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "30"}
