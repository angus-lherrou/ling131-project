J. C. T. F. M. Jacksonville your community your world\n[noise]\nRent tied in circles the Florida peninsula healthcare education and taxes and the governor's race plus mail in ballots go out in a matter of days and early voting starts in just two weeks this is the Ford\nAround them from W well or in public media in Miami and W. J. C. G. public broadcasting in Jacksonville I'm Tom Hudson\nAnd I'm Melissa Ross just ahead we speak with democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum about everything from health insurance to paying teachers fifty thousand dollars a year also Republican run to Santa's goes after Gillum on taxes and\nThe first debate between governor Rick Scott and Senator Bill Nelson turns nasty will it turn off voters\nLots to talk about this week in the sunshine state throughout the peninsula join the conversation three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred or on Twitter at Ford around us it's all up after the news [noise]\nA Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage or Amazon by the way just came out and said they will be paying their employees that how do you propose to pay for these initiatives\nYeah well on on teachers um well we have laid out as a plan that would um make the corporate tax rate in the state of Florida comparable to that of our neighbors in Georgia and Alabama I'm a with a third largest state all of America and uh\nIf is is that in order to educate our kids right now the for the education system is ranked about forty is out of fifty thing quality are teachers on average\nMake an average salary that is the forty fifth lowest out of fifty states with the third largest state in America\nThe question is is is is how is it that we're gonna continue to compete not only\nA across the the the fifty states but across the you know the ... the the world\nUh considering that we live in a global economy we have got to develop the future workforce and invest in our next generation not only leaders but our next generation entrepreneur is a innovators I'm On the corporate tax rate only three percent of companies in the state of Florida pay the corporate tax rate or we're not asking to expand that in fact\nUndermined minister ration uh companies will pay less\nOver my ten year than they paid under Rick Scott's tenure\nWas simply saying is that if we're going to produce the workforce that we need we've got to ensure that we're paying teachers what they're worth\nThat we're investing in our kids and that we really infused back into our public education system the kind of skills training that used to exist while I while college worked for me for my older brothers was woodwork shop mechanical electrical technical programs all of that ah allow those folks to get a skill that they could monetize go to work and get a good job\nAnd we basically exhausted that written large across the uh public education system creating only these special programs for a few when we know that roughly half our kids on on their way to community college university and we got to support them\nLet me ask you about the fifty thousand dollar teacher pay initiative that you have is that across the board and would that be mandated by the state in other words it would be a policy that would be a set forth in Tallahassee for local school boards to have to follow in would that fifty thousand dollars to be the same and Deval county where my colleague isn't the same in Miami Dade County where I Am\nWell the dollar menus the same and both those counties I'm at and we all face and affordable housing crisis in both those counties in the counties all across the state to include rural areas of our state\nUm what I Would say is we're going to work with the sixty seven counties on to make sure that we have a sustainable plan for increasing a teacher salaries are too above the national average\nSo it's not so we're not require the school districts to do\nWhen we are not going to disrupt what is a very active bargaining\nAre between the teachers are organized teachers' union in the school board so we can't disrupt that process\nIs one that's in place in well established but what we're setting is a North Star for where we want to go as a state and what we're simply saying to our policy is Florida can be better than average of ... at least needs to be at average when it comes to teacher pay but we can be better than average teachers should not spend their time mood lighting\nUp between being retail workers at night and then teaching our kids in the daytime it used to be an honorable middle class profession\nAnd we have slowly but surely a remove that distinction and designation from teachers and now we're having a hard time recruiting teachers and to this state\nA A N and maintaining the within the profession the way that I had the same teacher that my brother's before me had and and and and the older ones before that had because we're losing many of these dedicated committed professionals because they can't afford it anymore\nAnd let me ask you about healthcare mayor Gillum or\nYou have a set on the campaign trail and on television and new ads that you believe that health care is a right not a privilege you've called for a expanding Medicaid for more than eight hundred thousand Florida residents you want protections for pre existing conditions\nAre in the area of health care\nOr the contrast between you and your opponent run to Santa seems the darkest\nYou have charged her opponent a mystery to send us with seeking to end protections for patients with pre existing conditions he's pushed back on that accusation\nA how well you work with the legislature to expand Medicaid or and and expand healthcare coverage in Florida given that if you are elected governor you'll be working with a pretty conservative legislature\nYeah I'm simply going to ask the legislature to do the bidding of the people of the state of Florida not special interests are not big insurers of a one in five people in our state are terrified of getting sick\nThey fear that one illness and they put them in the poor house in bankruptcy and I'm not just talking about working poor\nI'm Talking about middle class families who get up every day to get out there and provide for themselves and their families I'm Talking about small business owners who are finding it extremely difficult to provide full coverage for their employees because of the the the the rising cost\nAnd so what we've said is that if we expand access to health care for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in our state\nOr we will pull down six billion dollars from the federal government that right now is being distributed to other states because Florida has decided to put our heads in the sand when it comes to expanding access to a to Medicaid not only is it important to expand access for those who are uninsured one in five people in our state\nBut it's also important for small business owners and those of us who do have insurance because when we look at our premium increases year over year over year they're increasing without protection because the system has to pay for his self one way or another\nAnd right now those uninsured or getting access to emergency rooms which is the most expensive and least efficient form of care I Am not accusing my opponent if anything that he himself has not said or done\nUm I don't believe in and and and and and being dishonest and the course of these races is my opponent who voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act repeatedly and joined an obstructionist wing of the Republican Party in Congress to do so as my opponent who said the reason why we don't have to provide health care for all this because everybody has access to an emergency room\nIt is my opponent who was advocated for re ... uh requiring um I'm I'm a insurance companies not to have to cover people with preexisting conditions\nAnd let me ask you about that point Mr Mayor would you support a or advocate or or or lobby the legislature if elected for a state law in Florida that requires health insurance companies to cover pre existing ...\nAbsolutely it is it is the federal status quo and not to be the status quo here in the state of Florida cancer patients\nFolks with diabetes um even age in some cases and in the state of Florida a pregnant woman is a pre existing condition who among us would believe that you should be able to discriminate\nUh coverage for those individuals are simply because of of of those conditions I mean Americans by and large all come to the table with some form of of of of of of health issues and so we can't go back to where we once were that's what we've actually tried to eradicate from the system there isn't that kind of ramp and help to syringe\nIndividual mandate anymore for the Affordable CARE Act would you like to have an individual mandate in the state of Florida\nLess than I think we've got to move as many people into the pool as possible to include a healthy is as well as the sick is in that pool we have to share the low\nLow what'd you mandated than require Floridians to have health insurance is what\nI'm going to require is that we work with the legislature to expand Medicaid are and what we want to do work with our insurance companies to ensure more people um that is unacceptable for Fifteen Percent of the people in this day not to have access to health care as governor I Will work diligently to expand access\nMayor Gillum uh let me ask you a strategy question are you surprised a lot of people in the primary uh expanding the Democratic side of the electorate I'm putting together a coalition that seem to recall the Obama coalition that won the state twice\nOr the other day you campaigned in ... a ... and serve it if corner of Florida and drew a huge crowd are pretty big crowd for ... for a democratic candidate\nThat are caught a lot of eyeballs\nUm but ... ... ... what is the challenge though for you going into November to turn out voters\nA given that your opponent or Mr dissent is is going to have a very motivated base as well uh yeah turn out voters and the latest polling in this race shows the two of you essentially tied and so not only is everyone in Florida watching this race the eyes of the nation are on this race so uh how\nDo you plan to go forward between now and election day to turn out not only base democratic voters that how how do you\nA after the socialist tag didn't seem to work\nUm the Santa says while Andrew Gillum is going to be the Democratic governor that is going to Institute the state income tax changes the bogeyman Republicans have played over and over again which promptly cause Andrew Gillum very next day to say no such thing there will be no state income tax and democratic governor\nAnd we heard it and I think the first part of this interview you have an Andrew Gillum a confident a job in the poll driven because the poll suggesting every single one he is a head he's sounding like a front runner he's running like a front runner\nAnd I think in this stage of the campaign thus far you see the dynamics that work for the first time the Democrats unlike in years past really seem to have\nA great degree of wind that they're back going forward\nWe got a lot of calls coming in about Florida issues especially red tide water quality the environment will get to those calls in a moment but Makin front and I want you to ah to talk about the impact of what has happened today on this Friday the cloture vote in the United States Senate regarding a judge Brett Kavanaugh's\nNomination to the United States Supreme court obviously a federal issue a but how does that affect the non party affiliated voter the one at every three voters in the state of Florida what the ground game that is necessary to get to win in November ... about it\n[noise] I don't I'm\nI'm a little ambivalent about the impact of ah the Kavanaugh comp a confirmation fight in a perverse way I think that ah when you're talking about intensity and you're talking about in turn out\nI think that if a Kevin has confirmed goes into appears he will be that the anger just people will be Democrats and um and it might increase their intent should fail the angry people will be Republicans and it might increase their\nUm intensity and turn out\nFor a project my cell phone to this I you know I'm as everyone knows I loathe Donald Trump I think he's a clear and present danger to American democracy\nBut the chairman of fight has placed me any unconventional an uncomfortable position\nOf being on the same side of him for the first time and I think if you\nLook at Bill Kristol and you know a lot of never Trump or around the country has had a similar effect now whether this will be important at the polls are I don't know but what Dianne Feinstein and the others on the committee and their allies in the press have done is reminded\nThose of us who were focused on Trump and his defects about why we don't like Democrat\nFernandez is excite either the bases anymore in Florida than they already were excited\nYou know I don't believe so ... simply because here in Florida when you look at how the senators are voting Rubio was voting along party lines on this as is Nelson it's not like in a perhaps West Virginia or main when the Collins and mentioned votes might go opposite to what their parties are going to be doing that there may be an impact and and look I hate to be cynical about this but\nIt looks like Kavanaugh will be confirmed tomorrow which would be all October six and we're talking about what the election if the on November ... days from now when a new cycle last twenty five minutes and Trump's America so I I think the the residents won't be as much a month from now as as folks from like\nThe guy with us today and if you are getting in on the yeah and you agree with that Mac or at least agree we\nGo about this time next week nobody will probably remember who Kevin O's because Donald Trump will move the carrier task force\nWas through Iran or something [laughter] who can predict right if you're just tuning in Florida\nRound up is live from way down at the bottom of the Florida peninsula we're live through the eyes for court or\nUp in North Florida in Jacksonville over a west of us in Gainesville we are taking calls all around the state right now at three o five nine nine five Eighteen hundred as we talk about this tight governor's race between Andrew Gillum and Ron descendants with strategist Mac ... and for non uh Monday\nLet's go to Bianca in Stewart she says she's a single issue voter Bianco what's your big issue\nMy big issue is the river quality I live in a store and I'm right on the Indian River lagoon and\nMy I grew up on the water might twenty eight year old sister had breast cancer along with Martin County having the highest breast cancer and rape and the whole state and now I have a son who every time I take him to the pediatrician and they asked me\nHas he been exposed to the river I just don't understand how we live in a state\nSurrounded by water and we can't go near our beaches are close our children are getting sick by breathing in our dog they're dying by drinking water I'm just appalled and that will be my single issue voters I'm voting Democrat and Republican whoever is putting the issue first I don't care\nAnd who and who do you see is putting the issue first\nOriginally I really kind of thought that this and it was really putting that out there he would put that first he would say that that that ... what he wants to do ... Guillen is saying that as well but and I hear is the thing that because more and more people are saying that that's important to them\nI don't know and kind of leaning more towards the stand is on the governor's side I'm Brian ... is amazing he is really fighting for that\nAnd the mayor congressman there you know your congressman they're okay I got yeah thank you for that so Fernando Mac for non let's start with you\nThese candidates are going after these voters who care so much about this issue\nWater in Florida whether it's river quality or the red tide that is looking shaping up to be one of the defining issues of this cycle which candidate can win the day on the issue of the environment because in this state the environment is the economy for non let's start with\nYou well you know once again to the point that a Mac and I made earlier given the fact that the Republicans own every single issue in Florida for better or for worse I think\nBoth Ron descent and ... and in the case of the spillover effect to the U.S Senate race Rick Scott or on the wrong side of these issues we also see beaches literally being closed down all across the state of Florida\nNothing gets the goat of voters when they try and do the Florida thinks that they love to do fast and can't do it because of problems that a lot of people end up I think correctly assigning to a government mismanagement so in this case I Would hate to be the Republican of any contest having to defend the states environmental record right now\n... that the disadvantages as first policy or on issues that came out the first one was on the environment wasn't the economy wasn't jobs was in taxes was into you know business development at the first issue paper out from the ... campaign a few weeks ago was the environment\nYeah it's it's his best chance to distinguish himself I'm from the past Twenty years and to I'm trying to\nGenerate some excitement it's kind of interesting um his criticisms on these issues or implicitly of criticism of ah the Republican dominated legislature and governor Scott's a\nEight years in office these but these are ... and both guys I mean\nAnd I I should say by the way I'm In the interest of full disclosure one of my clients as the United states sugar corporation so I'm very very familiar with this issues and both of these guys are\nAre in full cry I mean uh you know Andrews a lieutenant governor running mate is Chris King and the environment the Everglades restoration discharges from the lake we're the centerpiece of his campaign is not the only thing in his campaign and the census himself has taken a similar\nPosition how this is a problem that requires a lot of money and a lot of time uh most of it comes from septic tanks and that sort of thing you know what the senators program if you look at it is what we're doing building a new reservoir south of the lake\nOr repairing the dyke so I don't know who comes out on top on this but we're not as probably right the Democratic probably get the edge on this because they haven't been in charge\nLet's get a call in from Jacksonville Janet also wants to talk about the environment Janet go ahead you're on the radio\n[noise] yes um I think there can be a lot of rhetoric about the environment and on a Santa is Haitian on various holy though but let's look at what he actually did a while serving in the U. S. how\nAccording to the league of conservation voters and every year they score\nCard [laughter] I had a positive and negative votes on environmental a bill ... who died that will lead in del\n... voted against the environment Ninety eight percent of the time during his term in office as as that US Congressman that tells alive summarizes it all up that war is coming from\nYeah jam himself grain ... even\n... that'll be up to Florida voters let me remind folks that you are listening to the floor to round up from Florida public radio\nMac I heard you giggle at that uh environmental a rating record there are by congressman dissent is uh is he running away from that record as he was trying to become a bit of a green candidate to and not take sugar money for instance in the uh run for the governor's office\nWell nobody in this race is I'm taking money from um", "show_name": "First Coast Connect With Melissa Ross", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "06"}
