University in Philadelphia and I worked my first four years as a public defender and Bronx New York so\nAnd who will be your opponent in that circuit who who currently hold that position\nCurrently a

morning to you\nI morning show I have served and I haven't run in a different she um but I was wondering how long someone like me who has experience running for office ensuring help others\nYou don't want to run this this cycle yourself you just want to help other women sure [noise] I Am\nYeah and in Iran in it I I ran in Alaska in Florida but I'm Wondering how as as a woman who has gone through this I can use my experience to help others that are interested in\nSofia your thoughts\nCorrection that it's actually a great question and first of all thank you so much for supporting the mission of more women running for office I think based on your experience something that would be incredibly valuable as a mentor other women in your community mentor even just one woman that you know would be an incredible\nUh elected official\nAnd help them navigate that process uh that that is definitely one way I definitely share your experiences uh with other women because the more that we share what it's like to run for office the more we can mystified that process and make it more possible for other women to step up and lead\nAnd can you argue that someone who is a word can your nation help connect me to someone that can help mentor [noise]\nOh great question so we are looking and twenty ninth team to launch a mentor ship program so if you do go to our website and sign up to receive updates we definitely can make sure that you get that information [noise] great\nEnergy grants and thanks for the call a Sophia providing that network of mentors and sponsors was so important because of course men have always been able to top\nWhat some might call the good old boy network but you know it's just a network of men and powerful positions women have had a harder time with that and so you're you're really working to create that sort of network aren't you\n[noise] definitely definitely we want to make sure that\nThe women that currently are in office or have held elected office are able to easily share their experiences with women that are aspiring to run for office\nAnd lots of calls as we talk with she should run if you're thinking about running for office you're a woman out there you need to go to she should run dot org by midnight friday and applied to be part of their November incubator a training session that they're going to hold in Jacksonville to train you to run for office\nLisa is on the north side Lisa good morning\nHey Melissa I'm at one point that's really important to make is why why it's important that women ... or more often in public office\nWe developed a parent court that we do have for free on our website she should run dot org a parent's course that you can use that curriculum with your young girl as so that there's really great conversation starter and activities to help start that conversation about\nTheir leadership and hope hopefully and firing them to to run for office someday\nAnd as we speak with Sophia per era\nOf she should run give us a call if you're thinking of running for office or if you just think more women should run for office five for nine to nine three seven you know a recent analysis by Reuters Sophia found that\nAfter November we could see an all time high of the number of women in our state legislators legislatures rather about forty percent if the\nThe majority of the women running when those contests so that's remarkable to because women have always been underrepresented in state legislatures\nThat wouldn't get us to fifty percent but it would get us a lot closer than where we are now let me ask you as well with the Kavanaugh hearings playing out just so much intensity and closely watched uh and so divisive\nThan the whole issue of abortion and roe versus Wade how how much do you see that as motivating women to run for office the cycle\nI think it's getting very for the woman that's running for office like I mentioned before you know we have women from all different backgrounds that\nAre pursuing elected office and they are going to be different issues that drives them at so that is definitely going to be one of them but that's not going to be the only issue that a woman is going to be stepping up to run in their community most of the women we work with\nAre thinking about running at at the local level on and son at the state level as well\nSo there are going to just a variety of reasons that women are stepping up to run but I think the universal theme of why so many more women are running for office is women recognizing the value that they can bring that decision making table so whatever the issue comes before them that they are going to be able to bring\nA different perspective and hopefully produce better policy outcomes because of that\nWell again the the

keynote at this event what are you going to be talking about\nWell I Will be a ... inspired by the by the theme that that the policy center's already chosen hope that something we do and I think it's important for us to talk about that now because it's very easy for us to think of hope at some sort of um [noise] a fence supple wish\nAnd I think as a culture when we start to look at ourselves when we look at the whole stories of people around us we start to find ways that we can contribute\nTo healing when we talk about hope we'll be talking about particular you know particular skills what can we do other than wish things were better how do we get involved in creating healing and reconciliation I'm\nIn the places where we are hurting the most and I think given all that we're seeing right now we could see that there's\nArt everywhere right now so many of the systems that we've relied on to work aren't working very well at all so it is for us I believed to try to create space is a sanity and gentleness and bravery and healing\nSo that we can create the kind of world that we want to be a part of and that we want to leave us a legacy to the our young people\n... she's right in that this nation is hurting right now the country is just the raw wound at the moment particularly around the topic of\nSexual abuse sexual assault\nThe Supreme Court confirmation hearings have expose these deep fault lines in our society\nAnd with the me too and the time's up movement really cresting right now\nWomen and girls are insisting that their experiences be validated that they be heard that uh people take them seriously when they talk about ah being assaulted\nAt the same time we have the president of the United states saying no it's the mothers of sons that should be worried if they're if they're boys are falsely accused\nAnd so you know I was thinking about this as you were preparing to come in here and talk about this today because you advocate for girls and so we need to be very clear about that you are here to advocate for girls who have been traumatized\nHow do you how do you get this message out in this kind of political climate um it it's really really\nDismaying to see where we are as a country right now when it comes to us\nIt is very disheartening and I think more than ever it's why the summit is so important\nThat hope is what we do and bringing Dr Walker to help us to find the skills that we need to be able to have dialogue in conversation in our community to also hear each other to hear both sides of this issue while\nAt the same time knowing that we have a ethical responsibility to model for our children what it is that we won the world to be and more than ever that's why this summit is so important\nWhat will people learn when they come to this and and who's ... who were you hoping comes by the way Vicki\nSo we are really hoping it's open to everybody it's open to both men and women service providers community members um we really are hoping that anybody that is um that have girls in their lives will attend the summit and we have that\nMany tracks available so it's open to anybody that's interested in learning about the research around this we have a track at focused\nOn media and I know that you will be um a panelists so we're excited to have you attend and participate in this year\nWe also will have one that specifically focused on those that provide services and so both Luanda and I will also be I'm presenting and I'm also it's really about providing tools so that individuals can walk away and having\nTools on how to start shifting conversations having tools on how to start doing the work with girls differently\nSo that we can respond differently in our community to the needs of girls\nOr the whole trauma informed uh\nCare movement that that's a big part of what you do is in it and as I was listening to NPR on the way and to work this morning and listening about the FBI investigation into\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh um that is not what is going to take place with this FBI investigation that is not how they operate but increasingly in the criminal justice system organizations like yours are nudging the system to to operate more that way\nRight we are and we're also advocating for even a deeper perspective that moved beyond trauma informed care\nTo healing centered communities\nThat really recognizes what needs to shift in our community to create safe spaces and healing places for young people and particularly girls and young women to find a sanctuary or healing can take place and we can shift from blaming and shaming\nTo actually providing those resources and support that are needed to heal from the trauma\nAnd you're talking primarily about sexual violence right we are talking about sexual violent girl enraged and sexually abused\nWe are we work with young women who have experiences of sexual abuse sexual exploitation sex trafficking and we know that the pathway to the justice system is really paid by that exploitation and once they are in the system they are reach traumatized and re victimized\nLet's go to your calls about the the the girl summit five for nine to nine three seven Fred is in Jacksonville Hi Fred good morning\nI have a couple of questions\nThat first one so I guess we want to help them a lot\nBut what about the guys like myself I have a lot of issues of a\nSexual abuse of children mhm and what do they do much for us\nYeah yeah thanks for that Fred and I appreciate the call 'em you know I think the correct me if I'm wrong ladies one and for young women will be sexually assaulted one in six young men so this is a problem for boys to not as big a problem but it's out there\nVicky I'm\nAbsolutely we recognize that this is just as big of an issue\nAnd just as impact so I'm On men as it is on women and while the Policy Center is focused on women there are other organizations that are\nFocused on boys and men and so um our mission is specifically girls and young women and um\nBut recognizing that as we shift\nThe world for girls and women we also see the ripple effect and how the world changes for men and young boys as well and we see that in our research\nOn in schools and communities that as we've list the voices of girls we also see that we start to see better treatment of boys\nUm but we also recognize oh\nI'm so when we\nStart seeing conversations and interactions and treatment programs and\nTherapeutic mode allergies all shifting for girls recognizing that we need to move like I'm Dr Weaver aside from trauma informed to healing center of communities\nThat also means that the work needs to look different for boys and it means that we need to look beyond the trauma we need to look at the fact that the individual was strong enough\nThat had they had and they had strings they had resiliency that their story was beyond just that moment of that experience um\nAnd so this whole ... story this whole experience is what they are today and when you start looking at the person as a whole human being you\nRecognize that they're feeling is about the whole human being and about the whole story and so if

but the culture itself perpetrate violence\nAnd I think that is one way that we can get away from the kind of wrote some thinking that some of us have heard about early this morning where do we get the feeling of girls against the healing of boys\nI think when we look at the ways that the culture marginalize this people when they said this is how this is what you have to do this is all you have to behave in order to be of value or valuable person\nW.

Florida coastal holding company had filed three lawsuits in federal court against the American bar association\nAfter the a BA found that in floods three law schools one in Charlotte one in Arizona and one here in Jacksonville we're out of compliance with their admission and accreditation standards\nFlorida coastal remains accredited and is not on probation however\nCharlotte school of law closed in August and Arizona summits accreditation was rescinded in June by the a BA\nSo what's Florida coastal doing rights well here with more we welcome dean Scott DeVito and Jennifer ... dean of academics both with Florida coastal school of law good morning good morning\nAnd let's begin with the good news congratulations on the news scores that's got to be a nice change a\nYou know to be able to report something positive because there have been some issues lately at at info law so what do you attribute the new scores to\nWell I think there's a couple of different things and uh I'd actually like to turn it over to dean rubber 'cause she's really the engine I think for a lot of these these changes\nSo for the ... we are very proud of our results we were sixty two percent an estate both in February and July we were ranked fourth and then seven\nAnd we are with in this state average by if you point which is highly significant that\nThe biggest thing that we did is is when we have to think our faculty our faculty implemented a lot of changes with us and was very supportive of our students and we also started some new bar prep classes and in doing those and in changing the way we helped our students approached material and approached the bar exam\nWe've really seen some very very positive results\nIn fact one of the things we are most proud of is even though we continue to raise our missions credentials cents at twenty sixteen\nThe student you took the bar this year I had the same entering credentials as those and twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen when our results were not what we wanted them to be so we're very proud of the fact that through our curriculum and are amazing faculty and our prep class it we've really been able to pull up our results and I will tell you we are the only law school in the state of Florida\nWho from Seventeen or Eighteen at each our our results raised each time\nCongratulations that's great and and for the coastal has always had the mission of uh opening up law school to students that might not be able to afford another uh\nInstitution or making it more accessible getting students practice ready when they graduate I'm so dean DeVito that has been at the school's reputation for a long time\nCan you bring us up to date though on where you stand with the American bar association because that has there's been some back and forth about that\nYes so the American bar association found us out of compliance with three standards real won a thriller nine be and five oh one B.\nAnd we've been working with them to convince them that we actually are in compliance on those standard we believe are in compliance but they found that we're not\nSo this is what happens next is they're going to want to see some solid results from us and just some history from us I think that's the next six months or will be providing them this information about our results about improved entering credentials and continuing to build that\nConnection with the ADA so that they feel comfortable that where where we need to be\nYou're in a better place than uh your sister schools that are under the umbrella of the holding company in ... the school in Charlotte closed actually closed the school in Arizona run by until I had an its accreditation recent it what what mistakes did they make a that I guess Florida coastal has not made\nI think the primary thing that we've done that was different was that we started making changes a little bit earlier than the other two schools for Charlotte I think they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and the actions that the department of education to were very dramatic and drastic and to be if they're completely out of the ordinary\nAbove tend to be mean out of the ordinary was very rare for the department of education to move in and remove someone's titled for funding\nWhen at the first point at which they're creditors said we're worried about you and that's what happened to Charlotte school of law and they were just never able to recover from that as a consequence we're not in any position where we would be put in that that scenario\nBut our movement to raise entering credentials are real drive to ensure that our students do graduate practice ready and able to pass the bar I think we just started that a little bit earlier and as a result we're getting the benefit of that outcome\nOkay um so dean ... um for students that have been watching all of this and maybe might have hesitated to consider Florida coastal school of law what's your message for those perspective law student\nI messages come join us he will pass the bar on the first time you will be ready to practice law in this community or whatever community you want to go home to our make your

I'm a professor who has been on your show many times and does great work in the immigration and the family law arena professor ... um we have a lot of opportunities that coastal and so we are happy to
