E. A. remember\nWhen that uh became a huge matter of discussion\nWell if this passes the straw ballot measure which is the last thing on your November ballot unless you're in Atlantic beach then I think it's the second to last item that's what it's actually tell the city council that voters want to have a say in any sale of more than ten percent of J. E. A. now this is non binding but it is your chance to have your voice heard\nThe measure was created by John crescent Benny at large city councilman group to and chair of the Nineteen members special committee on Jay ... potential sale he joins us now ... good to see you like for having me could see I'm also and\nHere's our question to callers\nHow do you plan to vote on this measure the straw ballot measure over the future of J. E. A. give us a call with your thoughts and questions at five for nine to nine three seven that's five for nine to nine three seven okay\nThis is not the first time by the way that the city council has held discussions about selling ... but it went further than it ever had before last year or earlier this year is that what prompted you to push for the straw ballot measure\nIt did this uh this is the third discussion that the council's had the first to want occurred in two thousand and seven the second occurred in two thousand twelve they were both occurring in times where the city was facing significant revenue shortfalls I think the council members were trying to figure out a way to supplement their budget\nThose discussions were very short lived compared to what happened in twenty eight team this conversation went on for months special committee was convened in ah February we met through we we met weekly through July\nSo it was much more extensive now in two thousand and seven is a citizen of the time I took the position that if\nThe city were ever to contemplate selling Jay\nIt should be a decision by the citizens the voters the shareholders of the utility that's a publicly owned utility not the city council but during this recent discussion this year I learned to interesting provisions in the charter one was that the charter already says that if the board of directors for ... you know he wants to sell more than ten percent of the utility\nThat the terms and conditions without so you'll have to be approved by the city council by a majority vote that's ten out of Nineteen members with another provision in the ... in the charter that deals with ... that says if the council wants to change the charter\nAs it relates to Jay that requires a two thirds vote or Thirteen members of the city council out of Nineteen so I find that very interesting that we can solve a multibillion dollar asset with ten votes but in order to tweak the language and the charter that would take Thirteen boat so\nI introduced legislation to pull the voters on this subject and also introduced a charter change which has been part since the early part of the year and will move forward is this a straw ballot measure is voted on favorably by the public\nSo then ... ... even though this uh weighing in by the voters is not a binding matter this is I guess your way of letting everyone know where you think the voters stand on this\nRight 'cause right now the city council makes the final decision on any potential future so you'll Jay so the voters have a question in front of them that says\nThat if you think you should have that right you should be the final voice than you would vote yes on the straw ballot initiative if you're OK with the city council making the final decision then you should should probably vote no on the measure\nWhy are you against the sale of Jay\nI'm this isn't about whether we are selling ... yeah you're\nNot I know but it but I think it's pretty clear that you and you don't I don't it does not seem as though you're in support of this notion\nI Can't know I'm trying to empower the people to participate in the process so I have no idea what his potential sailed Jay you I Would look like that would be like me asking you would you like to sell your house\nWhat was your answer be I think it would be dependent on what you would sell it for so that's that's a whole 'nother discussion this this exercise is purely to involve the citizens in that decision making process\nNo political theater involved here this is an Enron maybe around mayor Cory who has a seem to be more in favor of this idea\nA lot from my perspective I Can't speak for this was voted on unanimously by the council to do on the November sixth ballot that's not my into a again I took a position in two thousand and seven I wasn't on the city council there was no mayor Cory at the time I just was acting as a citizen and said we need to\nUh put a decision like selling ... in front of the voters it's their utility it doesn't belong to the city council it belongs to every citizen there'll be well county so I think they should be they should hold the the keys to the fate of the utility if if it were ever decided to be sold\nThere was a widespread perception that the mayor might have been a okay with this idea of being floated a that was strong push back the idea that didn't make it for this is a process do\nYou think the mayor will float this idea again perhaps after he's reelected if he's ...\nI can tell you that there are a lot of people I talked to I've been out you know promoting this a straw valid to see packs neighborhood organizations homeowners' associations any any group\nLittle have me and there's a lot of ah folks out in the world I think that this issue's going to come back up after next year's spring elections so\nI I don't know whether it will or won't but if it if it does or doesn't this is a good safeguard going forward in the future so does this conversation does come back up next year we're in ten years or Twenty years the charter will have\nBeen amended to allow the citizens to participate in that final decision about whether or not that you should be sold and what we\nDo before the voters would be whatever deal the board of directors approved\nAnd subsequently went to the couch will be approved by voters could make a determination the voters are smart they've weighed in on pension plan reform they looked at the better Jacksonville plan I mean they know how to drill down through the details of a proposal and determine whether it's right or wrong for the city going forward\nSomething a lot of the people out there may not realize is that having a city on utility first city this size is not really common it is not any more notice my eyes so this is a publicly owned asset whereas so many other cities have gone to waive privatizing these services\nAnd that that's where the controversy came in and the idea that you know J. E. A. might be sold to Florida power light or Duke Energy or some other big player like that ah that's really where are people fell on this issue of whether they liked that idea or not\nI think you're right and I can tell you that ah I've lived in Jacksonville since Nineteen sixty five ah I became a J customer when I moved out of my parents' home in Nineteen eighty I was on the city council for eight years in the nineties and I've been back on the council since two thousand and eight and I thought I knew a lot about the UAE\nAs a citizen as a customer as a council member but I'll tell you what meeting weekly this year uh from February ... July I learned\nThat's a decision for the future and I think that's a decision that voters can handle\nCouncilman John ... always good to see like Washington thanks for being with us much more still had a later it's world stroke day what doctors at Mayo want\nYou to know the signs and symptoms that can uh save your life if you move quickly but up next why PBS NewsHour has its eyes on battleground Florida\nA special show tonight will have a preview\n\nIberia backed backed by over one hundred Thirty years of experience and history Iberia bankers proud to support W.
