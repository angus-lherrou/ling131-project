Dan is we interview the most compelling newsmakers of the first coast [noise] coming up this morning we'll discuss all the\nBiggest stories of the week with our media round table week in review then later Fifteen views of Jacksonville short stories from the old city that and more ahead this hour on first cat can act [noise]\nThe day's news [noise]\nYeah he's he's asking everybody who came out and voted for the president to come out and vote for him um and when we're talking about independent and not party ... voters\nThey're really looking at two very different campaigns right Ron descent as his focused his entire campaign post primary on attacking Andrew Gillum especially now that Susie wild and Tim Baker there are running the consultants\nYeah and Andrew Gillum I mean you know is more or less focused on his own platform um and so I I think with with independent voters um I wouldn't be surprised to see them gravitating toward Gillum more than they do to St is\nAnd is health care the reason why I'm Gillum is campaigning heavily on expanding Medicaid making health care more affordable calling that a bipartisan issue that will bring over moderate voters John Charles\nWill that be a winning message do you think has the ground shifted enough on health care for that to work for a gallon particularly when he taught when he accuses a\nDissent us and the president and Republicans of wanting to take away coverage for pre existing conditions and issues like that is that resonating with voters what are you guys\nThan it was not afraid to put that issue on the table especially with all of the opportunity or the money the funding that was enough on the table by the previous administration or the current administration has to say\nAnd and he's his messages that there's economic development opportunity and the money that's been left on the table for Medicaid expansion so uh is that resume we will find out in November but I'm certainly is something that he's banking on to to help people in the state or understand that this was opportunity for the state\nAnd I'm sitting by the opportunity to go away isn't a good thing\nMaybe as a cop out but he did back it gets back to what Charles Sainz of turn out who it depends on which of those folks on the fence turns out more because clearly a lot of folks supported where we are as a state right now currently mhm so if those folks do turn out and turnout for dissatisfaction\nIn fact that\nMay be the case right now so so that's where we are I mean I think it really will determine how which party can get the most people out to the polls\nSlung you're also seeing Democrats right now written all over Twitter and social media you know saying the same thing about round the sentence that he doesn't have health care plan or that he has not presented to health care policy so you've got Gillum really running with this\nYou know this this whole idea with health care and then there are also pushing back on the St is not even having anything I mean I I Believe he probably does have something but he has not articulated that to voters three weeks out before an election\nNot leaving with that but what he is leading with is Andrew Gillum is too far left for Florida yes he's a socialist right so that now so my question to you then is that a message that will resonate\nI yeah with his base I don't think with independence in ... I think that I only strengthens that only solidifies support from that base that really truly believes that I'm Andrew Gillum is a socialist or not he's going to turn Florida and diminished whale or whatever the talking point is at this point\nAnd I don't know the numbers but when we're talking about turnout they would stand to reason that Democrats have a higher margins forum gaining voters\nBut to to come to the polls so really what you're seeing here is ... and and the Republicans going hard after their base because those are the folks they need to turn out in in in ... when this race\nLet's go to your calls now as we talk about the governor's race here on the friday media roundtable\nBoth Ron ... Santos and Andrew Gillum more in downtown Jacksonville last night who will get your vote five for nine to nine three seven just a couple of weeks to go and early voting starts a week from tomorrow absentee ballots are already coming in so really the election is already\nHappening as we speak or by for nine to nine three seven Tracy is in Mandarin Hi Tracey good morning go ahead\nI only had it and I did it you can take my foot and everybody I think about how they want to thank you\nSo you it's okay so you support him based on the health care health care platform that\nAre you er nurse I Am a doctor\nFor short is headed in good shape and if he is talking about and thinking a lot of money to provide I think he will take many other people ain't no\nThank you okay thanks for that\nIf that's the thing too that there's a very ah they're very different when it comes to the philosophy around health care\nAnd I'm Joe ms pushing the envelope on on how to make health care affordable in the state of Florida when this answers the sand where we have now I was working without pulling down to money from the federal government for points\nAnd then from the Republican side of the ideas we can't pull down the Medicaid money because the feds would pay Ninety percent but Florida would sell them for say ten percent we can't afford that they're at the Republican arguments\nRight in to say this is also pushing the the whole you know how much our taxes going to go up to support this and other things and and that's a that's a very real concern with a lot of folks\nNow and then yes and um and kill him is proposing raising the corporate tax rate he'd like to see teachers get paid fifty thousand dollars a year or he wants criminal justice reform\nOr he campaign last night about amendment for we'll talk about the ballot amendment sentiment um that would restore voting rights to former felons in the state uh\nCourse to Santa's against that on any issue basically you're talking about two candidates who could not be further apart and you couldn't have a stark contrast which way the state's going to go\nNo and and they both represent I think you know the um I don't want to say the extremes of their base but Rhonda Santas is certainly more of a you know a far right conservatism Andrew Gillum is definitely placing himself as the most progressive\nCandidate that we've had you know a serious candidate for governor I'm In and of course you know Gillum supports amendment for I I Believe I'm ... and right now the system with the clemency board is not working I think for most felons\nLet's go to a it's fine for nine to nine three seven let's go to Daryl in St Augustine hey there on the morning [noise]\n... and I'm a registered independent who owns a corporation\nUm ... if I if I stay healthy or I generate a a fifty thousand dollars a year for the government of have a heart attack on this phone call I become a liability and probably cost the government fifty thousand dollars here it is a\nOn a heart attack on this phone call believe I'm\n... now so I'm going to I'm going to vote for Gillum it's only halfway there\nBut you know it's kind of absurd that I spend or give the government all of this money and they can't even you know uh basically changed the oil and my heart or anything else I got to want to pay more for it so I'm going to vote for ... and I'm a registered independent solve that al ...\nYou know that's the way it is and I have a corporation which probably will pay more taxes for\nWell they're all\nI like your turn of phrase or make sure you don't need to change the oil and your heart to make sure you don't wait too long between oil changes right by what they always scientifically last forever yeah Daryl thanks very interesting uh getting this very unscientific feedback from our listeners\nAnd one of the things that may be going on is people have permanent residents and citizens of Florida have seen with is like not to have our Medicaid expansion in their life and the economic impact is having on the state of Florida\nAre with people on the road who don't have health care and this may be a way to you know to civil that score at least try something different if they if they believe that this was an option\nJimmy treats the show it's wrong to paint Gillum as a as a socialist he was a delegate for Hillary Clinton and on her VP short list to Santa's can't support his rhetoric with the fact John Bachmann\nWill just say I'll be watching over the next couple of weeks and written of course on on Tuesday November six is is turnout you know we you know they just started early voting a ... in Georgia\nOr I think it was with the yesterday it was early I mean I I interest rate is very similar to this one to be totally honest and so I I Believe\nAnd they had people lined up for hours in in in places like Cobb County which has historically a very conservative a district area for for the suburb of Atlanta yeah and so um and that's just one spot and you know\nYeah yeah I think you hit it right on the now they're um you know also with Rhonda Santas um he he's certainly going to follow the the trendy party line right now and that is more charter schools are again more school choice Andrew Gillum and are exactly what you just said [laughter]\nWas differences that well we already know school choice those were were in it now we already have school choice we but we haven't done is look they're paying teachers what they deserve\nAnd that's what drew them seems to be proposing in vote is going to have to decide if they want to know or drift to pay to play situation the way going to propose him and so forth that's one of the one of the things that can help with solving our education problem\nWe I mean I think that wherever you fall politically people do agree that our educational system is not\nSatisfying the majority of voters a but it wasn't so maddening is the the extreme contentiousness and the total disagreement about what to do about that and the deadlock just does not seem the logjam has not broken yet in this state or anywhere in the country\nInvolved ... yeah for yeah and I think it's very easy to for everybody to recognize that are K. through twelve our even our even our public university systems are wildly underfunded um but how you know you prioritize those dollars both of these candidates offer a completely different view on that and\nThat is right now if you're just tuning in it's our friday media round table as we welcome John Bachmann of action news David caught and and the daily record and real talk host Charles graves to studio five to talk about the biggest stories of the week the number to join us five for nine to nine three\nSeven now speaking of sports and football\nWe learned this week the Jacksonville Landing might be left out of the party won Florida Georgia comes to town next weekend of course the landing has been the spot to go to for decades when the party ready fans rolling to Jacksonville for the big game but this year they might have to go somewhere else\nThe landing in the city are locked in a bitter legal fight and the city is not yet issued a special events permit for concerts at the landing during game weekend the big game is coming up next weekend on October twenty seventh\nA lot of people may be left to just wander the streets of Jacksonville uh they can come in here and have a drink\n[laughter] that'd be fun [laughter]\n[laughter] well you know the the army's city of around this building in a few days ago and we're we're guy to welcoming them every year\nAnd where they'll go this year is anybody's guess you know ...\nAnd I understand you know the city is wrapped up for those who aren't aware of the city is wrapped up in two lawsuits with the owners of the landing slamming enterprises and uh this is another tactic in that lawsuit I'm saying that you know we're no longer going to since they of since the city in cities view that effected them\nUm they're no longer issuing special event permits but the thing is that they've never require the landing to have special event purpose permits for these type of event it's technically city property I'm\n... and I don't know how productive this is\n... is a punitive yeah ...\nAbsolutely right in the city yeah I mean they can wrap it around whatever dressing language they want to talk about safety or you know the the terrible events that happened earlier this year at the landing but the reality is this is a tactic it as a pressure point that they know that you know they can push\nIt may be one of those situations where\nThere's just want to get their attention as this thing move on you know the the last move forward\nBut I have a few hundred or something is going to happen at the land and you know they're going to be some type of entertainment going on this won't stop the show because mhm that something is always going on that landing whether it matters you know the strength sanctioned by the city or or for profit event something's going to go on out there in ... and I don't think it's going to stop the party\nOr any of that did announce coast one does performing a dailies place after the game so that it was it out because\nOf that yeah they're trying to pull all the ... over this way yeah it's you know you see like what are all the shots\nOf right when the when the TV cameras are on for the game right in the landing it's the party the night before that he is packed it the landing in ... you you see to John's point that the city is trying to move that party\nOver to families place they hold beautiful facility they built over there we'll see what\nWith that and Jay is in the news again this week nine candidates have interviewed to Jacksonville utilities next CEO\nMeanwhile last week Moody's downgraded J. E. A. and the city of Jacksonville debt obligations so unwelcome eyes on J e a a lot of scrutiny and by the way I'm I'm getting a lot of feedback from listeners saying that the process for picking the next CEO has not been transparent enough\nTo the public so they've had um one on one interviews with uh the board of directors individually um and they will continue through I Believe the end of the month and then\nNext month they will have public interviews I Believe with these candidates or you can come and you know it's open to the public I Believe the live stream that as well um and there's a lot of qualified candidates on this list I mean these are\nYou know executives at large you know utility companies people have had a lotta years of experience and errands on\nYeah errands on is the interim CEO Mayer curries handpicked guy when he was appointed interim CEO a over what many so I was more qualified executive within the utility Melissa day there was criticism that he really wasn't didn't have the skill set to lead the company\nWill he be chosen by the board is the permanent CEO is the big question\nYeah and and what are people I've talked to the community that they would like to see I mean for to make it look legitimate for Amazon gift job maybe he can keep her position and there's some place\nBut maybe he shouldn't get the job and that will make it look like all of this has been butchered I'm an old alone I mean do you can move forward because this is going to be one of those things that go forward people aren't going to forget\nAbout all of the information that came out almost this time last year regarding a potential fail and all of that and that is going to be with the mayor because Arizona to this guy you know fair or unfair it's going to live with them if there's if the guy just\nCame out and could this whole thing um be fodder for potential challenger to mayor Cory all and broke Leo with Jay it it\nCould it could but right now who who is it and and I mean there are a couple of names that easily come to the surface but in the in the the reality I don't I\nDon't think so I don't doubt it will be there'll be a challenge I just don't know how how's think south viable yeah\nThere there were commercials or wherever topics before you know frame of the day was being sold and the mayor was behind it so I Can't imagine they're whoever runs against the news is going to this is you go without trying to use it as a campaign issue\nNow now one thing is also happened since this board meaning right so Moody's announced they were going to do this down ... Fitch came out I think yes\nDay and said that well this lawsuit with plant mogul over the UJA trying to get out of this power purchase agreements\nA which is the reason why Moody's is saying they're downgrading them a fish came out and said it doesn't affect us it doesn't affect you know our ratings we believe that they're making their payments I'm Alan Howard and\nUm who's the board chair made a very um very pointed effort at the board meeting to go on record and lambaste Moody's and and just reiterate the Ga pays their debts and that they're they're having no sound financially\nOkay and finally it's our look at these strange bizarre and just plain ridiculous from around the state this week luckily there's never a shortage of material here it is for you right now only in for\nThat [noise] dom meat dish in just in time for Halloween only in Florida I can you take a college course dominates because her about it no longer Eric\nMa of Rollins College in Orlando has to turn students away from his course every semester it's come down these serial killers and Mad Men it's one of the most popular\nClasses on campus what makes laws course unique is that it's offered through his philosophy department that the other on college philosophy department saw sessions zombies have murderous in and he\nLooks at them through the prism of consciousness I heard to die for [laughter] or only in Florida\nThere twenty seven thousand proposed constitutional amendment on the November ballot you know actually there are\nIs when you go to vote in this upcoming mid term election you devote or will be confronted with one of the longest balance the state has seen in the last ...\nYears she got to do your homework got to do your homework that's right [noise] go to the league of women voters website or a number of other websites to research needs amendments and you can thank your state legislators and the constitution revision commission\nAll of the ballot amendments which somehow the legislature could not pass through the normal legislative [noise] and we got a week left [laughter] All right\nThank you John Bachmann of action news Charles Greg's have real talk and David cotton of the daily record guys thanks for being here and have a wonderful weekend you type you we'll be right back\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Coast Connect With Melissa Ross", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "20"}
