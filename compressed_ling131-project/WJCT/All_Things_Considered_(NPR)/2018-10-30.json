Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro and just the past week we've seen three high profile cases of domestic extremism too are deadly shootings one at the synagogue in Pittsburgh the other at a grocery store in Louisville, Kentucky\nThe third was the explosive sent through the mail to prominent Democrats all three of the suspects now in custody are men born here on the U.S NPR's Greg Myre he joins us now to talk about the common threads between these incidents Hi Greg hey are we hear so much about the international terrorism and efforts to stop people from other countries these incidents are all homegrown how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story deadly attacks by the far right white supremacist\nOutnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe ... the death toll passed Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target a small minorities in smaller numbers than him indiscriminate attacks so that many of the radical Muslims have carried out and when\nYou look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other a men born in the u._s. should we read something into that is this the new face of extremism\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks\nReally started picking up about a decade ago oh the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media the Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments and the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nAlways told worker co workers that he admired Hitler and thoughts of gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated I spoke to Bill Braniff the director of the stark consortium at the University of Maryland um they steady terrorism in in his research points to this far right obsession that white Americans are at risk\nWhat did the characteristics of an individual that allow them to go from non violent in support of one of these ideologies to violence and we find that the believing in this collective sense of victimhood isn't your necessary condition\nGreg we've seen so much in the way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism\nProbably not the same level or Christopher Wray the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he ... he said Islamic extremism he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that but he specifically said this was not is\nComic extreme if he was talking about here I'm In the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is the social media trail but there are so many American men expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell of who will act in who's just ranting\nWe're going to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these ... but first the FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it and the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interest the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut that way back then hasn't really focused on far right threats despite the growing numbers of attacks\nBut so if you're a national security correspondent Greg Myre Thanks Greg thanks sorry\nBefore Robert Bowers walked into the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh and allegedly gunned down eleven people he posted I'm going in on his social media account this was an account on gab a social network that prides itself on being censorship free\nGas has since gone dark but the company says it's working around the clock to get back on line to talk more about how gab\nHas created a space for white supremacists and other extremist views we turn now to Joan Donovan she said he's media manipulation at data and society of research Institute in New York City welcome thank you for having me\nYou're somebody who's been monitoring gap for a while now before it was taken down how many people in gab react to the synagogue shooting\nThere was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nSo more than a book shall we like to say\nTo afford its own space the collective asked for donations and loans they got what they needed and more after securing enough funds to buy an old bank building they asked for a few supporters to help them move the books to the new location\nWe were hoping to get sued to maybe a hundred people on the day we have a two hundred people who turned out which was like to hold\nReader by reader they formed a human chain and book by book transferred the books to the new location\nIt's um no she just distance it's about a hundred and fifty meets his you'd say within within show up this does still creeps me out a fair amount to people so to or within like by the ...\nPeople waiting at bus stops came to help and passers by all through joined this literary chain the whole process collectively took about an hour\nIt was really sort of surprising and positive and just really moving experience to see people chipping in\nBecause they wanted to help and they want to be ... something big

think of Sarah Bernstein is a professor at the University of Oklahoma College of law and by Pete she means intellectual property\nTinder has patent and trademark covering the way it works but bumble has counter suit and called those IP claims bogus you don't own the concept of swiping rights or swiping left you don't own the concept of matchmaking\nAnd there's a lot of money at stake Forbes values bumble it over a billion dollars in tenders worth even more so tender didn't invent matchmaking or swiping but can it on the idea of swipe based dating apps\nIt turns out that's a complicated question and it raises much bigger issues titans are supposed to cover specific inventions they aren't supposed to cover abstract ideas Daniel ... is a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier

patent\nIs just the abstract idea of matchmaking but online that's no longer allowed but did I mention that it's complicated\nWhat is abstract is itself up pretty abstract and challenging question\nYou can't patent software your idea just has to be an innovation so of course tinder says that swiping to match people was unique in innovative\nThis swipe fight is still working its way through the courts but in the meantime it's clear the Supreme Court decision tightened the rules for software patterns which is that a big impact way beyond the dating industry neither argues it's been a positive change promoting healthy competition\nBut others worry that good patents are being thrown out as well Michael Risch is a professor at Villanova University law school\nIf you apply the

on the rise in anti Semitic attacks an anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd to talk more about anti Semitism and white nationalism we reached out to a lotta Kaufman she works on racial justice issues in the Jewish community welcome thank you it's great to be here\nI Want to start with a very basic question but it's a question that's still confound me why are Jews such a focus for white nationalist\n[noise] you know for white nationalist theirs is deep deep commitment to maintaining political historical um an institutional supremacy in the United states I'm an around the world in terms of you know global white nationalism there's a perspective that a certain kind of lightness is superior\nA real intention to maintain that kind of superiority both on on the international level in terms of attitudes or behaviors and beliefs and how to transpire between people but also on ... on a national level who are politics um through the way that we talk about and documented history authored a way that we manager institutions and it's um an effort to maintain power\nAnd to keep people who are different um marginalized 'em and separated in in our communities\nYou mentioned in a certain kind of whiteness in much of the American Jewish community is of European descent and identify as being white but you're kind of thing that makes no difference to white nationalist why do you think that uh\nEighty to Ninety percent of Jewish Americans are are white or come from a white background to white nationalism\nYou know are Jewish community here in the United states already comes from immigrant backgrounds are to come from backgrounds that had a strong ethnic identity when we came to this country\nAnd all we were among the whole group of people from different countries who were other because of our our our national origin and just certain kinds of white in his were elevated and celebrating in this country as far as history goes back\nWe should mention that you are Jewish but you're also black white nationalist hatred of Jews different from racism against blacks Latinos and other minorities that they see as threats\nPeople of color are visibly different and because of that we've been an easy group to target and we've been an easy group to keep separate from those who have more skinned privilege because their skin presents later or wider and then in contrast we think about that\nIn terms of Jews and if we assume that most user white in this country then we have to find another way\nTo separate Jews out and so this particular brand of white nationalism in the United states as a particular kind of Christian white nationalism is designed to take away from this idea that we are stronger because of our diversity and to scare people into thinking we are stronger because of our individual identities\nSued you see something new about the anti Semitism we see in the U.S today I'm anti Semitism has persisted for centuries but there is something different\nAbout it now what's different about this time is that we have people in power who are using their institutional positions that have traditionally been is designed to bring us together as a country to separate us of the country through anti Semitic you think that's the new\nThink when we have our policy makers amplifying ideas as a real amplifying stereotypes as fact and using fear to\nMarginalize Jewish people in a way to elevate the fear mongers it is different and the other thing that's different is the empowerment of the anti Semite to express their anti Semitism and ways that are terrified\nSo what new strategies can we or the Jewish community in particular employ\nTo combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nThing that we need to remember is that white nationalism is designed to marginalize all of us and so the the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships so that when we need each other as neighbors and friends\nAnd when the white supremacist come knocking on doors or when they come marching down our streets that we know each one of us are going to come out of our houses and support the other that we will not question who needs who need just kind of advocacy but it becomes part of our culture as a as a as a as a as a nation and out of the people that is our most important strategy right now\nA lotta Kaufman is director of the Jews of color field building initiative thank you very much for joining us today Thanks so much worse than the patient with my

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro and just the past week we've seen three high profile cases of domestic extremism\nToo are deadly shootings one at the synagogue in Pittsburgh the other at a grocery store in Louisville, Kentucky\nThe third it was the explosives sent through the mail to prominent Democrats all three of the suspects now in custody are men born here on the U.S NPR's Greg Myre he joins us now to talk about the common threads between these incidents Hi Greg hey Ari we hear so much about the international terrorism and efforts to stop people from other countries these incidents are all homegrown how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story deadly attacks by the far right white supremacist\nOutnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe death toll passed Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target a small minorities in smaller numbers than in the indiscriminate attacks so that many of the radical Muslims have carried out and when\nYou look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other a men born in the u._s. should we read something into that as if the new face of extreme is\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks\nReally started picking up about a decade ago oh the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media the Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments in the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nAre always told worker coworkers that he admired Hitler and thoughts of gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated I spoke to Bill Braniff the director of the stark consortium at the University of Maryland um they said he terrorism in in his research points to this far right obsession that white Americans are at risk what are the characteristics\nOf an individual that allow them to go from non violence in support of one of these ideologies to violence and we find that the ...\nUsing in this courtroom sense of victimhood isn't your necessary condition\nGreg we've seen so much in the way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism\nProbably not the same level a Christopher Wray the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he ... he said Islamic extremism and he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a few thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that\nBut he specifically said this was not Islamic extremists he was talking about here I'm\nIn the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is the social media trail but there are so many American men expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell of who will act in who's just ranting\nWe're going to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these ramps up but first the FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it on the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interest the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut that way back and hasn't really focused on far right threats despite the growing numbers of attacks\nBecause if you're a national security correspondent Greg Myre Thanks Greg thanks sorry\nBefore Robert Bowers walked into the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh and allegedly gunned down
