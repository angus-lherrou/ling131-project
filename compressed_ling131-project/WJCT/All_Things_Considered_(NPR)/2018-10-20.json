before he did this by both the school district and law enforcement as being a severe risk to both himself and the school and they ignored those warning signs and my\nBiggest fear is that we pass legislation or in the heat of the moment and tell everyone that we've solve something when in fact we've actually left all of our children at the same amount of risk as the day before in fact maybe more risk\nBecause you're not paying attention to the issues that are really important here are you you we've got a mental illness challenge in this this country and I've I've tried to work on it or before the Parkland issue as a delegation southwest Florida we've\nSecured funding and worked on a ... dodge center with Lee county or you have people that get arrested that have a addiction issues they have depression issues they have mental illness issues they shouldn't go to the general population they need to get treatment\nThey need to be diverted to or the resources that are going to help them and we've helped fund that but there's so much more we need to do in that space and\nRepresent really let me just ask you about the the the legislation itself because if you are elected as the commissioner of agriculture you would certainly be involved\nIn enforcing some of that with your thought that the ban on a long gun purchases by Floridians under the age of Twenty one which is now the state law would you appalled that law elected as I was secretary commissioner even though you may have deem that unconstitutional\nWell again my job is Misha would be to evaluate whether or not you deserve to get a concealed weapons permit and whether you meet the qualifications or for that said permit or the other questions are actually uh the commissioners to regulate but again the bigger focus I think is is\nWhat'd you do this thing then is as commissioner of agriculture are claiming that that portion of the law is unconstitutional\nWhile I Believe those lawsuits have already been filed and and following suit and I'm certainly going to respect\nTheir outcome there there's certainly a no shortage of differences of opinion on any kind of the issues that deal with constitutionality I I think it's really just incumbent or on those of us who are asked to answer a question to say what we truly in engineering to leave and then you have to\nMove forward based on that but again the the real issue is is focusing on ah the at risk youth that we have\nIn our school systems are that are really a or a danger to themselves and to the student body and we're being ignored in this example and I'm worried are going to be ignored and not just Broward County but throughout the state because we're not focusing on the actual issue at hand\nAnd right now if you're just tuning in on the floor to round up we're speaking with state representative ... called well the Republican candidate for agriculture commissioner you can follow the conversation on line on Twitter at Florida round up\nNow represented Caldwell you've talked a lot about the plight of citrus farmers in the state we always think of Florida as having the three ... of the economy here a tourism\nGrows and agriculture the agriculture sector and had a hard time in some respects recently a lean production years because there's competition from Mexico hurricanes greening diseases of the citrus crop\nUp what's your proposal for a I guess shoring up the sector of the economy and making it more robots how would you approach that part of the job\nKnow the or the department of agriculture really has two big roles that he can play a not just in citrus but in all agriculture commodities and the\nFirst site is is advocating supporting the funding at University of Florida in the Institute of food and agricultural science you'll see called ISIS that's the research arm of the the university that constantly looking for ways to solve disease issues like citrus greening up but also to be researching a new crop varieties are they've got\nA current trial on hops for example and trying to take advantage of the growth and the craft beer industry\nAre also a help this last year a secure a trial an industrial hemp are both fame you Andrew F or exploring that different crop varieties so in alternative if someone doesn't believe they want to stay in whatever whether it's interest or anything else that doesn't seem like that's the direction they want to go\nOff in an alternative or the other goal is to continue to be engaged a greater and greater uh regard in trade ah we've got great uh\nA bilateral relationships with South American Central American countries European countries\nWere constantly looking for new ways to open up markets for our products again being a state that doesn't have just you know corn and soybeans and pigs but instead we have three hundred plus commodities you know tropical fruits and vegetables and as you pointed out the citrus industry we grow rice radishes\nA wintertime vegetables tomatoes or eggplants rabbit or just really an amazing\nYeah it's a rainbow and it's a lot more than people realize yeah\nDon't produce section\nHas totally exactly we're we're constantly looking for new trade opportunities and elevating uh those those chances internationally but then also\nA having a state this growing by a thousand people today are also looking within the state we really have two different sectors in the market in in Florida you got large commodity producers and that they're going to get bigger\nTo compete in the global scale but we've got these great opportunities with very vocally relevant or you know selling within a hundred mile radius of operations that are are really booming right now\nRepresentative just about a minute and a half left I got to ask about the do not call list uh it it is a ... under the saddle for a lot of Floridians\nI Would do a pledge to a boost enforcement of not call list if elected\nWithout question or if people need to be prosecuted I Would have to remind people encourage them to make sure they reported in fact I was talking to somebody the other day and it struck me a we ought to actually look to develop an app or where if you get a call most people get solicited on their phones their cell phones nowadays\nImmediately be able to Texas Department and report the phone number or because otherwise if you don't report it's very possible\nWhy isn't it being enforced if the laws on the books why isn't it being enforced\nWhat I think it is I think you just like every con artist or they're constantly looking for ways to outrun the law and or whether we're talking about do not call scams where they're talking about skimmers gas pumps or the\nOther major threat right now the hackers breaking into the backside of major retailers target Wal Mart et cetera and stealing our credit card info a as a law enforcement side you've got to constantly be up to speed can track them down wherever they're headed\nRepresentative we've got to leave it there but thank you so much for your time we appreciate your conversation here on the floor to round up it's a representative Matt called

real\nReading the book to become this kind of strange special thing that they started to feel like I was reading my own diary that's all coming up but first this news\nIn the last two years in Saudi Arabia\nSo what are some of the priorities that you think that the media and the public should be thinking about as the story continues to unfold\nOne of the key messages here is that the United states really asked the staff\nDoesn't mean breaking relations ending economic card ignoring our security true but I think it does mean that both the media and outlaws and governments in the United states and was really need to pick up on this incident\nAnd make it clear to every one in the area that this kind of operation is going to get government officials in park into very deep international ...\nDo you see any indication that this administration or leaders in Congress are inclined to send that message\nI think that one has to be very careful right now are so bad in some ways\nOn a part of some level that people have ignored or President Trump has said he has done taught as an unacceptable and I think it's aren't like Claire already that members of Congress and go and find gold this out as a key issue one where Armstrong's first ties to Saudi Arabia\nCould be seriously affected and it's clear\nSome kind of actual women to Armstrong through the poverty rate but I think the problem here is\nThat there is a reason why we're showing restraint this is the largest oil exporter in the world it affects the security stability growth of the global economy\nIs the key power in terms of dealing with the and the problem is not to sever relations it is to restrain in ways where it is clear on both at the expectations that aren't like our normal in the international community can be applied in Saudi Arabia's while\nThat's Anthony Cordesman with the center for Strategic and International Studies he's a former national security system to Senator John McCain he's written many many books about the middle east and he's consulted with both the state department and the defense department or Mr ... thank you so much for talking to us once again a pressure\nThousands of Central Americans mostly from Honduras are stuck on Guatemala's border with Mexico they are part of a so called caravan of folks who hope to get to the U.S border and eventually into the U.S reporter Emily Green has been traveling with them and she's now on the bridge that separates quarter mile or from Mexico and she's with us\nNow Emily thanks so much for talking to us thanks for having a little bit more about where you are and what's happening right now\nSo I'm On this bridge a set up right spot on Mexico and what I'm saying right now are babies and their diapers kids without shoes on tons of men and moms it feels like I'm In the midst of a humanitarian crisis\nCan you just tell us a bit more about what people are telling you who they are and why they've been willing to go through all this so most of them\nCame from Honduras and there are so ah folks from El Salvador and some from Guatemala but the vast majority from Hunter S what they told me largely is that this was a\nPlan they read or heard about the caravan and conditions and in Honduras are on the bad that they can't get past that there is no food that they're they're simply\nStarving and that they had to take a chance they also felt much safer and numbers to travel to Mexico as part of a big group of people instead of just a loan or paying a smuggler or coyote to take them\nTo understand that a number of people are actually turning back now\nThat's right so Guatemala has said buses to take those migrants who want to return to Honduras to take them back voluntarily and so I talked to a woman by the name of Rosalind Lopez as you name as she's twenty six years old she said like many of the other migrants that she\nStarted to join the caravan hasn't come due decision but but she regretted that decision along the way she has four children back in Honduras and she says she knew the trip would be hard but it's even worse than she imagined\nSilver ... they're not all the more she says to me she'll suffer back and under is at least she'll keep for life and she refers to the fact that yesterday the Mexican police deployed tear gas against migrants trying to enter Mexico and that people got hurt and so she says given these condition it's better that she returned to Honduras\nBut you said that there are still several thousand people there so that suggests that most of the people are going to try to stay in and move on to keep moving with the caravan\nThat's right up until this point I mean I'd say there's maybe two to three thousand people on the spread most of them are moving forward I talked to a twenty four year old Kevin cut them India he's traveling with his younger sister and a friend or they've been travelling for three days they camped out on the bridge last night with thousands of the other migrant\n'em and they want to reach Florida with their friends here's what he had to tell me\n...\nHe says the Europe becomes your friends so few become scared you use that to your favor and it pushes you forward and he says we're going to try and get across in Mexico anyway they pan and that includes by boat or trying to cross the spreads that I'm On right now\nYou know President Trump has reacted furiously to this he's been speaking about it a campaign rally demanding that Mexico closed the border by any means necessary he claimed to send us troops to the southern border\nI I was wondering if that message is getting through to the people that you've been talking to and what sense do you have from all the both of Margaret sending authorities there\nI Would say that virtually none of the migrants on this bridge really know what I'm saying they don't have cell phone service or they don't have money to charge your cell phone so it's basically word of mouth they know Trump's doesn't want them they absolutely\nKnow that but that's almost meaningless to them what they want to do is leave their lives they're they're very poor they're very violent life behind\nAnd on tourists are so they're going to push forward but I\nHave this sense today on the bridge that this is not going to end the well I don't have the sense that all of a sudden Mexico is going to let these three thousand people and um and so it makes me wonder what's gonna happen to them that this is this is going to turn for them to a humanitarian crisis where these people are going to go I don't think it's going to end well\nEmily Green is a reporter based in Mexico and she's with us now from the bridge that separate from Mexico from Guatemala with thousands of would be migrants
