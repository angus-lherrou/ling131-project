academics and prison staff\nWe found that across the country women are disproportionately discipline for low level offenses in Indiana women had more than double the rate of tickets than men and three times as many tickets for refusing to obey an order\nIn Vermont female inmates are three times as likely to get a ticket for making a derogatory comment and in California women or two and a half times as likely to be ticketed for disrespecting an officer\nAlyssa Benedict has a national expert in a small but growing movement to address this disparity she says this system of punishing women for mostly non violent behavior is causing more problems than at solving\nAll people are suffering right now under hidden just what were funny however that women are stepping very unique impact\nBenedict says that because women in prison often have a history of trauma\nAccording to the Illinois audit Ninety seven percent of female inmates have been the victims of sexual or physical abuse they show signs of post traumatic stress disorder more than any other study demographic including combat vets that's according to a twenty ten study by the Illinois criminal justice information authority\nAnd the ways that women are controlled and punished in prison with things like isolation strip searches or loss of phone privileges Benedict says these responses exacerbate that past trauma\nWe're leaning on these very outdated tool it's an instrument of discipline that have no rounding psychological research and are actually in that article at a rate of Charlotte recovery\nAnd the isolation doesn't

congratulations ... are in order\nWell right now I'm seeing\nLines lines for gas lines for food and water at the emergency relief stations that have been set up in and around Panama City and out in the countryside\nUm but that's an improvement because a couple of days ago there wasn't a whole lot of aid getting out into Panama City or anywhere else and and when I'm Still seeing is a lot of destruction\nUm a lot of trees down and so many electrical poles electrical wires in the streets even high tension wires I've seen bend over and and down on the ground it's really it's unbelievable stuff out there and um you know there's lots of crews out clearing the trees electrical crews are trying to get a handle\nOn all these downed wires and and try to start rebuilding the electrical infrastructure but\nIt's just a giant mess and and I think it's going to be for a while\nAnd communication still resting places because phone services down the Internet down how has that affected rescue efforts\nRight cells cell phone service has been really almost nonexistent I'm throughout much of the weekend and it's still really spotty um and and I think is hampering rescue efforts are in a couple of ways I mean one is that at first it was difficult for emergency responders even to communicate\nWith each other and the hours and days right after the storm and it's still really difficult for people to contact their families right because there was no Internet and there's and there's limited cell phone service and so you can't just call people outside of of the bubble in Panama City and say\nYou know I'm All right I'm here and when emergency officials are trying to figure out\nYou know who's missing and and who they should be trying to find you know\nThat makes it very difficult and I I think it's really got to be slowing down this this whole process\nBut there are some areas that have power back right\n[noise] um yeah but I I I think there are there is some hope that there's going to be power restored across a lot of the county um by the end of the week and the the utility company here Gulf Power has a sort of put out on a map showing you know which areas of the county they hope to have um\nYou know pretty much back on line and you know it is a good part of the county that they expect to have on line by the end of the week\nBut they're really not saying anything yet about the hardest hit areas in Manama city and Lynn haven and some of the other suburbs right around the city I'm likely to be weeks while I think maybe months until there's power in some of those places\nHundreds of thousands of people if they're\nIn the city of Panama City is about thirty seven thousand before the storm and then there's some of these suburbs of you know five or ten thousand on top of it I mean yeah I think hundreds of thousands in the region um you know I I I think the latest numbers or something like Seventy or eighty thousand as of last night's still didn't have power\nBut um you know those numbers will come down but I you know I think in the hardest hit areas\nYou know that that's going to be very hard to get everybody back on line because of the infrastructure is just destroyed they're going to have to rebuild you know almost everything\nSpeaking of rebuilding you've talked to a a bunch of people over the last couple of days what are they saying to you about rebuilding\nUm people are\nSaying that they plan to stay in their houses to me you know they they want to rebuild their looking ahead at how they can do that but\nYou know the reality is that there's a huge amount of destruction it's going to be a long time before you know there can be enough workers to even start looking at any of this stuff and these are not wealthy communities by and large I mean these are people a lot of them living paycheck to paycheck and\nYou know it's hard to see where they're going to get the money for a new roof or a or even a whole new house\nThat's NPR's Joel Rose talking to us from Florida where he's reporting on the aftermath of hurricane Michael things Joe You're welcome [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nTo TV documentaries on the criminal justice system debuted this week on Monday HBO is going to air the sentence that is a film about a woman can in Fifteen Years in prison for crimes committed by former boyfriend\nThen friday Netflix Davies the second season as it hit true crime program making a murder here\nTo talk with us about these project is NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans Hey Eric huh All right let's talk about the sentence first this was filmed over a ten year period by Rudy van ... says he's the brother of the woman sentenced whose name is Cindy shank\nHow does this show expose issues in the criminal justice system\nWell first I got to say I've been reviewing TV for a long time I was crying by the end of this I I mean it the sentences the surprisingly emotional story about a couple of things\nMandatory minimum sentencing and prosecuting people for crimes committed by their romantic partners so Valdez is sister Cindy was in this relationship with this guy who was involved in drug dealing and he got killed\nAnd it's six years later after she's married she's had three kids federal authorities arrest prosecute and convict or on conspiracy charges so and the mandatory minimum sentence for that was Fifteen Years now we've got a clip of Cindy describing what it was like to face that sentence let's check it out\nMarshall said take on my wedding ring\nThat's where I felt like that when I got when I was going\nTo take my daughter\nAt forever\nSo her brother Rudy found as a documented the struggle for the family to cope and so we see her kids grow up over nearly a decade we see Cindy moved to a prison far away from her family and then there's this emotional twisted and that just drives home how much she's lost over all this time\nIn that clip we just heard she says she's guilty\nShe's guilty of knowing about the crimes that um her boyfriend was committing and not calling the cops are you know doing something to try and stop it having knowledge of a crime or can mean that you're part of the conspiracy to commit a crime\nAnd this Friday the second season of making a murderer is debuting the first season was such a hit tell us about the second season\nSo the first season a exposed a nation to the story is Steven Avery who's this guy in Wisconsin He was exonerated in two thousand and three by DNA evidence after serving almost Twenty years for sexual assault and attempted murder then he gets arrested and convicted of committing a different one\nThere are a few years later along with his nephew who's named uh Brendan Bessie so the first season raises some doubts about the evidence that they collected against Avery and expose allegations that the nephews confession was unfairly coerced this season is about every ... appeal of his conviction that efforts by bringing Daschle to have his confession thrown out\nIt sounds very like getting into the nitty gritty as a legal process\nWell I think that's one reason why the show might be less impactful because it's a more mundane story about how tough it is to appeal these kinds of convictions\nDid you find a link between the two documentaries\nYeah I I think they both trying to humanize people who've been convicted of crimes and show the really brutal impact of these really long prison sentences I mean we are incarcerating a tremendous amount of people in this country for long stretches of time sometimes for non violent crimes\nAnd it's valuable to have a high profile TV project which is kind of reminds us of the consequences\nNPR TV critic Eric Deggans thank you so
