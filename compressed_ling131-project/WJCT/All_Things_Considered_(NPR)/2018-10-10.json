drenched some places still reeling from Hurricane Florence\nPlaces such as New Bern North Carolina we interviewed Dana outlaw he's the mayor of New Bern on September fourteenth so not even a month ago as floodwaters from Florence swamped city\nWe have had twelve hundred nine one one request on the last twelve hours that's very unusual\nAnd we have called mayor outlaw back to ask about how the cleanup effort is gone and how they're bracing for this next hurricane mirror outlaw ... a good to have you with us\nThank you um we have a lot of the breed down we picked up about thirty five percent what\nWe're trying to do right now is just stabilize the degree that we have not take the soda and the event of a twenty to forty miles per hour when that this debris material will stay put not scatter\nWell let me let me back you up because when we talk to you not quite four weeks ago a with Florence you hum had\nAsked people to evacuate you actually were telling us about firefighters out on fire trucks telling people to leave get some more safe how about this time are you looking to evacuate or telling people to stay safe stay put\nWorld than by we have an emergency operations center that we have not activated we have forty one truck\nPicking up debris as quickly as we can we have nine cities and towns across the state that are\nHelping us for that effort we just uh you know we're all prayer for our friends down in Florida Georgia South Carolina what this thing will not be anything like the fact that we had for SARS was a storm surge and this appears to be more of a of a ... when\nThere is anything on the weekend by the time it hits it hits you we hope when\nYou say you've got people out picking up debris you're talking about\nBrief still left from Hurricane Florence are you talking about stuff that's just come down newly since then with wind\nOil what's kind of like in phases we uh the initial debris from the shock of of what happened and and now folks are are getting in getting as life without murder to their home they're finding out that their heat pumps and HVAC systems have been compromised the work\nAnd so uh you know sheet rock and and all the components of the home uh you know we just uh after careful inspection by our respective department and many as ... as we found that there's a lot more detailed or what has to be done than than what we initially so\nStill got a lot of buildings there\nOthers businesses et cetera with with ... fervor after Hurricane Florence is that right\nWhat we still have seven hundred homes of twenty two thousand\nThat we cannot re power book called the electric components were were compromised during the storm of that we're working as hard as we can with the owners to get licensed contractors electrical contractors to come in and correct there's problems that we can re power the home\nAnd then I was reading some schools are had reopened the rest of the craven county schools that\nHad been shot since Hurricane Florence we're set to reopen this week did they\nAh some of them did some of them still are not\nAre not opening um we we actually had five different shelters with twelve hundred\nCitizens and now that sounds about a hundred at our website ... center a we have two large rec centers and they were one of them are had two feet of water in it so we're we're just everywhere you look from power being down all out twenty two thousand customers that power\nDown uh we're we're continuing to to put our city back together\nThis must just feel like adding insult to injury to

down um\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk gain since mid summer\nBut the tech sector has been the hardest hit and handed and as I said it's one of the foundations of the market and in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the S. and P. five hundred ... which also has a lot of tech lost three and a third percent so it was a tough day for everyone

we're doing now is only a few days like\nSuddenly Richard Harris Perry Hi Randy Randy ... started out in Los Angeles where he lived eaten tuna sandwich that he suspects had gone bad the day before he hopped a plane to visit his son in Nashville\nAnd we got on the plane and I just didn't feel right\nNow I asked and like you know\nWhat's going on these K. and he's saying if I send my son\nBothering me his wife Karen couldn't convince ready to go to a doctor until the symptoms got out of control\nHe was rushed to the emergency room closest to his son's house\nHour from Nashville and they just started putting intended of lines and going to work and doing different things and kind of ... what was happening at that point because\nYou mentioned the shock when you go in there and they're like oh every Oregon is shutting down and have completely sepsis sepsis\nAs a leading cause of death and hospitals it's the bodies overwhelming reaction to an infection ... case was so bad the forty nine year old men ended up on a respirator and dialysis drugs sunk him into a state of quiet Elyria\nBecause he was supposed to be lightly sedated and he was heavily sedated and that was not a good thing\nKaren says when the hospital told her to start calling next of kin and it was time to get them transferred stat to hospital better equipped to treat him within twenty four hours of arriving at Vanderbilt Randy's condition had turned around completely he was off dialysis the ventilator and off the drugs that put him into a delirious have\nApparently I'm pretty much of a miracle\nTo me he said that you were on one out of a\nRecovery still lies ahead\nI'm starting to get our faculty as about me and my brains starting to work really get again but\nJust the fact that I can you know carry a conversation right now is pretty amazing in itself and you've actually been up and walking around a little bit down labs around the size of a aids for anyway I mean I'm not going to do I mean that drink too much but yeah I Walk quite a bit\nDr early returns to the room and explains to the ... family what he'd done to help bring about this dramatic change it wasn't just good medical attention it was a philosophy\nYou know when you get on an airplane you get safely to the next location because airline industry has a checklist\nWhen he started in the ICU he realized every doctor did things differently and they figured they can't all be doing the right thing so gradually he started building a checklist of the best way to handle basic tasks first they figured out when it's safe to take someone off the ventilator he explains then\nWe started standardizing how to remove people off of ... then we came up with a way to measure of your brain was deliberation not what'd you got that measurement and we were doing this to you when you were there we were measuring whether you were delirious and you were at the beginning\nElite came up with a list of six steps to take in order to reduce delivery him in return patients to health as quickly as possible\nTo put all of this into a bundle which we now call the a B C D E F bundle\nBundle includes close management of drugs like sedatives which can cause the leery of\nPatients are tested daily to see if they can wake up and if they're ready to get off the ventilator F is for family engagement us as these all reduced the amount of time patients spend delirious and that in turn markedly reduces the risk of long term brain damage\nGetting out of bed early that eat part is cut in half so these things are all intersecting\nAs he sits on a ... bed usually explains that it's a big change from what many are you still do which is to knock out a patient and treat their dysfunctional body rather than focusing on them holistically\nTo me the lynchpin of this whole thing is to respect the humanness of each patient thank you again a little bit [noise] they hear him\nThe bundle when done correctly reduces the risk of ICU triggered dementia by twenty five to thirty percent easily says that makes a big difference to a lot of patients it's gradually been adopted it icy use in recent years but he says it's still not the standard everywhere\nAbout half from our last survey have been doing some elements of the bundle\nIt altogether a to F is a challenge factor\nVolcker at the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida discovered that when he took part in nationwide study to expand the use of the bundle in all sorts of hospital\nIt was not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects patients\nRequire more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into\nWe're talking about a a cultural change so we have to buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by and then you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and they only do rounds three days a week gradually the ideas too cold he says though they're still resistance to using the eighth through F checklist to make sure every element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F\nIs the exception it was even a challenge to make it routine at Vanderbilt\nLike a ... and I can't be\nJoanna starlings or clinical pharmacist at the ICU says when she arrived at Vanderbilt it was clear what needed to get done but nobody was responsible for seeing it through\nThey need to many cat were nice to be here and racing or gay in San ... helped me had champion this project really empower the American dream than than having everyday\nWest elites crusade now is to make what this hospital does standard around the world for one thing he argues it can actually save money by reducing the amount of time people spend an expensive ICU words\nBut the most important thing of course is not the money is the human being and so if they're getting better care surviving more often with a more intact brain and not bouncing back to the ice you always see some financial benefit\nTo me that's a win

swept through South Florida in Nineteen Ninety two the damage was a lot greater than anybody expected some insurance companies went bankrupt\nAnd their reinsurance market which is the way insurance companies usually protect themselves from big losses actually dried up for a while so this new way of controlling for risk was developed than it was called the catastrophe bond essentially an insurance company sells a bond and the investor gets paid interest for\nIt OK so tell me how that works like what would happen if there is a catastrophe like a hurricane or some out of control wildfire or an earthquake\nWell if there is a serious natural disaster than the buyer of the bond has to foot the bill for some part of the damage so if you buy one of these bonds\nYou're sort of gambling that there won't be a bad hurricane season this year because\nYou know is there is you could take a loss for example right now about Fifteen billion dollars worth of catastrophe bonds have some exposure in Florida where hurricane Michael has had what kinds of investors are buying cap on well mostly big institutional investors hedge funds a mutual funds may be your own pension fund\nThey like to include them because they're a good way to diversify risk and what I mean is\nIf the economy slows you typically see a lot of different assets like stocks and real estate in salon\nLose value at the same time but the value of catastrophe bonds isn't tied to the economy it's tied to you know Mother Nature so when everything else is losing ground you can still make it was oh I see uh-huh their way of hedging risk which investors like\nIt's really popular these these catastrophe bonds or cat bonds pretty popular there's about thirty billion dollars invested in them right now overall and the reason has to do with their ... they typically earn an investor at least five percent and sometimes a lot more than that and that's because they're potentially so much riskier than other kinds of bonds\nSo anyone investing in them is going to want to be paid more\nThere are some pretty major storms just in recent memory last summer there were three in a row we at Harvey which flooded Houston for days then we had Irma and Maria then just last month Hurricane Florence land into the Carolinas I mean one after another have investors lost a ton of money on their cat bonds because of these storms\nYeah last year was was particularly challenging for for the bonds and there was a lot of speculation that would kill off the market there was this fear you know investors would see these big losses and nobody would ever want to buy a catastrophe bombed again but the market has has come back pretty well\nSo as we're seeing more catastrophic storms are our tap on just going to become a riskier investment\nYeah and that's always going to be a potential problem no more big storms you have sort of less attractive the sponsor yeah name but there is another issue I think that is even more of an immediate problem over the past decade interest rates on things like treasury bonds have been very low so investors have turned to these catastrophe bonds because\nYou know they could are much higher interest rates on them well now interest rates in general are rising so relatively speaking catastrophe bonds aren't as attractive as an investment as they were in that's that's bound to

S. and from Americans for the arts\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly ... Chang President Trump is attacking Democrats over a plan to expand Medicare to cover all Americans\nIn an op ed published today in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he made a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa\nA majority of Democrats have already signed up for his socialist healthcare plan that would glitter right Medicare\nFor twenty million seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's planes and one of those facts ... is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us so we are just weeks away from them in terms now Democrats are talking a lot about health care to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now\nThey are ill so you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities it also taps into our pocketbooks and a big way so it has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters especially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place\nIn the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think it's their tour and they are campaigning against GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare fully half the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue above any other that is going to define the results in the November sixth election and\nIs health care and President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo why does come saying about that program in particular this this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nFirst thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tag\nThirty two point six trillion dollars over a decade now that sounds like a lot of money and it is but what the president leaves out some important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than we already have the costly as health care system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job the federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill\nBut we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing province\nAnd it's with a single payer system and how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nHe argues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing that doctors and hospitals would be put out of business that seniors would lose control of their health care\nBut he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seems to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost health security for younger Americans has to come at the expense of their higher seniors\nOkay that realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain veto and like Obamacare and GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and break when you actually have to debate the the details of the plant but\nIf we're going to have that debate Elsa is probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't really contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing condition is that true he\nHas made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare and they've proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees\nThe insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker Americans\nThat NPR fact checkers Scott Horsley think he's got You're welcome [noise]\nParts of the Carolinas are still trying to assess the damage from last month's Hurricane Florence and now here
