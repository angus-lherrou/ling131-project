{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Absolutely and I would think that has been the work of the Policy Center since we opened as well as the justice for girls movement it's recognizing the harmful impact of patriarchy and what we see how it not only impacts girls but how toxic it is to boys as well\nHere's an email about that from Chad I applied what they're doing actually to read I applaud what they're doing to address sexual assault trauma after the fact but what can we do as a society to prevent a salt in the first place\nAnd that you know that involves teaching our kids how to behave I'm particularly young boys changing the culture that's where the me too movement is all about\nAbsolutely and I and I want to clarify that I'm not a doctor so [laughter]\nThank you for that I'm promoted you loaded either and I'm not a doctor\nAnd an absolutely I think it starts in in Switzerland has this model where you know the conversation start in school in kindergarten around respect and what does respect me with each other in conversations around\nAnd you know how do you talk to each other males and females and what does consent look like and yet you know here we are afraid to have those conversations were afraid to have those conversations in middle school around consent\nUm and until we start having those conversations I'm ... and ... you know I worked on college campuses for many years and I was part of the orientation\nUm and I would always ask how many of the parents have had conversations with their daughters about how they need to stay safe on the college campus and every parent that had a daughter would put their hand out\nAnd I would then ask and this would be a conversation focused on sex and violence and violence against women how many of the parents here with boys talk to you your son's a round respecting women on college campuses\nAnd nobody would put their hand out mhm and until we start having the conversations with our son's around what does the respect look like it's not in a chef Dr Walker\nYeah to a doctor here we're too actually [laughter]\nI get I think the conversation with our senses they're very important\nAh and when we talk about um\nWhat the consent to look like one of the ways that the patriarchy is very harmful to men is that it tells them that because if they are real men and and and I'm making a very broad statement here but let me I'm just indulge me for one second with that\nI think one of the messages that we get from popular culture that get somehow transmitted ah from um through um just friendship circles however\nA real man doesn't really have to get consent if your a real man even what looks\nUm ah what looks like if you if you look as if you're being tool respectful then you may not be a exercising you're entitled but says a guy so I think that's really important the other thing that I think is important is to help young girls understand what consent means as well consenting to what end for what purpose\nI think a lot of the research sometimes shows us that everyone wants to be long everyone wants to feel that feel as if he or she matters and if sexual um [noise]\nIt sexual expressive and this is the only way to make that happen and sometimes I think we see people getting in for a really really dangerous and difficult\nSituations just in order to feel valued\nSo our I sort of go back to um what my colleague was saying here about creating healing centered communities and seeing the whole person seeing what kinds of incidents what kinds of teaching and messages\nLead people to such fought places where they do violence and are victims of violence\nDr ... wouldn't have to think [noise] one of the things that we're very excited about at the summit is that we have a survivor land panel on the second day that will be doing a keynote that really is from the perspective of survivors and these are young women who have been victimized by sex trafficking\nSo I think also hearing their voices and their experience will provide insight to our community and the participants\nSorry with all of that said people need to register now for the summit tell us about that how people can be part of it so\nRegistration is on our website they can go to see the girl dot org and sign up there\nAnd so we're really excited we still have a couple of spots open and um we would love to have you there we would love to um we have I think the fun part than everybody really really enjoys and Luanda favorite part is the ice cream bar\nAnd nice touch law into my favorite [laughter]\nAnd so if nothing else come for the ice cream and but we have incredible speakers we have a lab who is coming from California who will be talking about on the trans community and I'm trans and\nYet you're advocating for girls and young people who identify as girls as girls as well as the\nTrans community and how we can have micro aggressions and not even recognize it in our community and how that impacts the work and so I think that um our speakers are going to be brought in to be a very very inviting to a broad range of people\nSo we looked like to have one more call it's Brian in Jacksonville Hi Brian Brian you're on the right\nTo morning oh great harmless or I Am ... where they\nAre just order food at ... you know it's really are very sad

J. C. T.\n[noise] you're listening to eighty nine nine devil Eugene Levy at them Jacksonville visiting W. J. C. T. dot org\nFor information on our program are scheduled pan news from the version of\nBrett Kavanaugh is heading to the U.S Supreme Court and while the wounds from the process are still fresh\nIt's like we don't charge against each other brother or just for ...\nFor Saturday October ... this is all things considered from NPR News\nI'm Michelle Martin we'll get reaction from across the country and then we'll go to Chicago where a trial on a high profile police shootings as with historic verdict wager and\nBy the fact that they are guilty of murder\nPlus Amazon is about to raise an hourly wage for hundreds of thousands of workers but some worry it's not a great deal after all\nWe're worried about not getting our pay out and making less will try to do the math but first this news\nThat is NPR's Scott Detrow Scott thank you so much I think you\nWe are going to spend a bit of time to speak and trying to understand the fallout from this intense and emotional battle around Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination confirmation\nLater we're going to hear from one of Christine Blasey Ford's attorney said about what this episode has meant to her professor Ford of course being a woman who testified that judge Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago but we're also going to try to examine some of the divisions\nThat this whole process has laid bare including in the legal community and a remarkable development retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said publicly that cabinet is not fit for the high court\nEarlier this week more than twenty four hundred law professors or to send it in a letter not to confirm judge Kavanaugh needless to say other support and defend him UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh is one of them\nHe refused to sign the letter he mentioned that he clerked with judge Kavanaugh previously and socialized occasionally with him and he is with us now by a sky professor Volokh thank you so much for joining us very much for a pleasure thanks for having first of all I just wanted to ask\nHow you reacted when you saw the letter I understand that a law professor were circulating this letter\nI just wondered what your reaction was\nWell I sort of imagine how would I have acted if I were publicly accused on national international television of extraordinarily serious crimes and if I was innocent and the letter was was being done the assumption that a judge Kevin O's reaction was bad whether or not he was in\nI Can't imagine that I Would completely keep my cool\nUh I don't think most people would maybe if you could uh but I think a lot of people would be extraordinarily angry or that would feel kind of publicly humiliated\nAnd up even somebody with a reputation for ... and judicious in us as judge Kavanaugh has developed a A N his uh many years now in the DC circuit and could easily slip I think that's just human nature\nAnd one of the reasons that we college he was that you wrote a blog post that caught our attention and you mentioned that you clerked or at the same time as judge Kavanaugh and that you socialize occasionally with him do you think that you're the fact that you know him play some role and how you respond to this\nYou know I expect it probably does in some measure uh we're not terribly close we just I don't think we've seen each other for for for quite a while and we didn't see each other that often or even back then socially uh but uh my influenced by that sure I'm a human being like he's when being like all of us are\nAnd and as you know other human beings are many women are reacting very differently\nTo this they are bringing forward experiences that they have had where they have been assaulted I'm\nPhysically in some cases threatened with assault and their reactions to it are also very important then when the reason to be conscious that we're interested in as I said earlier kind of the fallout from this and the kinds of decisions that have been laid bare in this do you think\nThat people's personal reactions are guiding that response to this or do you think it's something else even among your colleagues\nI'm quite sure that personal reactions are guiding lots of people on this just because that is human nature I Can't speak any particular person uh but uh uh it it's not surprising that this would be so and I don't think it should be condemned but again if you're asking\nSomebody to maintain complete composure [noise]\nUm [noise] I think you're expecting something that is too much to expect of of normal people occasionally again you could have someone who does keep his cool under such extraordinary circumstances but I think that's the exception rather than the rule and I think if you're asking about judicial temperament a much better guide for judicial temperament is\nHow a judge Kavanaugh behaved in about ten years more than ten years on the DC circuit bench and everybody seems to say that his temper but it's but excellent\nThere I'll catch the except professor you know the defendants are accused of terrible things all the time that they may or may not have done and they are not allowed to behave in this way I mean a criminal defendant who presented himself in court or herself\nWho was accused of something terrible that he or she did not do would not be allowed to scream at people would not be allowed to be patronize them condescending toward the judge or toward other parties\nOr if I were a member of a jury and somebody was on the stand accused of effects could be anything else\nI and I saw him are reacting in anger when questioned by the prosecutor and interrupting say the prosecutor I I'd like to think I wouldn't hold that against him of course I'd look at the end I'd want to know if he's guilty\nUh but uh uh I Would say if he behaves angrily that anger is not inconsistent with innocence and it's not a fine\nBad character is a sign of someone who is reacting to very very serious accusation\nLet me go back to the question of the legal community um do you agree\nThat this is a an episode on and what else to call it I don't mean to minimize it by calling at that moment that has risen\nYour a profession one of the things she noted in your blog post is that a lot of people disagree with you people who've respect they disagree you disagree with other people whom you respect and that you've had a lively dialogue about it\nHas this been a notable moment for your profession and why do you think that is well\nA yes of course it's notable this is something that's very high profile\nAbout a very unfortunate matter a people sharply disagree on this of course the legal academy is overwhelmingly liberal\nAnd uh and as you pointed out a war one is coming from other callers ones perception and are just as conservatives are predisposed to respond to one way to such things that are broken other way so it's an surprising that there would be a lot of\nUh he's coming from kind of a hard one political reactions\nBut also or just in even people who are not particularly partisan I feel very strongly about this because it's in the news or a and because it is about somebody who can bird but even that math can for under will be a very important to a bigger in legal life for decades to come\nThat is Eugene Volokh he is the Gary tea switch professor of law at the UCLA school of law and he's the co founder of the vault conspiracy blog which is hosted ... reason professor Volokh thanks so much for talking to us\nAnd thank you so much for having\nYou're listening to all things considered

now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd she would likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman\nBut they will fail NPR's Frank Langfitt spent a decade reporting in China and he's here with us now in our studios in Washington DC to tell us more about the administration's case and why the speech was so remarkable Frank thanks so much for being here hey Michele great to be here but what is the significance of vice president Pence's speech and why now\nIt's so striking the tone if you went back if you look back over Thirty years four years of diplomacy Americans were actually quite careful not to be directly confrontational this is very very confrontational very aggressive almost has a feel to me\nOf a Reagan evil empire speech what it's signaling is he sees China is the greatest threat to the United states\nAnd in terms of the line now later in the speech he talked about the vice President Pence talked about trying to try to influence the mid term elections though he didn't provide any solid evidence and that could be a pretext to blaming a bad results for Republicans on China but there was a much bigger picture here that we should be talking about\nBut I Wanna hold that thought from it but I wanted to ask you have you seen a shift in how the Trump Administration has been dealing with China\nWhat I see with the Trump Administration\nIs it coincides with the sea change in attitude among scholars in the United states American businesses in the old days you went back to the nineties do thousands American business extremely supportive of the Communist Party they're making a lot of money there they now feel that the playing field is not level at all\nThey do feel sometimes held up to give up intellectual property so there's been a big shift here in attitude towards China and I really think actually Beijing is just catching up to it\nSo you're saying that the the change is not just that this administration's attitude that goes beyond that in fact there was a clip from vice president Pence's speech where he spoke to that let's play at\nThe Chinese Communist party is rewarding or for worse in American businesses movie studios universities think tanks scholars journalist and local state and federal officials\nIs that true ... example\nAbsolutely a and some of the self censorship I'll give you an example with in movies\nThere are a lot of movies that you might have made in the nineties early two thousand that might have been critical of China\nYou couldn't get the financing for them now because the Chinese audience has grown so much for movie it's so important to the bottom line of a global\nFilm a great example would be a remake of a movie called red dawn in which\nThe Chinese soldiers were to invade America in post production they had to change the Chinese soldiers in North Korean soldiers 'cause there's no way the Chinese ever would have ever\nLet that movie into China what about academics scholars absolutely it is and journalists to it is it's much harder now are getting visas can be more difficult they use them as a way to punish scholars you write about subjects\nThat they don't like about like ... far western\nArea in China as well as Tibet and Taiwan and so there are certainly a feeling that some scholars do sell censor in order to get visas others are very brave and and are willing to not be able to get visas to go in\nSo one more question for us as you know it was very focused on Russian influence in elections and a Russian efforts to interfere with us all elections when it comes to undermining confidence in democracy particularly let's say in the United states which country is the bigger concern Russia or China\nOr I think Russia has been very overt about it I think China what's concerning about China is that it's much more of a challenge it also would like to undermine the message of the United states which is freedom and democracy\nThe difference being that Russia does not have a business plan it's a relatively small compared to China in terms of economy China's an enormous economy getting very close to surpassing ours in the future\nAnd they're also a much more sophisticated and will run country and so I think it's a much much greater challenge but these days because of what happened in a few thousand than sixteen election this is what we focus on which is Russia\nThat NPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt visiting with us here in Washington DC Frank thank you so much happy to do it
