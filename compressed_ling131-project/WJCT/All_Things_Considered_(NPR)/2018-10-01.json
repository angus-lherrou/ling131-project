investigation that just gives us more covered for example we actually need to find out where we can find out\nSenator Jeff flake says that the FBI finds evidence Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath his nomination is over for Monday October first it's all things considered\n... and I'm Ari Shapiro the White House now says the FBI should interview anyone wants and the Kavanaugh investigations so how much can the bureau accomplishing one week\nLast year after the Las Vegas shooting one survivor is trying to help others deal with their trauma\nI ... in a panic thinking about how many people would invisible\nWounds later growing problems that General Electric\nIt became a big bureaucracy and it moved slowly in a world that kept moving more quickly and we'll remember the French singer Charles asthma born first these headlines\nAnd then this accusation came in so the important thing for me to be able to here was to be able to hear Dr Ford to be able to hear Brett Kavanaugh able to get to entirely different perspectives on it and it is a challenge to be able to piece things together obviously both an exceptional incredible witnesses both of them come with very very different stories\nBut it doesn't come down to a he said she said it comes down to he said she said they said and that's the challenge for me or the individuals that Dr Ford had said there were also there and they can also testified of this all of them instead came out and said we don't remember anything like that so well I don't have any reason to doubt to Dr Ford if something happened to her\nI Can't piece together that it was actually Brett Kavanaugh the one that was actually there\nWhat would the FBI have to find\nTo change your mind about Kavanaugh's fitness to serve on the Supreme Court\nOr the FBI was going to go back and do interviews and this is the hard part about this the FBI processes interviewing all the same people that the committee stuff is already interviewed or to be able to come through so they're gonna have to find some something different than what we've already seen which I think is very unlikely because the FBI is not doing a full on criminal investigation going through DNA and going through sides well\nThen if you think it's unlikely that the investigation will turn up anything worthwhile but the point of the investigation is this just a gesture and not a hollow gesture\nSo the pony investigations you will be two things one is somewhat democratic colleagues who told me their goal at the end of the day is to slow down the nomination all the way through the election day they're making an election issue or to be able to hopefully slow it down long enough that each week they would say we need one more week one more wait one more week so fully win the election\nI think that you wouldn't want to do the investigation because it is slowing things down\nNo I don't mind and investigation as long as the investigation is it fair that it's timely that it's not just designed to be able to drag on a week and at the end of it say well now we need another week and now in another way to the Anita Hill investigation or where the FBI that time was three days\nIf the investigation is indeed confined to one week uh your colleague in Tyler Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona has said that if the FBI investigation finds that Kavanaugh lied under oath during his hearings than his nomination dead do you agree with flight\nWould absolutely agree and then then the issues to fall is not only sexual assault is an issue but it's lying to Congress in lying under oath or clearly that would be disqualified\nEven if it's found that Kavanaugh lied about say his drinking habits do you think that would be to qualify as\nWell so that has been a whole new issue that I've been fascinated with that people have said OK if we can now now that we have him on a record for new things to try to find new things that maybe we we can say not necessarily lying about but we have different interpretations\nAre one people at one person says yes objectively I think you drink too much and he says objectively\nNo I don't think I was drinking too much then that's enough for lying enough to exclude them that's no longer a dialogue about sexual assault that's trying to find some way to trip up a nominee to be able to catch them on something based on some kind of history from thirty six years ago that there is no longer really drawn to be able to get to a judge that's trying to destroy someone personally\nI I Am offended by that I think most people should be\nQuite frankly many of my democratic colleagues\nHave said to me quietly I really hope that they don't reopen my time when I was in high school the way that we're opening up the time on Brett Kavanaugh and he's in high school and draw to challenge everything\nYou don't think it's fair to say that it would be disqualifying Brett Kavanaugh was miss characterizing his drinking habits as a teenager\nSo drinking habits as a teenager and someone saying he drank too much and the other one's saying it didn't drink too much becomes subjective issue a sexual assault is very clear\nRepublican

turn now to one of the most extraordinary developments in human history\nChina's government has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over near forty years there's never been anything like it and China's new wealth and power are changing the world\nThis week we're starting a series that explores China's reach into other countries NPR's chief international editor will Dobson joined us now to give us a preview hey well I also\nSo I understand the series is looking at China but from the vantage point of other countries why look at China from the out side\nRight well for nearly Thirty years we've been reporting on a rising China we've been following as it reaches one atomic benchmark after another\nAt some point you have to recognize that the world is changed and China's not rising anymore it's risen right what we're looking at now is not a developing country it's a major player that throws its weight around that is confident and assertive in sort of pushing its its interests and if you want to see that engagement\nYou have to be looking outside of China and how did you decide\nWhere to go to assess China's massive influence around the world well\nWe went to more than a dozen countries around the globe we went to South America Africa Europe south east Asia and what we were looking to do is not just to sort of a cheetah\nA geographic diversity we're looking at a diversity of places in terms of the countries that China is meeting so that means how China engages democracies versus how it's engaging developing economies struggling societies places\nThat are very far afield generally far out of their orbits\nAnd places that are in their strategic backyard\nAnd without telling us too much about the slaves were going to hear in the next coming days give us a fan of what you found\nWell it'd be great to start with a story that our Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz fouled up he was looking at China as meddling in Australia meddling yeah look of course China in Australia\nWe're really broad relationship or they are huge trading partners but the relationship is deeper than just goods and services he looks at a writer who was trying to write a book critical of China's influence in Australia and for the longest time he couldn't get it published in Australia\nAnd and this is sort of thing that's really remarkable here is that China's no longer content to stifle free speech just within its own borders it's now extending its influence into public fears of other countries exercising censorship in foreign country exactly\nWhere else did you guys go well in Africa are Nairobi correspondent found a massive new infrastructure project that links to of Kenya's largest cities\nNow this is something you can find many places like this it's something that can you deeply needs it's a it's been very well done and very well executed but it's now leading to greater local resentment at this Chinese operation using Chinese labor\nAnd there's fear understandable fear in Kenya that they won't be able to pay the Chinese back\nThat these Chinese projects that we're seeing spring up around the world are creating get traps that could cause future dependency\nIt's also important that China doesn't always get its way in some places they are making massive investments and these projects are hitting the skids and we have a story was that look some of the problems that can the devil even China or in Morocco\nAnd then in Europe there are concerns about China's stifling free speech fear over investment in certain high tech sectors and also there's growing concern about China investing huge amounts imports around the continent here's one analyst explaining what's worrying some in Europe\nThey've invested all along the ... face of Europe it's like almost an anaconda strategy like you could surrounded and squeeze it and that way you have some control and never ate what an ominous analogy in anaconda had exactly\nThe anaconda strategy and how China chooses to use that leverage Howitt deploys that leverage really could say everything to us about what it in a bold and China means for the rest of the world All right we'll be

by a longtime friend of hers refuted\nRefuted Kevin ... those people have received data for its recollection of what happened is that accurate\nNot quite accurate because the bulk of their statements are that they don't remember now\nThe letters vary in terms of how fat ugly they don't remember how fat ugly they deny what they think was happening in that summer but there is a big difference between not remembering refuting and it's why having\nFBI investigators get involved might help the senators drill down on this\nOkay let's try to another statement this one where Kavanaugh has been asked\nAbout drinking while he was under age\nThe drinking age was Eighteen and Marilyn's for most of my time in high school and was Eighteen in DC for all my time in high school\nAll right John did Kevin and get the law right was Eighteen the drinking age at the time in both places\nBrett Kavanaugh got it wrong from Maryland in Maryland the drinking age in the summer of Nineteen eighty two went from Eighteen to Twenty one so at the time\nIt would be very likely that Brett Kavanaugh being someone who was a less than Twenty one was not drinking legally at least for half of the summer\nThere are some moments where Kavanaugh talks about how much he drank back then he repeatedly mentioned that he liked to be here but he says as much as he liked here his drinking was not out of control here's how he put it\nI liked I still like beer but I did not drink beer to the point of walking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nHow firmly can have a nine Fifteen never drink to the point of blacking out has there been any evidence to challenge that\nSo far we've heard from people who went to high school with him college with him who said that yeah he drank a lot and that he would be a very sloppy drunk\nBut how is anyone to sort this out\nI think that it's extremely difficult because the whole nature of this is\nVery subjective it's not the sort of thing that lends itself to fact check per se I think it's it's right there on the margins of unless the guy was taken to the wrong ER and there's an official record of that\nThis is going to be extremely difficult to pin down\nJon Greenberg is a staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen its background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we're now three days and to the probe NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either\nLet's start with the big sticking point so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this as a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat set the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive an investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation\nThat said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has had a Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct that was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope where it's almost inevitable a on this question of senior a set of GPA pointed comments at Seventy Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week\nThat includes Kavanaugh's friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all\nThose allegations date back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSo I mentioned this is day three of the FBI's week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing in those three days so far\nWith the bureau itself has not provided any ah any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez uh she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witness the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much cricket side of the bureau has not reached shut the Ford at this point\nIt also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat Nick ah and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question one of course it's Kavanaugh's friend mark judge we talked a lot about him\nJudge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI up his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWell in the last twenty four hours a former friend up Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kavanaugh's representation of his of his drinking as a young man uh this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin I drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale or says Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nA but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kavanaugh did not behave that way they don't match a those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats to talk about Kevin us truthfulness about his drinking his truthfulness in his testimony that it's a something that should be looked into when the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin has had to say\nNPR's Ryan Lucas thanks Ryan thank you [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\n... thing to all things considered this afternoon on eighty nine nine key the tea in

FBI is three days into its week long investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nTo understand what a supplemental probe of this type might entail we reached out to Jack ... he's a former FBI agent he's conducted plenty of background probes into federal judges and you want me through how he\nWould go about this one if he were on the team investigating Kevin\nFirst I Would spend a lot of time trying to locate the home perhaps Dr Ford could ride around with ... we don't have much time you know we have to do it quickly if we can limit the neighborhood or the general area and we might be able to find the house\nThey're also real estate records available that the FBI would investigate\n... let me just start with the first example you would actually have Christine Blasey Ford in a card with you and jets drive around the neighborhood and see if that John's her memory to point out that have already absolutely would awesome and you would try to look for you said for plans of houses in the neighborhood yeah ... the description from her memory\nA word in her memory is there is a living room right inside the front door stairway up to a bedroom on one side and the bathroom across the hallway we're looking for that\n[noise] what else would you do judge Kavanaugh offered some written calendars from his high school years what would you do with those calendars\nOh an interview everyone on the calendar and the crucial time period is summer middle of the summer so July Nineteen eighty two\nAnd what else what else do you think is manageable to do within one week\nWell to do it quickly to do a polygraph of all three people involved and the alleged sexual assault judge Kavanaugh mark judge and a doctor for you good polygraph all three of them okay\nThere are allegations that involve Kavanaugh's behavior while under the influence of alcohol um during his younger years is it relevant would it be relevant to you if you are on this investigation to do a thorough job of his drinking habits in high school and in college [noise]\nYes cells in this instance not in all I Would want to interview him extensively about his drinking habits high school college and law school I Would want but on the interview\nDo you think the FBI in one week can turn up the information that has not already been turned up by Senate staffers who have\nYeah the background investigation I cannot what tell me why do\nI I Do because of the training the FBI yeah it's\nReally a wild staffers are good people and they work hard at backgrounds the FBI does this as its mandate we do it all over the country frequently and the agents assigned those ... own backgrounds or will train done it many times\nIt turns out the FBI finds information that raises questions about the fitness of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on a Supreme Court WIP I have a responsibility to pursue those additional leads\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case so I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and unlimited scope recording to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth was additional interviews\nDo you think the FBI has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes up about issues that weren't uh at the forefront at the beginning\nI think the FBI could request additional time if it's found new evidence new information about why the background is being conducted I think the FBI could requested however President Trump must approve the request\nJak Owens is a former FBI agent thank you very much\nAre you well ... thank you even as the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so it was only eight justices Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was that the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deal but\nInevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions among them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support cabinet unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Jacksonville",
