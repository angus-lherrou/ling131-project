potentially a new arms race\nFor Sunday October twenty first this is all things considered from NPR News\nMichelle Martin we'll hear from a columnist in Pennsylvania who's been following the clergy abuse scandal there now the federal government is getting involved\nI think a lot of Catholics and non Catholics alike are just shell shocked and are wondering when do these headlines stop pouring out\nAnd we'll meet my Sago rising STAR One man band and he's redefining genre\nI wouldn't even have you know maybe this is if they\nThursday morning everybody woke up to hear the breaking news that there was a federal us Justice Department investigation into all eight diocese and the state of Pennsylvania so I think a lot of Catholics and non Catholics alike are just shell shocked and are wondering when\nDo these headlines stop pouring out what do you think people are going through\nWell is there are a couple of perspectives that you know I've tapped into a I started writing about this on and off in two thousand two as a reporter and what I noticed was initially a lot of\nAnger toward us and how dare you\nBashed the church and that has\nFaded significantly in the last several years as I've done more reporting as as more grand jury work has come out as I've done my own investigative work on this\nIt is overwhelmingly a different story I hear from people who describe themselves as Catholics who are not disaffected who are angry who want to side with the victims who say enough is enough with the bishops you know people are wondering my goodness every time one of these headlines comes out were devastated we're heartbroken\nOr wounded were hurt and then six months we hope okay it's behind us and then it's back and now it's back again and now it's back again\nDo you think that this sense of anger and distrust do you think it goes beyond a practicing Catholic people who are connected to the Catholic Church I Wonder if it if it affects the community at large doesn't make them question what's going on in their world\nI think a lot of people it's very difficult for them to see what has now become document based ... systemic practices within this institution and not wonder what the heck\nIs going on there is a deep distrust I think in shock that this institution seems to have shown such a pattern internally a very very bad behavior and no sanctions\nIs there a sense that the federal investigation is a step in the right direction or if that optimism hard to come by right\nNow well it's hard to say right I mean anything can happen nobody knows which way a federal probe will go and whether it will yield anything but I remember talking to the victims even a couple of weeks back months back about the statute fight and\nHaving one say something on Thursday when the story broke about the federal probe which is\nI'm not holding my breath about a statute of limitations change in this state the one thing that will bring me peace if if and when federal authorities finally decide to explore whether the Catholic Church is an organized criminal network\nThat's ... ... she's a columnist with the Philadelphia Inquirer Maria thanks so much for talking with us thank you so much for having me\n[noise]\nAnd now another story in our troll watch theory [noise]\nFor this program we've been trying to keep track of the ways that Internet trolls especially those directed by foreign governments have been trying to influence American voters by pushing fake stories are hyping up stories with a partisan or mean spirited edge\nNow we've heard about an army veteran who's trying to eliminate this information on Facebook that targets service members and veterans he's flak about one hundred Facebook pages of millions of followers and he's with us now Chris Goldsmith is the assistant director for policy and government affairs at Vietnam veterans of America\nAnd he's also founder and president of high ground veterans advocacy and he's with us from NPR's bureau in New York schools with thanks so much for talking to us hey thanks for having me so let me let me ask you to walk me through this out of this started because you were trying to understand how well you are\nLegitimate Facebook pages were doing and then you realize that somebody had what stolen your logo and it was pushing content with it and had more followers and you tell me about that correct yes so\nI was just helping my communications team manage our social media pages and um I typed in Vietnam veterans of America and one day I noticed that there was another page that came up before hours and it had an even larger following\nSo I investigated the page found out that they've been using our logo pretending to be us but they were sending everyone to a European website the vets dot edu but that was the first red flag where it's you know these people aren't just trying to sell T shirts or something\nThey're creating an entire environment to support the fake Facebook pages\nIt tell me about that what kinds of things where they using their page to say\nSo most of the stuff that this particular group of trolls was pushing a we eventually located in them and in Bulgaria\nOne particular incident was there was a legitimate news story in rural Massachusetts there was\nA Vietnam veterans monument that had been defaced some kid took some berries and rubbed in on it but what they did was they took that local news story in loops the fifty second video for four hours as Facebook Live video\nAnd over that they put a phrase that said do you think the criminals must suffer and encourage people to respond\nNow it was based in truth but it was made to look more urgent and it looked like it was happening live this wasn't just you know one person in Bulgaria you know trying to build the following this was a conspiracy\nWhat I'm basically doing is is leaving a trail of bread crumbs so that Facebook's threat intelligence team can take the actual experts to analyze the data die found\nSo that they can get more information about who's behind it what\nDoes it do you think is attracting people as it is it because I could combine it with this kind of deep patriotic sentimental what's the appeal\nSo the reason why they are going to the right is because that's the type of content that the extreme right is producing organically\nSo it blends in their goal is to blend in with and amplify the extremes in this country\nThat the ultimate goal here is is not veterans it is to make the United states in a permanent condition of paralysis they want for us to not be able to function as a democracy in the way that they do that is they sabotage any\nIdea of bipartisanship not just for our elected members of Congress but for the electorate and we use a society need to start educating ourselves\nOn the issue of cyber hygiene we need to understand that it's it's very important to everything that we share we need to make sure that the source is reliable\nAnd when it comes to politics we need to make sure that it's generated from inside the United states\nThat was Chris Goldsmith the assistant director for policy and government affairs at

Adams died in fact in the letter he said quote come on this Adams you know you're not going to be around forever\nAnd that sort of sparked outrage as you can imagine that he has no real parental rights due to the prison of having been in prison for Nineteen years now\nLet me play a short clip from uh your your conversation with found out it was one of the many that you had with her over the years\nI'm Still failing forgiving\nAnd I'll what steel for him to me his son but I Do want him\nTo feel the effects of what he did 'cause that's what I've been looking at every day since November sixteenth Nineteen Ninety nine\nI should mention that chance or has multiple disability a link to the circumstances of his birth I mean the fact that his mother was short was was shot four times the fact that he was you know deprived of oxygen the fact that she was born\nUp several weeks prematurely nevertheless you said that she really made a big impression on you I Know that you've you've mentioned several times that sounded Adams has really had a big impact on you tell us about that\nShe has honestly I I mean the the love that she has for her disabled grandson is about is pure love as I've ever come in contact with I've been doing this a long time now and\nUh she is inspirational and one reason for the crude pod cast was because I wanted more people to hear her voice it's one thing to see it in print but when you hear someone talking about forgiveness for the for men and conspired to kill your daughter it's powerful\nBut in fact that's kind of where I Want to end up here which is after spending all this time following this young man you know the highs and lows and the impact that he had on this family's life did you ever come up with a ... of a sense of why why did this happen to begin with\nMy only theory is that he wasn't used to being told he couldn't do something at the end the court testimony it came out they're not here impregnated in another woman at one point and had threatened her and kind of pressured her to get an abortion and that one and she did and that worked out and then he had had this other son\nOf four or five years before\nAnd then ... Adams was absolutely adamant that she was going to have this baby I do not think he enjoyed being told no at any point in his life\nAnd so that's the only I I guess you know there's far more to it certainly been just that but I think\nThat's part of it is that you know athletes have to learn that no means no just like the rest of us need to learn it and it's a it's a lesson that I think a pro

apartment\nAnd then we actually felt the explosion from the house I Believe I ...\nAbout eighty homes into three neighboring communities Lawrence Andover in North Andover were on fire several houses
