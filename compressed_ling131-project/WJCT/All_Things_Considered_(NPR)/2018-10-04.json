planets collide she uses to actual cannons to simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large coalition knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat does rock vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry and see her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nWe are doing a job interview for someone who's going to

going\nIn and out of a secure underground room at the Capitol viewing one copy of the FBI's report on sexual assault claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe reporters confidential and reactions have been divided\nDemocrats called incomplete Republicans say it was Thoreau a final vote on Kavanaugh could take place within forty eight hours and there are just a few undecided senators for more on that we are joined by NPR's Kelsey Snell like health care as you've been talking with senators today does this report seemed to have changed anyone's mind\nIt seems to be comforting for a lot of Republicans a Senator Bob Corker announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh after a briefing this morning he talked with some of us during the day as he was heading into actually read the report for himself and he said there was nothing new there to corroborate any allegations against cabinet and he said he felt he was comfortable now\nAnd then you have people like Lindsey Graham who was a huge Kavanaugh supporter before he says if anything this report made him feel stronger about that to park here's what he said\nAnd I think after all the stronger\nIn terms of understanding the facts before and I am ready to vote\nBut what about those three undecided senators we've been talking about all week what have you heard from them\nYeah we're focused still on Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona those three Republicans are really critical here\nMurkowski has mostly been ducking reporter I think he's gone in and out reading that report for much of the day others like Susan Collins of Maine and flake\nThey say they haven't said exactly how that felt but they both say they found this report helpful\nCollins called a thorough and flake who is one of the people who actually called for this investigation he told reporters he thought it was Thoreau as well and he says he hasn't seen any new corroborating evidence which is the thing that he said before you know it'd be a yes if that was the case if there wasn't that corroborating evidence that would be found\nThere was still kind of reading the tea leaves on how they're going to vote what about the contents of this report how much we learned about what's in it\nI think virtually nothing because they can't tell us anything it is confidential it has left behind closed doors in the basement is the capital\nAnd we what we do know is that it's about forty five pages and they spoke to about nine people and NPR has confirmed the names of six of them and most of those people are friends of cat on Fort from high school\nThey also spoke with Deborah Ramirez who was a classmate at Yale\nAnd she's the one who she is having a drunken Lee exposing himself to her in the early to mid eighties\nSo like I said they thought one copy and the senators are just circulating through and telling us that and you know that these are mostly interviews and I'm a transcription and some of the conversations that they had we also know that Ford and Kavanaugh were not interviewed so they are not a part of this and denser pretty upset about that [noise]\nSo senators now have the report the Senate majority leader has said he wants a vote in the next forty eight hours what happens in that time\nUh sometime likely tomorrow morning there will be a procedural vote that is necessary for them to move on they need ... votes to pass that and that makes this a really key test because fifty one of those cars all it takes to approve his confirmation\nAnd that coming up so if they can get to the fifty one votes now very likely they'll be able to get to it and wants to find them though comes up\nAnd you know it it it well it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their mind after procedurals like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have that right now and they can afford to lose one person and still approve Kavanaugh because president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker than a final they'll come to about thirty hours later that means sometime maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final though\nHe'll say we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed the Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats in great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and their eagerly accordingly and there and this has energized then the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that skill Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this is in the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if a half an hour to get confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much\n... as well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he wants to Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the
