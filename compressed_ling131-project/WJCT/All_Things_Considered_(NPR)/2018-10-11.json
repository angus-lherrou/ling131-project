Arizona I think we can improve our position with women voters which is about voters for sure\nWith African Americans we haven't been able to make much although I think it is noteworthy that a temp Scott is a member of our conference and he used the arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina so there is hope with African American voters as well but I'm a more optimistic about closing the gender gap\nAnd by improving our position was Hispanic\nYou're looking ahead we talked to three and a half weeks away from this election how many Republicans will be in the Senate next year now you know I'm not gonna [laughter] I'll\nSay out of their production business\nSometimes the non answers are telling that was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell speaking with our Kelsey Snell on Capitol Hill today and Kelsey was there anything else he just wouldn't answer\nWell yeah I think it's important to note that this is a a longer interview that we kind of ... it down for a time and he and I talked about a lot and\nOne of the things he did that really struck me is that he voted criticizing President Trump Adam and most issues particularly on the economy and on President Trump's comments from last night that the fed is crazy for raising interest rates McConnell just wouldn't go there\nAnd in that section about health care when we heard him say it was a major failure he didn't say it to fight he wants to repeat and that's not what a lot of conservatives want to hear they wanted to hear that and Republicans are going to go back if they still have control and try again to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd on that same issue we got into an extended conversation about Republicans and protections for people with preexisting condition okay\nTwo Senate candidates are involved in lawsuits to weaken those protections and he told me that Republicans are campaigning on keeping those protections and gave a contradictory response about how they can support those lawsuits but still want protections in place\nAnd one thing that looked out at me listening they're back to your health care point he described as a failure to pass health care overhaul is the only major disappointment and I was thinking I can think of others but what about comprehensive immigration reform they wanted to get that done it's not done\nThat really wasn't on his list and you know I haven't been on the list for a lot of Republicans that I've talked to a who worked on immigration many of them said that they still hold out hope that immigration could be part of a broader conversation later in the year potentially around spending\nI'm speaking of spending and speaking of immigration did you ask about the border wall which people are talking about again funding for Trump's border wall with Mexico\nYeah I asked him if he thought there was going to be a shutdown fight in December over the border wall with Mexico he says he wants to try to get funding for the wall but he's talking about a lot less money than House Republicans he\nSaid about you know money for about one year roughly the amount that they've been spending on border security altogether and now that's not the big down payment or major investment that some in the house are talking about and that sets up the possibility of an immigration conversation other big spending fight\nOne other thing that you that you raised with him was women and where women are left post Kavanaugh's confirmation battle he acknowledge that there's always been something of a gender gap in terms of voters for ... for Republicans and acknowledge that is going to be a challenge\nYeah absolutely and he said that he is going to make an effort to get more women on the Senate Judiciary committee next year he says he's asked in the past and he's going to ask okay\nAll right NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell talking about her interview today with Mitch McConnell are there on Capitol Hill Kelsey thanks so much thank you\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nEl and you're listening to all things considered this afternoon on eighty nine nine W.

Elliott joins us now from Panama City one of the places hard hit by the storm communications are still difficult there but we think we have the right Debbie hey their pride I'm here to tell us why did it like there now\nWell it's better destruction and you know I've covered a lot of hurricanes and then this probably one of a you know the ones I have\nWhat they are in the top ranked in terms of just every where you look\nThere is something wrong nothing is right um you know people here talk a little bit about losing their bearings in some places because things are gone trees are snapped into their down everywhere they're on top and through all kinds of structures\nThat huge metal light posts are just twisted like they're a crumpled papers straw ribs have been ripped from buildings windows have been blown out and when you try to go down any street um they're covered by felt trees or power poles\nThey're also all kinds of debris on the roadways their power lines down just random stuff like street signs or glass or a chunk of the billboard it's a it's very difficult terrain\nWow what a picture you paint it what about rescue effort how are they going so far\nWell uh it's been difficult to get to people but they're under way I'm right now people that that the that\nThose front lift things I'm the word I'm losing it but they're trying to clear the roads of all the stuff so that emergency vehicles can get through there are lots of power trucks here but the power trucks get get to work of course until um the the that things are back\nOut of the way for them to get to where they can put the power lines back up so right now it's just a matter of trying to get everything out of the way so that that the work to for recovery can began but the bigger issue is getting to people who need help\nAnd have you been able to talk to a lotta people affected by hurricane I mean how are they holding up\nKnow I think right now people are just trying to figure out what's next for

illuminate hundreds of ... so it's enough to live your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in the debate that to actually identify you\nAbout ten years before the first official coming out day coming out was really made a political action by Harvey Milk a name I'm sure you know right the first openly gay member of the board of supervisors exactly he was an icon for the community and in this speech you gave in Seventy eight he basically call them all of America to come out\n\nCome out [noise]\nYour immediate\nGoing to be there all your life so\nClearly you know you have Harvey Milk here stake in this line in the sand but if you really want to get to where the energy for the gay rights movement and coming out came from you could track at all the way back to where the root for the civil rights movement and gay rights movement and women's rights movement came from which was post World war two activism started by black soldiers\nOkay so you're taking it all the way back down to the Nineteen forties\nHarvey Milk was this huge inspiration in the seventies then coming out day gets foreign allies in the eighties it was just thinking of any I mean this is it gets formalized in the decade that was that was turbulent and scary and and really heartbreaking for much of the gay community\nYeah in many ways it was awful for the gay community this you know he was in the throes of the AIDS crisis you had this groundswell of activism from the algae BTU community over the issue while the government was very silent\nOr in the same decade in eighty six you had the Supreme Court uphold a state law from Georgia again sodomy which allowed gay sex to be treated as a felony and so the thinking was is coming out day was the thing that happened and it proved that people had gay and lesbian folks in their lives everywhere and you know them\nSome of the way the law treated them or ignored them would have to change\nIt feels like a lot has changed I mean let me ask you is coming out with the same kind of moment now to marketing it coming out day feel as necessary\nYeah I think the answer depends on who you ask but for me it felt very very different in large part\nBecause the language that we have around sexuality and gender is constantly evolving you know a thing that we talk about in the episode is how the increased prominence of queer identity of trans identity of people declaring themselves and their sexuality in these ways that are new to many people\nThat almost doesn't fit what you could call the old model of coming out and there's also you know this phenomenon we go we go from Ellen coming out some Twenty years ago I went to artists exactly to artists like Frank Ocean\nWho came out but then use the word gay or Janelle Monet who didn't come out as gay or lesbian or by she came out as pan sexual\nIt's just a different language in a different rubric almost so of course that just changes what coming out is\nDid you walk away from that forming an opinion about yourself\n[noise] um I think it helped me in my own coming out story to stop being angry about how long it took or feeling guilty about my path of my process and just feeling a bit more proud of who I Am and there's I don't know there was this feeling throughout the entire episode where\nThe listeners we talked to coming out is not just declaring yourself to the world\nIt is declaring herself to every earlier version of yourself and tell them that person they're cool too\nThat's NPR's Sam Sanders you can check out his whole episode on the history of coming out and what

Mary Louise Kelly we're going to talk now about the man behind a name you have been hearing a lot these last few days\nJamal ... he used the Saudi journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week\nAnd then disappeared was never seen walking up prompting reports that he was kidnapped or maybe murdered by a hit squad flown in from Riyadh for that express purpose\nBut who is or was ... and why would he had been seen as posing such a danger to the Saudi regime that is such an extraordinary operation would have been put in motion\nOr we're going to put those questions now to shutting ... of the Brookings Institution welcome high tax revenue glad to have you with us All right we know some basic facts Jamal because she'll give age fifty nine\nA that he's an editor or that he's a critic of his government and Saudi Arabia [noise] what else should we know about him\nSo the interesting thing about him is that he wasn't always a dissident and he was actually a consummate insider with close connections to the Saudi royal court that's what makes this different this is someone who came from the inside and then decided that he could no longer support new Saudi policies under a new leadership\nAnd he left Saudi Arabia in June twenty Seventeen he went into exile he came to the yeah came to the U.S\nAnd started writing for the Washington Post what did he write that would have annoyed the Saudi regime so much\nSo one of his pieces that is getting a lot of attention now in retrospect he wrote in September twenty Seventeen where he basically announced his break\nWith Saudi Arabia is the factor leader Mohammed bin Salman also known as NBS the crown prince ... and he supported some of the general reforms that MBBS was trying to put forward including\nMore rights for women but he felt that if Saudi Arabia was going to go through a transformation that the people had to be part of the conversation and the Saudi leadership and NBS in particular increasingly moved in a direction where\nThey didn't want any questioning of this new direction\nAnd ... he couldn't bring himself to agree with that and I think that he was pained to have this break with the Saudi regime he didn't want it\nAs you look back over what he wrote what he did what he said over the last year or two was there a moment where it appeared he'd crossed a line on was starting\nTo put himself into danger you know I don't know if we can point to one moment\nI think we can say that he had become\nThe most prominent Saudi dissident but more importantly the most prominent Saudi dissident in the west I mean the fact that he wrote regularly for the Washington Post\nThe fact that he knew many and the policy community in DC so I think he was the one person who could credibly and effectively I'm casting doubt on Mohammed bin Salman man's vision for Saudi Arabia at a time\nWhen Mohammed bin Salman or NBS as he's called was really trying to portray himself as this young reformer and the young reformers that America should ... wagging to this is interesting\nBecause because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin Salman is taking at what you're describing is why he might have been seen as a\nAs a more of a danger than others but he had such a platform that he was so well connected in Washington and an outside of Saudi Arabia\nAnd he's coming from within Saudi society he knows the major players and and leaders in the Saudi royal court so it's different you know if I criticize Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if ... ah did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family\nDoes it strike you as puzzling though I mean the reports are being source to Turkish officials Turkish investigators saying that the team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting ... that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics\nCan you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials say it did\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifferent says almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\nShadi Hamid thanks so much for having me and my pleasure Shadi Hamid is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution we have been talking about Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal ...\nNow ... disappearance and possible murder is draining relations between Washington and Riyadh and it comes at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S and
