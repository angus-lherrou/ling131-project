Saudi Arabia we're going to go to Ben Hubbard he's been covering this story for the New York times welcome thank you so putting aside how credible the current explanation is for a show these death\nHow unusual is it for the royal family to publicly changes explanation for anything\nWell I Would say that they're not always professionals that communication this is a monarchy this is a place where this was in the ... state as well and the most likely they're in charge of all the media so when it comes out to communicate with other people they can pretty much say whatever they want that gets a little bit more complicated when they have to communicate with the rest of the world which I think is what we're seeing now\nWhat about within Saudi Arabia how is fallout from ... playing out there is there any fallout\nHum as far as we know there isn't enough for the simple reason that nobody has much of a say in anything that happens except the crown prince and the cook to father who is the king\nSo there have been sort of these two dwelling images\nOf the crown prince there's this image of a man who has worked quite actively to consolidate his power but then there's also this other image of a man who's tried to bring modernizing progressive changes to society like letting women drive which image using Saudis buy into more\nThink it's one of the things that made him such\nA fascinating character to watch is really these two sides um and and I do think that the social things he wants to do are genuine I Do believe that he wants women to drive I Do believe that he wants to diversify the economy I Do believe that he wants to change the religious rhetoric away from some of the extremism and um\nIt's safe to say that there were lots of people in Saudi Arabia source or young people who were very excited about the social changes that he wanted to make [noise]\nBut I think people are also very aware of the flip side of this I mean I have many many Saudi friends with a lot of people that\nKeep in touch with them a lot of them are very scared you know again one of the best examples that we've seen that this was the fact that somebody like democracy who he who had worked for members of the royal family and then sort of part of that elite society decided that it was time to get out of town and go live in Virginia\nYou report it over the weekend about the tremendous turmoil all of this has caused with in the royal family who besides the crown prince his father king sound mind could exert any meaningful pressure on the crown prince to change course at this point\nIt doesn't appear that there is anybody um and we really have to differentiate between the leadership of the kingdom which I Would say is the is the king and the crown prince with the with the crown prince being the one who's doing the day to day management of the kingdom and the rest of the royal family I mean the royal family is a huge sprawling family we're talking\nThousands and thousands of princes princes\nOr what you did you have in Saudi Arabia before this current leadership came into play was a much more of a consensus system of governing the place uh-huh throughout Saudi Arabia's history you've had kind of a group of top princes who shared the big portfolios weather was defense domestic security\nBomb and Vincent man has very effectively demolished that system he has sort of dismantled all of the other power centers in the kingdom and put everything under himself\nWell do you think the crown prince has been taken aback genuinely by the blowback he's gotten because of what happened to Christianity\nThe report in that we have suggested he has that he he has just been completely blown away by how large the story has gotten in by how much it means to people I mean at the end of the day the guy wasn't an American citizen he was a Saturday and so I think he's been quite surprised by it all\nBen ... is the ... bureau chief for the New York times thank you

governor's race which will decide who oversees redistricting in the state and a U.S Senate race do play a crucial role in deciding which party has control\nFlorida once again looks like it's headed

range nuclear forces arms control treaty now president Ronald Reagan signed the treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nFor the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire class of us and Soviet nuclear missiles here\nWith me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president as NPR national security correspondent David Welna welcome to the studio ... okay so the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty or we can call the INS what does history to actually do\nWell you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S in the Soviet Union had nuclear tipped missile deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could research targets in only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty record the destruction of all these intermediate range land base nuclear missiles once and for all and it really was the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nNow President Trump says Russia has not been in compliance with the treaty do we know this is true\nWell you know U.S officials beginning with President Obama four years ago have been saying that Russia has been cheating on this treaty\nThat Russia's been deploying some land base intermediate range cruise missiles that could strike targets in Eastern Europe in violation of the treaty but Obama did not want to kill this arms control treaty figuring that it's so provided a means for talking with the Russians at least\nOf course Ronald Reagan Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nBut you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal\nI think this really shows that the Russia hawks and administration are getting their way and it's not the state department is doing this even though that's traditionally where such policies are carried out this bears the hallmarks of national security adviser John Bolton\nHe's never liked arms control deal he wrote in two thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and Bolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response from the Russian government\nAre not great Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei rep cough was quoted yesterday by the Russian news agency task says calling this move blackmail by the U.S he also called it a very dangerous step\nIs there any chance that Russia can gain something from the U.S falling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons\nPhilip twelve the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remember thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has a stockpile ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the ... might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and proper like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to joined the eye and after us started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since Nineteen seventies the trust has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stalled nuclear arms race get going again\nAfter all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna David thank you for your reporting You're welcome Audi\nResidents of the Florida Panhandle are still

certainly acting in his view according to the rules\nThat's attorney Robert ... who's asking the state Supreme Court to overturn Jones's conviction\nIt seems implausible that the intent of the electorate was that the only way that that medication could be administered to them would be by smoking a joint\nBut that's in effect what the ruling means under the court's logic many of the state's one hundred eighty thousand medical marijuana patients are committing felonies\nClearly there's a lot at stake\nSo how does this happen with a product sold for years even regulated by the state\nThe legal dispute centers on whether Arizona's medical marijuana act first passed by voters as a ballot measure and twenty ten includes cannabis extracts Sheila Polk up prosecutor and one of Arizona staunchest photos of marijuana says no in fact it's her office they went after Rodney Jones\nThis case affirmed away candidates has always been treated in this county by my office which is that it's a narcotic drug\nMany dispute her interpretation but it's unclear how many other prosecutors are now following her lead poke believes medical marijuana supporters are taking advantage of the ballot box by pushing initiatives that voters don't fully understand\nThey weren't contemplating that manufactures would be extracting one chemical from that marijuana plant to make this you know mind blowing product\nArizona is a cautionary tale about the possible fallout abusing the ballot instead of state legislators to craft marijuana reform law's says Rob Mike as he's a law professor at Vanderbilt University and says these measures aren't always comprehensive you're opening the door\nTo those opponents to revisit the issue on and exploit those gas\nMichigan for example only clarified in twenty

protest but presidents in the past have used this power to hold up the the countries they don't believe are acting in us interest\nNow aside from his authority some of the experts I spoke with said it would be counterproductive for President Trump to follow through on this trip they say cutting off aid might just make conditions in the Central American countries worse and create an even bigger push for people to try to pack up and scrape for the north\nNow has called on Mexico to stop the caravan and said that if that doesn't happen he will call up the U.S military and close the southern border I mean he is commander in chief so can he unilaterally do that Trump\nOther presidents have mobilized the national guard in the past uh usually in cooperation with state governors you might remember that President Trump mobilized about four thousand guard troops this past spring to lend a hand with more security in general those guard troops have been playing a support role they're not actually patrolling were sealing the border but also that's\nReally the point you know the migrants the president's been talking about are not as a rule trying to evade the border patrol on the country they have been deliberately turning themselves in when they reached the border and asking for asylum so it's not really clear what bringing in more troops would actually accomplish\nHe's trying to turn away migrants if they don't first apply for asylum in Mexico can enforce fat\nLongstanding federal and international law says immigrants who present themselves at the border\nHave the right to seek protection as refugees at least to apply for it and that's what many of the Central American migrants have been doing many of them are also doing so in family groups and that has posed a challenge for the administration because it limits we've talked a lot about on detaining ... young people for example\nWe have seen a surge in the number of family groups crossing the border illegally but we have to keep this in perspective overall the level of illegal border crossings\nIs still way down from its high point around the year two thousand\nAnd finally as we heard in the interview with reporter deems Frederick migrant advocates are refuting Trump's description of the caravan is being led by Democrats what you know about that charge are these threats just a ploy ahead of the new term elections\nThe the president has been claiming without evidence that Democrats want open borders a lot of Democrats a point to the two thousand Thirteen bipartisan bill that passed the Senate that actually would have substantially beefed up border security\nBut that said this is certainly an energizing issue for the president's base and so it's no surprise he's stressing if not only on his Twitter feed but at the campaign rallies he's been holding around the country with just over two weeks to go before the midterm elections\nAll right That's NPR's Scott Horsley thanks Scott You're welcome\nFor years airline passengers have complained of being squeezed into ever narrow our seats with shrinking leg room\nNow a new law requires the Federal Aviation administration to set a minimum size receipts and like room problem is the law doesn't specify what the minimum size or spacing should be from Chicago NPR's David Schaper reports\nPoor people are flying today than ever before when adjusted for inflation air fares are historic low technology is helping airlines lose fewer bags and improve there on time for for\nA lot of there's one thing that air travel are still love to complain about the size of economy class the thirty year old Jose Maldonado who was six foot three and flew to Chicago from Miami says it's not just that there's no leg room\nBut you know he's\nNot

it allows them to keep fares low and remain profitable but Paul Hudson of the group flyers writes dot org says the shrinking seats in tightening pitch which is the distance between your seat in the one in front of you\nNot only make flying uncomfortable but it poses a safety hazard\nWithout proper regulation I'm afraid it's going to get worse and worse until there are real disaster\nBut this summer the FAA rejected flyers writes petition asking\nThe agency to set a minimum seat size and pitch\nRuling that the smallest space airlines currently used a mirror twenty eight inches on some carriers is roomy enough to allow for the safe evacuation of a plane in Ninety seconds or less\nEnter Congress which included a provision in the recently passed at the reauthorization act ordering the agency do establish minimum seeding dimensions\nHudson says that law doesn't actually mandate BFA to give airline passengers more room\nIt could potentially freeze a where they are even worse\nIt is unlikely that the industry will be pushed to upper first\nMarissa Garcia used to design aircraft interiors now writes about the aviation industry\nAnd the reason for that is that it would be an extremely competitive situation for them\nForcing the airlines with the least leg room like deep discounters spirited frontier to yank out rows of seats to meet any new rule could cost a million to drive up fares and Garcia says the Trump Administration is calling on federal agencies to repeal regulations not add to them\nIt's that kind of what will the fake it which they follow one and two we do speculation on the mandate to increase the elation\nThat's why Garcia and others expect yesterday I Will not give air travelers any more space or leg room anytime soon but at least it might finally stop the shrinking of airline seats David Schaper NPR News Chicago [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n... oh\nYou're listening to all things considered this afternoon on
