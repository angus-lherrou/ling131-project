I got an area and I'd like to do what they are\nI'm not sure which way to photo rate do that is Arthur tribes supporting remember where we\nAre the tribes supporting them and three are basically when it comes to amendments three uh the yes the tribes are foreign penetrated a double check a yes the seminal try this for a minute three correct Eric the dog tracks the NFL teams the sports betting firms are against it\nAfter I'd actually in the ... to try to drive but as the tribe is sixteen million dollar more than sixty million dollars in saying that they want this to pass so they're they're\nVery yeah very for it OK yeah and then you you had to and you had a question about Thirteen as well\nYes on for pain it's not something that's going to happen today but what would make a lot of sense to me is why don't we use people instead of do I mean people run track what a battle people you know I have like ... [laughter]\nI'm Serious and he had a you mean like at the Olympics and then bet on it\nOr more like your your regular whether college for ... yeah yeah\nAnd people you know that after ... ... it wouldn't be as profitable as as right now where they get the dog basically for free but um\nTo me that would make a lot more ... more noble real on a member for which you're not talking about it may be more and more than a year for for governor for her 'cause you can ... franchise over Marion\nYes thank you for that Anthony I didn't mean to laugh at your idea um yeah I mean why not um yes amendment for which does lead to a beyond paste\nWould restore fell on voting rights\nEric uh we haven't gotten into that on this program although we have another shows that now let's point out all of these amendments Eric require sixty percent voter approval so a ... most of them are probably not going to make it hard to say but you know it's a it's a high bar right\nIt is it is a high bar of you know speaking with the um the folks who actually John Oregon and then pull our who were responsible for the uh medical marijuana amendment that passed and sixteen they tried that in fourteen\nAnd twelve and fourteen election which was a mid term one of the reasons why it failed discuss it was a midterm voters aren't out that much um it's it's just harder it's harder to get the number of people out there so you can get the ratio that you need you need that sixty percent I'm that's why you're going to see the uh uh legalization of marijuana will likely be on the twenty twenty about\nThose are the big amendment so yeah but when in a midterm election it's it's it's it's pretty tough to get it passed which actually brings you to the amendment three debate to which 'cause it's not easy to do uh to do a referendum\nIt it yeah it's tough now when it comes to these gambling and dog racing amendments do based on what you you reported do you think either one of them is likely to pass\nOr not based on what I've seen the polling uh\nThere's there's polling that will show of the amendment three will definitely ... the most reliable polling that I've seen of a mammoth Thirteen has been a that it's going to be shaky\nSo that one of the biggest problem we have that we do have so many amendments on the ballot and people who actually will get kind of literally they just stopped they stopped really care for a while yeah yeah\nYeah or even a yeah it's you know as one of the callers yeah\nRight because it's at the end of the ballot it's the last one on there a exactly so uh you know but judging by the volume of calls we've received from all over Florida we can't even get to the mall Coral Springs Miami Jacksonville St john's or\nA veto lots of people waiting to weigh in on the on a minute Thirteen which would phase out greyhound racing in the state of Florida by twenty twenty we just don't have time unfortunately to get to every one but\nThere were folks waiting on hold other veterinarians people that want it to a express their support for continuing greyhound racing in in Florida so\nUh this is such an intense issue or a well we'll wait to see if it translates into a lot of ballots cast on this or as you said it is the last time and on the ballot Eric so people need to Wade through it But Eric a stark has seen a political Florida\nWe thank you so much for being on the show today Thanks for being with us\nI think he was an honor\nAnd that is our show today the floor to round up is produced by W.

they have differences with a little more compassion and respect David Schaper NPR News Fort Lauderdale\nAs we heard Cesar say I allegedly sent pipe bombs to individuals and a news organization CNN that President Trump frequently criticize last night though the president bristled ethic gestures that his rhetoric is to blame for what he called the sinister actions of one individual\nBut we want to if it's fair to ask if his tone has created a climate conducive to violence like the mail bombs or the carnage at a synagogue today\nI talk about this with professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson an expert on political discourse at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of communication we talking about the complaint of critics that President Trump has normalized and quote unquote other ring of people\nAttacks on political opponents as enemies\nThe president the United states has a unique capacity to determine what are accepted political norms of discourse\nAnd to the extent that spans those outside the normal boundaries he says to everyone else those expanded boundaries are now boundaries in which you can not only speak but speaking public and not be afraid of sanctions and for that we have told Donald Trump accountable\nI mentioned you that we've been traveling around the state of this week meeting with all kinds of people I spoke with a group of Trump supporters were going to hear from them a later this weekend\nThey profess not to have heard any of the president's attacks on individual the media I you know I was asking them about the tone that the president sets but they profess not to hurt any of that\nWe all live to some extent within our own like minded communities and when we live inside our own media bubble were far more likely to see the world through the filter that it offers so to the extent that the president is saying things that have been normalized inside that constituency they're not going to remember it specifically it's going to be a background assumption\nThere have been any device of moments in American history of any violent moments I mean assassinations politically motivated bombings the civil war for that matter how old are you you can ... the scare as a person who studied communication throughout our history\nThe difference between then and now is it now exists in an environment in which these horrific acts that is bombs were sent to people yielded two and a half or so days of people asking whether or not these were fake or not\nWhether or not Donald Trump was or was not to blame for them but it suggests as we've lost our capacity to be horrified by the sort of action was lost our ability to say whether they were Democrats or Republicans we disapprove of this action profoundly\nAnd we're going to ask if the climate that is conducive to it something that we are in any way contributing to for example when someone's driving around with a van with\nPictures that suggests ... member him at the pictures that show people in the crosshairs of a gun\nThat that was normalized enough in a community that that person thought it was acceptable to drive around with that van and then I tend to rally in park that van go to a rally where some of those sentiments within the audience were expressed on T shirts how we manage to normalize that so much that in this moment we couldn't come together and say\nWhoever did this this is highly problematic we disapprove of it and we are going to look at the broader culture and ask how we minimize the likelihood that will ever happen again\nThat is

more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia you may have hurt other colleagues some NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about that\nDo you feel that Donald Trump is a factor in your race\nI think the national figures unfortunately are factors in every race what my job is is when I talk to voters to let them know that elections or a decision in a choice between two candidates in these certain brands of government\nNow independence as it pertains to to going in both directions including the direction of the White House is very important because my beliefs as a problem solver member of the problem solvers caucus is that\nWe are checks we believe that checks are what the system is designed to have but a check has to go in both directions if you have a situation where you have President Trump in the White House in ... closest speaker you can't just have a check going in one direction the checks got to go in both directions\nIf you go back to Congress and you are in the minority how will that sit with you\nThe only thing I care about is that we have a block of good people and that's what causes about that are going to drive the solutions that's the primary importance when we're in a position where we're supporting democratic members of our caucus that should tell you our view right I mean it's not so much who holds the majority it's for the ... going to be setting the agenda in Congress\nAnd is it true that you have committed to only voting for a speaker who will sign on to our family to gridlock orange we break the gridlock in Congress has agreed to that and if there is no Republican who signs on to that would you vote for a Democrat for speaker\nSo here's what we agreed as a group to do that we are only going to support a candidate that supports these proposals\nIs it difficult for you though being a Republican part of the Republican caucus given the way the president conducted\nI think both parties need to have strong sensors in them and I think if either party is hijacked by the fringe on one side of the other that's a bad thing\nDo you see a way out of it out of the the current atmosphere\nIt's up to each and every one of us starts at the kitchen table and it goes to the White House and everyone in between uh how we talk to each other the tone use whether review differences of opinion as strengths to harness rather than weakness is to be criticized I was very very blessed to grow up in a very diverse\nCommunity and I carry that with me to the FBI and one problem solving model that we had in the FBI was anytime we had a time sensitive crime problem\nWe what's around the table with people from completely different backgrounds different educational backgrounds different professional backgrounds coming from different parts of the country different regions of the world invariably everybody based on the\nFamily they grew up in the city they grew up in where they went to school what they studied pain they may have felt that you and I couldn't fathom\nThat all that's how they approach problems and we put all that together and it always allowed us to get one step ahead of that criminal by pulling everybody's unique\nPerspective together and that's essentially what the problem solvers caucuses it's a legislative version of that\nAnd I tell everybody I mean if you ever had a chance to sit on a one of those meetings you'll be so proud of your country because you honestly guy cannot tell who the Democrats or Republicans are that room you know when I leave Congress whenever that is or run or whatever circumstances that is I just want to be able to say\nThat I did my part when I was there to advance that\nBelief that we got to get rid of this judging people based on what books they checked on their voter registration form when they're Eighteen we got to get past that\nHarrison thanks so much for for talking to us today\nThank you and WHYY stave Davies is still with us for a couple more seconds ... congressman fitzpatrick almost went to ... took pains to identify more as a member of the No Labels group or the problem solvers conscious than he did but the Republican Party what do you make that\nShe has a case to make 'cause he's an independent who voted against the repeal of Obamacare he's gotten support support from gun control groups Democrats like India and he will help the Republicans keep control of committee assignments and small legislation and nothing Democrats care about will ever get to vote and that's what matters\nThat are WHYY state David stay thank you so much for being with us today good to be with\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nAnd we are continuing to learn more about the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning the attack took place at the tree of life congregation were ... morning services were being held eleven people were killed and six others were injured Adam hurts meant was a member of the congregation he's now the director of marketing but the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh\nIs with us on the line now Mr Huntsman words I Do not have words to express my grief actual loss I'm so very sorry\nThank you very much I really appreciate that\nCan you tell us any more about how you found out about the shooting\nI found out about it but it was a little bit of help that a ... really\nDo you know if you know of anyone who was hurt\nI I don't uh unfortunately this time ah as far as I Know are they still have not been able to notify or the families of those who've died and so uh so so far nobody knows the identity of\nWhat you tell us about the congregation that kind of ... was it what stands out from your time there but\nAll of a tree of life a was a combination of two synagogues in Pittsburgh emerged to conservative synagogue so really lovely welcoming place um it's in the heart of ... which is\nA central part of the Jewish community a lot of the population of George Pittsburgh in school I'll just a wonderful warm and welcoming place\n[noise] and I wanted to ask you about this this has to just strike at your core\nAnd forgive me this news is so fresh probably even haven't had time to process it but I I just wonder what's going to your mind and then at a time like this I mean did you this is ... strike at your sense of safety as an American as an American Jew I just I'm just wondering how you are processing that's\nReally a I'm a shock to anybody in this community you know the truth is that\nUh we're lucky in Pittsburgh that generally Pittsburgh Jewish community is a one of the safest Jewish communities in the United states um we've had a community security director for a couple of years who's really been improving\nSecurity at the synagogue on that church agencies and so this comes as even more of a shock to me and everybody here\n[noise] how do you think you'll process this in the next couple of days\nThat's hard to tell him we are having a a community gathering a tomorrow at ... pm a that's a\nReally all of the synagogues and Pittsburgh are participating and\nI think in my mind it's time to come together joined together with the community I feel like a Jewish Pittsburgh has a family and so this attack really does feel like a an attack on my own family\nAnd and finally how how can others in the community support you I'm sure there are many grieving with who are not Jewish what can they do to support you at this time\nWe've had an amazing\nPouring of support both from the church community and the non Jewish community all over Pittsburgh\nOr even now you know just a a couple hours after this terrible incidents um local businesses came out with food for our grief center and gotten tax than emails from churches I think that uh\nYou know the best thing to do is to come together and help the community feel some people want to give we're going to open an aftershock bought a closes a fund for victims of terror and uh they are certainly contribute\nTo them to leave it there for now Mr Hudson thank you very much for speaking with us it's such a sensitive
