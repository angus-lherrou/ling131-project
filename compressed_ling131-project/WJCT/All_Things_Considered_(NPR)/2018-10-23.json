know the Saudis say that these Eighteen men who were arrested will face justice in Saudi course\nBut it's not altogether clear that there'll be allowed to properly defend themselves or if their testimony will be public these are high ranking military and security officials\nYou know if they're seen as scapegoats there could be a backlash what hasn't changed in the kingdom is there are still dissidents in jail including a group of women activists who haven't been charged so this atmosphere of crackdown continues\nUm you know now that the Saudis have said that ... is dead that this was a

speaking to us from Princeton University and also NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul Thanks to you both thanks thanks president\nTrump's national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he reiterated the administration's announcement from this weekend that the U.S does intend to withdraw\nFrom the thirty year old nuclear non proliferation treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and the cow Gorbachev today in Moscow Bolden said the treaty has outlived its purpose\nSo there's a new strategic reality after the Cold War bilateral thoughts to national related treaty in a multi polar\nJoining us now to talk about what all of this will mean is Melissa ... at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies ... nuclear weapons expert and joins us now thank you thanks for having me so is what John Bolton saying accurate is this treaty passed\nIts prime [noise] no not in any way I I'm surprised that he's even using that language this treaty is about protecting Europe\nSo the U.S and Soviet Union of first agreed to this and Nineteen eighty seven at one of the really darkest points in their history um because these missiles carrying nuclear warheads we're really a threat to Western Europe\nAnd so the U.S wanted to protect allies by limiting the Soviet union's ability to deliver nuclear weapons to them\nHow we pulling out of history to be a bad idea right now for security in Europe\nWhen they originally created\nThis agreement the idea was that the Soviet Union wouldn't be able\nTo prevent NATO members from coming to each other's aids because of the threat of their nuclear intermediate range missiles\nAnd that's still true today and so the fallout from these ah statements from the Trump Administration has really\nMulti fold no one uh there was no advance notice that we know of to any European allies or NATO\nSo there's going to be a lot of infighting and handwringing over what NATO should do and\nTo uh Europe and I would say at this point Russia and China and the whole world are really worried about what this means largely for for treaties an arms control agreements around the world\nI Want to take on Bolton statement about how this is now a mole type polar world let's talk about China how China's missile capabilities factor into the Trump administration's decision to pull out of this treaty\nSo it's true that the u._s. is concerned that China might use what's called a dump on twenty six to hit Guam where the U.S has military installation or to hit an aircraft carrier and not what the U. S. is kind of considered about um with China\nThe problem is that China was never a party of this agreement so really they don't have any restrictions on building these kinds of missiles and you know if if the U.S wants to negotiate with China a similar kind of deal then they can do so\nCould point out of this treaty complicate U.S Russia relations at this point\nCertainly they both holds today just as they did back in Nineteen eighty seven the largest amount of nuclear weapons in the world and it's in their self interest to prevent other states or non state actors from getting as many nuclear weapons as they do and how worried\nShould the average citizen ... who's watching all of this play out right now does leaving this treaty in your opinion make the world less safe\nFor a long time people really believe that international agreements where the best way to create peace and stability in the world you didn't have to like your partner in a treaty but you could still\nA deal with them and you could believe that they would obey the terms of the agreement and you could verify that\nAnd you could retaliate if they didn't do\nBut a lot of those rules are going out the window and increasingly under the Trump Administration and under potent and Xi Jinping we're seeing more strong arm moves and so what's more worrying for me is that we may go back to a time when whoever has the biggest missile\nThe largest warhead is the one that has the security and um that really takes us back to some dark times that many people worked very hard to prevent\n...

asylum\n\nShe says I came with my two brothers and sisters [noise] but as American forces blocked the bridge into that country her family said they were leaving the caravan one brother turned around

dollars in the family didn't have enough money for Betty and a five year old son Justin\n...\nAnd all that among them by me my my ...\nIt's really hard she says we don't have a mom she dies it's hard

five hundred limb purists a week\nTwenty dollars that was nearly half of what a shot may muggings threats if she didn't pay\nThey take Justin and will go down that\nThe pain is so huge she says the kids suffer\nBut she says they can't go back to hunter is even though she's heard about families being separated at the U.S border right now Justin seems to be having fun on a separate track north he's bouncing around with his friends his mouth stained blue from a lollipop locals are handing out to kids\nI mean they don't like to thank God\nShe says I'll cradle and for a while as we walk because he gets tired I don't care I'll carry him as far as we have to go\nThe caravan keep studying Justin safe gives them a sense of family they lost a few days ago it brings out locals with donations it's the only way\nShe could imagine making it to the U.S for NPR News I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nAre right now and update on the migrant children who are separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say over two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nThis thousands of angry young men last sidelined in the economy a marginal cost the thing is no point in going by the ... in the book they got no place in the system and no faith in his coat easy target the beginning brainwashed by these [noise]\nWho say this feeling innocent blood these planes in a good it's called sour times when I spoke to\nAsked him about that and how his feelings about it I've changed\nI didn't perform that for about four years because I was terrified that if anyone ever heard me say things like that I might get locked up I'm like get taught as a terrorism apologies as a radical\nAnd it's really interesting the the limitations of replacing ourselves and when I did fuss rapid to someone to my friend than you would like you know that's the usually pointing out\nI was really scared to say that to people so everything's in remind myself is never a good time if you wait until there's a perfect time is a perfect atmosphere to say something\nYou should just assume you're always going to piss someone else and then do anyway\n... that is thirty five he's British Pakistani Muslim a graduate of Oxford\nHe's also the first South Asian man to win an acting army for his role in the HBO drama the night of he

on his way drew people in with for some people would allow them to indulge their fantasies of a dangerous listening by ... them in the face with was the realization of our common humanity and I think that kind of bait and switch was actually ...\nI think you're right about this really eloquently and ... because at the time um you had this essay that appeared in the guardian which was the title was typecast uh as a terrorist and and you talk about this idea of there being three stages for brown actor in film do you mind just telling us what those three stages are\nBasically acting when his thoughts out you're also play the cab driver you also played terrorists is the arranged marriage is the on a kitty is that kind of thing I kinda just made a decision by this fall was him to do that look just wasn't interested in it that's the law went into this\nAnd sometimes I mean going without will typically when I joined industry which is Pete post nine eleven you know the U.S a kiss vibes and then the stage to off the stereotypical portrayal is I think his\nStories that take place on ... sized terrain by aims to ... those and that was one of the sides taking shape when I joined industry\nI was lucky that with a ... some of those projects to flat for lying it's about a group of terrorists but they just kind of these lovable dose the accident you blow up bin Laden wherever I'm just kind of makes you second guess maybe a more subversive than they once this is\nJust like us in stage three I'd do is um beside the of the problem is that you know where I'm not ... ...\nEuros I'm playing on only one which are very very culturally specific and you look at this is like playing roles where I can play a guy named a bull would they but the\nThe promised land in just about the rest of the nation is about getting to the place where it's like I could also be tactical and the fear is not about leaving my identity behind is about not just being shackled to a two dimensional idea of it\nSo as your star is on the rise you reach this new\nLevel of fame and we'll call this level of fame the Hollywood sex symbol\nOf what you can't see that the audience at this event can is a massive

especially when somebody is like a smart on current events and issues of the day then you are the kind of woke Internet boyfriends and that as a pedestal you can be knocked off of how precarious does it feel that kind of popularity\nOkay what is needed to do things I think about what you said first is this idea of kind of embracing sexuality is a man is a brown ... um that's something that sometimes I feel is like a little bit corny let's face it you know it can be but I also think if somebody is kind of important to do\nBecause I think often brown men you know culture in diaspora not allowed to be sexual sensitive sensual day like\nEither terrorists barbarians are going to come and eat your kids will be competing andme escalate and they don't object to design ...\nYou know I've internalize that die caught me as well\nAnd in my own mind I never costs myself is that the leading guy or someone who'd be you know desire but in that way and that's really a process of re education and kind of\nRe examining your self image to allow yourself to do that and now the cells to be that particularly if you're from a ... of culture so it's actually something that it's it's it's I think it's been Paul my junior year growth\nDue to allow myself to occupy that space\n[noise] um in terms of like being knocked off incident pedestals I mean like you happen to be ten seconds doesn't it you know\nAnd I asked because you do speak out on ideas right you're not afraid to go on some talk show and really say what you think about something and see if they get nervous yeah I guess maybe on some level I Do feel like\nI'm then maybe they want to know people like me doing\nThis so I Do feel some responsibility to represent wherever but coming we'd that in speaking to your point of being knocked off as kind of petty Susan disappointing people\nYou can't ever represent everyone you climb represent at one point of view the idea that I can like you know that any given film where there is like bending a ... disease so the big sequel goodness gracious me with a night of can satisfied experience of a billion Muslims around the world well how many million South Asians though in America that in

I'm just I Love old\nCan develop in such a way where their economic prosperity can be strengthened\nOkay so you say the number of concerns there or the U.S relationship with Mexico the very real migration concerns is there a concern for Mexico about its international image and all of this\nAbsolutely there's no doubt that since two thousand fourteen when Mexico started ... very high numbers of Central American ...\nIt's ... there's a double challenge one is domestically because a lot of people in Mexico believe Mexico is doing to us as quote unquote dirty work by stopping in deporting these individuals' back to their countries taking care of the problem for the U.S has a problem for us with very little returned from us for doing that\nAnd then the other challenges with international multinational organizations and NGOs that believe it or not I I agree with them in many ways that Mexico is not observing it since national politicians to provide individuals who have a bona fide reason to fear for their lives with a refugee or asylum hearing in Mexico\nWe see Mexican authorities deploying riot police but to the police don't seem to be using force they don't seem to be stopping these migrants in any way doesn't seem like Mexico is not making a real effort to stop the flow of these migrants into the U.S\nMexico was being doing humans work and supporting us since two thousand and fourteen but in this area what does that mean what does it mean to ... it means that does not fleeing because of persecution or fear for their lawyers most of them are being detained\nAnd deported and I think that Mexico using force\nTo shut down its border would play into the hands of those who are in this country or weaponized sing or seeking to weaponize immigration policy and who would use\nOnly deterrence to modify tries migration patents that have structural reasons and that will not be addressed by deterrence loan do\nYou get the sense that it should be the Mexican government's obligation or it should be their burden to process as many asylum seekers as possible within Mexico's borders rather than letting them continue their journey to the U.S\nThose who wish to stay in Mexico I mean we have a problem is the majority of the Central America and don't want to stay in ... migrants don't want to stay in Mexico Mexico is a\n... to the U.S Mexico border\nWith challenges when you are Mexican authorities tell them drawn apply for asylum in Mexico they say no we want to go to the United states so unless you have something akin to what the us has to be with Canada in terms of safe third country agreement it's very hard\nTo ensure that by processing them they can stay in Mexico instead of right doing the truck to us ... well I\nThink the incoming Mexican president ... Lopez Obrador how do you think he might approach the situation differently if these caravans do continue into the next Mexican administration\nHe just said that he will try and give these many of the Central American migrants a work visa to be able to stay and work in Mexico\nFor ... years of labor perhaps as as a source of jumper labor the problem here is that unless Mexico and also the United states devise a feasible temporary worker program that allows for the legal flow of temporary workers coming back and forth our borders\nThese issues will be stopgap measures\nFormer Mexican ambassador to the U.
