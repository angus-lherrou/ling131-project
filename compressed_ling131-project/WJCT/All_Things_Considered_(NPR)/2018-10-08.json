{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Steve Lopez is a columnist with the Los Angeles times who got to know Romero over the last Twenty years back in Nineteen Ninety eight his editors at the paper mentioned the thirtieth anniversary of the assassination of Robert Kennedy Lopez remembers they asked him one question\nDo you remember the photo up a bus boy\nIt was a comic photo that ran on the cover of life magazine and also around on the front page of the LA Times and a long time ago and I cut of course I remember the photo everybody remembers that as I was only a few years younger than ...\nWhen Bobby kennedy was assassinated and I remember looking up a teenager you know squandering Kennedy side to help them and I thought my goodness he's not much\nOlder than I Am so I set out to try to find one that I found them living in Santa and I took her story about one or Ninety eight\nSo take us back to June fifth Ninety sixty and remind us why one Romero was right next to Robert Kennedy when he was shot\nHe grew up in Mexico and my family moved to Los Angeles one one was about Warren recalled back from Mexico being an homes or there'd be two photos on the wall on a poke at one of JFK\nYou know as a teenager up moving to Los Angeles was really young to be a little hard but he did feel kind of marginalized a Mexican immigrant what do you remember of the counties when they spoke of Mexican people as hard working God her family oriented so we have to respect\nFor JFK and um he found out that Bobby kennedy was touring California the Democratic primary that you're running for president of the United states so I Want to do the job as a bus or the ... hotel and when he heard but Kennedy was a hotel and went to the other sports I mean he said I really want to meet this guy\nAnd if there's a call from Kennedy's room I'll do anything oh bus or train for a month I just want to be the sky so the call comes in and won\nWith another bus boy am I go up and he said the Kennedy was in the room to the door was in the room was on the phone and kind of a threat to the one thought well I get to see him but that's going to be about it and then it gets off the phone goes up look some coming on\nAnd on one so that was a hand to shake me remembers the blue eyes of Kennedy and he said it was the first time you felt like an American first time you call it like a man and he said he walked out of that route like ten feet tall over the next night Bobby kennedy win the primary he makes a speech\nAnd the Ambassador Hotel all the corn and when he was making an exit through the pantry area and one was on duty and wanted to push through the crowd Kennedy remembered him reach out and congratulated him so he grabbed him and here's a shock\nAnd next thing you know Kennedys flat on his back and won didn't know they were shot thought it was maybe somebody had choir crackers and it was Frank\nBut won ... who writes under running as her back over ... blood on him and then they realized it was on my goodness I'm Warren was carrying rose remain with somebody who says you have the miners are pulled them out and sort of shoved them into communities and and uh he was like in a way was rep Margolies\nScore so Robert Kennedy died um one Romero only Seventeen years old at the time incredible what happened to one Romero after that what kind of life did he live\nOne was haunted so much so\nBecause you have to get out of LA would come by bus or a new one out to see the bus or a bus or they wanted to have their photos taken with whom and got some letters I mean so most people are more contact with her more due to the good thing but he got so much of the stuff to help people fully you hadn't\nReached out to say 'cause he doesn't cause to shake your you know maybe you wouldn't have been shot and other people why couldn't you do something couldn't get get between Kennedy and the shooter and one is Seventeen year old equipment dealer according to the job we moved all the way to Wyoming\nAnd miss California came back but not LA worker northern California the San jose\nAnd eventually you know started his family and became a construction worker\nPaving and I think the one\nOne Carmen ... ripped a really difficult and I think he was always on the run you wanted to go\nOn her and remember the moment when he took to the Kennedy legacy of compassion and power and on about it looking back in the most horrible moment in his life and he didn't know how to express themselves\nAnd we kind of disappear and he doesn't talk to the media for yours you didn't do much of anything except work because\nIt was only in recent years that he began to he began to snap out of it a little bit he began to listen to people who are telling him you did nothing wrong\nOther relationship on Facebook with a woman from Germany who reached out to him when I wrote one of my columns and so you don't need to be so trouble you don't normally wrong and what I see that photo of news squatter communities I see somebody who was a brave young men who wanted to ask someone to lead\nWhile other people retreated and won began to see it that way and in his last year so I think\nThat a little bit of relief and it was still kind of a surfer and it was always looking for some ... some ... some explanation as to why he was in that moment on when the figure out what he needed to do with it\nYeah it is unexplainable as an as you said you'd catch up with one Romero from time to time and one time you went with him to Arlington National cemetery to visit Robert Kennedy's grave tell me about that what was it like\nWant to talk for years about wanting to pay his respects you wanted to go to one of these great when I was in Washington to the hotel where the night before he was going to go to ... it was a long time could buddy of hers are retired TV news guy by the memory go trick cone and we were talking\nAbout this visited one was going to want it to apologize talk like that for a long time and really going on and said you have nothing to apologize for\nMe and said I just I just want to call him up you know I miss him on the um I Wish I could have found a way to stop the board so the next morning we uh we go and wanted worrying who who's got the times square\nAnd we walk across some occurring won one at a moment to himself when he walked over on the ground you dropped this I mean wept and he later told me that we just talk to him and he was sorry and then they would never forget who wish to could have done more\nThan just incredible the stories some people live with their entire lives that was the LA Times reporter Steve Lopez remembering one Romero the busboy in Nineteen sixty eight photo of a dying Robert F Kennedy\nThe world comes

country of rallies\nLoving that men and loving eventually said that in Trump's take credit for winning the bitter fight over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court it's Monday October eighth and this is all things considered\nI notice that change is our we look at how fallout from Kavanaugh's confirmation could reshape the mid term election they take in the house has already bay but I really think the biggest impact is going to be felt in the Senate also secretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a trip to Asia\nThey talk to North Korea seemed promising that one time he stopped over in Beijing Chinese officials had tough words for the U.S\nAnd the pop star Taylor Swift led long silent on politics and he'll yesterday she changed course to indoors to Tennessee Democrats\nHonestly in an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore it that's really a surprise to me now the knees\nHow do you think their votes will shift their individual races going forward now\nI think in most cases the way that a lot of these moderate Democrats voted is going to make it harder\nFor Democrats efforts to take the majority the one vote that probably help to Democrats was when Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted for ... that probably help solidify his effort to get re elected\nBut Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota Claire McCaskill of Missouri those are two more moderate Democrats who voted against Kavanaugh you think that will hurt their chances come November\nYes I mean I think especially high kept in North Dakota was already probably trailing in her race she is not getting a very good reception at home about her vote against Kavanaugh so I think it makes it harder for her to get reelected\nIn Missouri Claire McCaskill talents on some\nVotes in rural areas to put her over the top I think that this vote against having all will cost her those rural votes\nLet's turn to the house now where Democrats would need to pick up twenty three feet to control the chamber suburban women were already expected to play a very large role in determining those contests but how do you think this fall out from Kavanaugh might amplify that\nI think a lot of the take in the house has already bake Republicans or help somewhat by new enthusiasm in their base a lot of the data we've seen shows that Democrats were very committed to this mid term almost at record levels so the question Democrats have is\nHow much more growth do they have and that vote what is their ceiling or had they hit it already huh so what they're more concerned about is how\nMuch this energizes the Republican vote\nI mean obviously the Supreme Court confirmation and is still raw in people's memories now a Kevin always just seated on the court this weekend more ceremonial leader today could only be overstating the influence of his confirmation this November because we're in this moment now\nAnd other issues like health care for instance could actually come to the forefront come November\nI Do not think we're overstating the empathic\nI'm not sure a lot of Democrats appreciate\nThe importance Republicans put on the Supreme Court I mean they view it as the last line of defense on a number of issues you know Democrats are artists are fired up I think that this has truly angered\nAnd frightened a lot of women on many levels so I think that women are ... gauge as they were ... they are just a lot angrier about it\n[noise] Jennifer Duffy is senior editor at the cook Political Report thank you very much thank you for having me\n\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo has been in Asia for the last few days he spent several hours and coming young with North Korea's leader Kim Jong un they talked about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and scheduling a second meeting with President Trump\nPompeo called it a good trip then he was in Beijing Today and that visit was notably not as good\nChinese foreign minister ... had some sharp words for ... about the state of U.S China relations\nNPR's Anthony Kuhn is in Beijing and he joins us now Hampton ... hey they're also so what exactly was set in front of reporters what were these remarks that were so critical of the U.S from China\nWill lung you really started out on a pretty harsh note saying that the U.S it constantly escalated trading tensions with China aided harm China's interest in regards to Taiwan and it it made a lot of baseless accusations against Chinas foreign and domestic policies\nWanting noted that compared come to brief him about his trip to North Korea and to seek China's cooperation and he said this is exactly why we should be cooperating and not confronting each other\nDid Pompeo respond to any of these criticisms in front of reporters\nWell he said to us and China were in fundamental disagreement on lungs points and I think what came out through this was that China feels that the U.S is just launching an all out sort of Cold War on every front\nAnd I think this has something to do with the speech that vice president Mike Pence gave last week\nWhere he accused China of malign effort to undermine President Trump in the upcoming elections\nYeah that was just one of the things I mean really it was across the board from stealing American intellectual property to human rights the\nTreatment of the week or a minority in she's young it was really confrontational and very little talk of cooperation\nWhy with Chinese officials take such a fence at Mike Pence's speech if the vast majority of what he was saying substantively is that the U.S has long been saying about China was it the particular tone Pence took or\nIs it the timing that right now you know ... trying to keep good relations with China when it comes to North Korea and this was just an inconvenience speech to be giving welcome Haywood making this trip\n[noise] you know this has been building up earlier this year we had a national security strategy an official document which basically means China as one of the main threats\nFacing the U.S so that's part of the attitude you know I I think it's really just China feels that this marks a shift away from cooperation and towards confrontation this this depiction of China is really a rogue regime in one of the top threats to us security that it has to be dealt with harshly\nI really think that's the tone that China's reacting to and I think it will be reacting to it I think that's going to be sinking in for quite a while\nNow under previous administrations officials have been reluctant to push Beijing too hard on on trade or or other issues the U.S has been critical of when it comes to China\nOr because of this idea that it needs China's help when it comes to North Korea so could President Trump's tough stance with China hurt the U.S his ability to reach a deal with North Korea\nAre well certainly that's the implication of what happened today of course we're seeing a confluence of factors is not just the north Korea issue\nThat the U.S needs China's help on it's it's just so many issues of global importance but to us seems to want to put a competition with China in front of cooperation on these global issues\nAll right That's NPR's Anthony Kuhn thank you very much Anthony You're welcome and also [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to all

Bush advisor Karl Rove but\nBe harder now it is possible to\nRight which is another way of saying working across party lines and finding allies on particular issues but we're talking about climate today that is much different than the climate that we did Twenty years ago\nAnd so I'm a Critz word it it would be you know one of the country would not find\nSome supporters of the president's paint a different picture if the Republicans lose the house they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did with Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever shows that we fired because clearly it no understanding of how politics works I think this president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans had been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallo says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do\nReal success she's going to bomb of people would have to like when they were sixty three it's a gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\nTalk rules his party by fear begin to see them a lot less if they get their books he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of been a steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nKeep you posted to please get real dangerous to them you\nCan join what\n\nI was nine years old when I first got the talk\nGeorge I know you base the scene on talks you yourself got growing up what is it like to film a scene that fictional but that represent something completely real to most of the black community\nUm you know it was a very emotional scene I remember um Russell Hornsby plays math Carter would choke up because he has kids himself\nI have a Fifteen year old son so it was a very emotional time because in the African American community\nThat is something that everyone should have been through a one way or another for me it was with my uncles and my dad you know they came out of their male K rights you know in sixty eight with family members in Detroit Milwaukee, Wisconsin so all those things were planted aside me\nSo in the movie you know do is to young kids who actually hearing the same for the first time it was just the most ... is deals with history is deal with survival and how we can continue to stay on this earth without police brutality or being shot or being killed you know this part of the the fear of African American community\nOne of the most fascinating storylines for me is how star feels like she has to be two different people all the time and she thinks part of that means literally ... doing her blackness while she's walking around her mostly white high school William ...\nSlang makes them the cool thing makes me put those kids\nBasically Williams a star doesn't get any one of the reasons that color get\nAnd I hate myself for doing it\nAngie I read that part of the inspiration for stars double life came from your own life because you also lived in a mostly black neighborhood while attending a mostly white private Christian college in Mississippi what was that like feeling like you had to be two different people all the time\nIt was a struggle um I did I Lived in a mostly black poor neighborhood in Jackson, Mississippi and I went to a mostly white upper class private school just ten minutes away from my home but\nIn ten minutes it was like going into an entirely different world so I over compensated by doing what's called ... um I Would make myself more presentable I thought I'm\nI was careful of ally spoke I was careful of how much emotion I showed 'em and it was a struggle because so often I was silent on things that matter to me um and I would experience a micro aggressions from my classmates and I was silent about him I never called up the racism like what\nWell one time one of my professors had a party at his house for Christmas and he had a huge Christmas tree with a big pile of gifts underneath\nAnd we could all pick a gift and it was like get gifts like we'll be cushions and all of this other stuff is just trying to get rid of\nAnd when it was my turn I pick the gifts and there was a prescription drug book inside and a toy water good\nAnd one of my classmates goes oh my God the black girl from the ghetto got the drug book and the gun how funny wow and because some of my classmates were laughing and I just made myself laugh because I thought I had to\nUm and that was one of those moments where I was so angry at myself for not speaking up and honestly that was a defining moment for me because I had to realize that I was worth speaking up for if nothing else and that they needed to know that even a joke like that is not okay so for me that was the moment I said you know what I Am not going to be silent again\nYeah one thing that was so fascinated with this movie doesn't only look at the disconnect between black and white it also touches upon where the black community can disagree like when stars uncle Carlos who's a cop straight up tell star how he would react to a black suspect\nA lot goes to a cop smile when they pull someone over hiding something costs though but you still don't know if they did anything wrong that's why we searched but if they open the door or reached through an open window\nI'll be going for Web so if I think I see a gun I don't hesitate ...\nIt was so interesting to hear a black man own that in this movie because it shows that you know this isn't just white against black racism it's much more complicated right you're ... you're saying George that it's not just white people that are to blame for the racial bias we've seen policing\nYes definitely use 'em that scene was a very important moment in the book\nAnd I really wanted to show off the side you know to is this the idea of how the system you know uh for police officers and how that goes all the way back to the idea of the slave patrols with free slaves and that's a system\nThat is taught and sometimes that system can be taught with African Americans as well so you have that version and then also you have another layer on top of that is that sometimes as African Americans we have racism and buys them inside ourselves and how we see other African Americans as well\nAnd she you told this story through the eyes of the sixteen year old ... do you think audiences are more capable of empathy when they're watching a kid rather than an adult for Apple with this kind of trauma receiving is kind of trauma\nUnfortunately yeah yeah\nYeah when I first decided to write it I'm I'm a huge young adult fiction saying anyway and I always knew I wanted to write young adult fiction\nUm but it was a definitely a decision early on to write this from the perspective of a sixteen year old girl for several reasons I'm the first reason for me was because they'll often victims in these cases are teenagers or young people\nAnd Trayvon Martin was Seventeen Tamir Rice was twelve\nAnd I think about those kids who look at them and see themselves and I wanted to talk to them first and foremost\nUm but I also knew that when adults take this book that they would be more likely to empathize with a sixteen year old girl than a thirty year old woman\nUm for some audience is there something about getting it from the perspective of someone who has so much innocent who has so little experience you've literally written this girl become a woman you see her forced into adulthood because of her trauma\nAnd I think there's something about that at least for adults there something about seeing a child go do this\nAnd my hope was that people will look at real life sixteen year old in these cases and actually see them as children and not as adults\nWriter Angie Thomas and director of Georgetown and their new movie it's called the hate you get\nThank you both very much it was a real pleasure to talk to you guys came out\nThere listening

Chang we're going to take you back now to the late Eighteen hundreds when eating food in the U.S ... taking a calculated risk\nThe country was growing people were moving into cities and industrialized nation Gaye food producers new sometimes dangerous ways to stretch their products they were very inventive\nWith fake re back then because there were no rules against it right it's completely legal to do whatever\nThat's author Deborah Blum her new book explores that era before the U.S enacted food safety rules my co host Ari Shapiro talk with her about it\nThe book is called the poisons squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century I started by asking Deborah Blum what someone living around Nineteen hundred might find in everyday foods like coffee candy or milk\nMilk was a a great example of just how bad things could get for a number of reasons one daring men seeking to sort of stretch their profits would Senate with water it wasn't always clean water at one point there was actually a case in Indiana which it was pond water pond water\nPond water and and and it was a notice when the family found worms wiggling and the bomb\nAnd pond water was actually some of the safer stuff the milk was contaminated with\nThat's exactly right because once you would then the milk you add to reconstituted in all kinds of weird way and say what shocked us than a ...\n... we're a coal tar dies and sometimes toxic dies like yellow lab to kinda make it more gold and again instead of kind of grayish are bluish and then\nBecause it was prone to rot this was before ... and before refrigeration they would dump preservatives in it and the most popular one was formaldehyde which is an embalming compound\nWhich is not good for humans to ingest\nNo and so you actually go out and can see in newspaper headlines around the country during this period was embalmed milk scandals\nSo along comes to protecting us your story Dr Harvey Washington wildly and his title is chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture why did he care so much about this issue [noise]\nAlways thought of them is kind of all how holy roller cameras right you of Harvey Washington while he was the son of tennis\nPreacher and farmer in Indiana he was\nFather was a conductor on the underground railroad he was really raise I mean there's a real Mitt nineteenth century kind of child and he was really raised to think of what he did needing to be a higher calling and he would describe chemistry that way chemistry in the service of good\nAnd so when he became the chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture I mean this is at a period where there is no FDA there is no consumer protection agency this tiny group of chemists that he commanded at the department of agriculture was it an food safety he took up that\nCause and your book is titled the poison squad comes from project to tamper took it really shows his commitment to this uh describe it the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruits other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days a week super fancy meals that are cooked by professional show of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that content suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you were testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea\nI'll just tested on people and so he did\nTo no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been\nOrganizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and as they catch the national attention which they did they were front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "08"}
