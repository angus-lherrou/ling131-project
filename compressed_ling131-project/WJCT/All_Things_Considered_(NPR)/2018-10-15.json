this hearing how did that play out did this plea deal comes the surprise\nYou know I Can't really say it's a surprise ever since he was indicted in June it seemed as if things were moving in the direction of a plea deal\nProsecutors had copies of his electronic messages with reporters taxed encrypted messaging apps and that made it a hard case to defend now Wolfe was charged this year with three felony counts of lying\nBut in this plea deal he'll only plead guilty to one which means he likely faces zero to six months in prison and the judge ... brown Jackson let him go home today\nAs

on and so forth and the fact that it might have been commercialized monetize that's deeply upsetting\nCompanies are exploiting medical data to develop new drugs devices and algorithms to help diagnose

Daniel says state laws are clear on one point to the\nHealth care provider own state\nFederal law which she helped write way back in Nineteen Ninety six so is it the health care providers can't sell the data but from there the rules get blurry Daniel says for example the doctor can use it for research or to improve health care operations\nIf he's trying to use your information and arts develop a product that he can then sell and make millions of dollars off of that might not be a health care operation but there isn't a clear interpretation at this place\nAnd there's growing concern about issues of privacy and ownership middle income coke or chief officer at the drug companies ... says it's already difficult to track the mini murky transaction having to do with people's personal medical data\nSometimes it just feels as though it's blood diamonds in the world of data sharing my retirement really tried how that data ... through but someone's making money off this and making an incredible amount of money up this especially I think they're all going to be regulations as we start waking up to the ...\nHe says companies like his seeing big changes ahead would be willing to pay something for data if that gave them clear rules about how they could use it and there are no company springing up to explore this idea well which came coke or advises is called humanity dark coat\nCEO Richard ... says is long term goal was to make medical data a person legal property to get away from the current system\nThat data is being used without being classified as property and without explicit consent democratization and as a result there's this whole gray area about can you really make billions of dollars from a discovery that came from me\nBefore his company has just rolled out an act that would let people specify how their medical data can and cannot use people still won't owned their data but they can agree to do business with companies who are more explicit agreement about how it can be used companies could potentially pay each user ten dollars a month for access to their data tours as\nHumanity dot code is framing it's for profit business as a fight for a new human right Michel ... is a company president\nThe data absolutely has a fair value has a real market value it's sixty billion dollar business right now just a medical data so why should we not have some component of that\nAnd they say they're taking one step building a technical framework to make these transactions possible Richard Harris NPR News\nWe're going to hear more from lawyer Jody Daniel she's going to talk with us about what we as consumers can do with our health data welcome to the program it's great to be here\nI Want to broaden the discussion out because Richards reporting focused on patient records but there are other ways that are health data can be collected by private companies especially now that they're smart watches and fitness trackers and things like that so um what are the rules around what can be collected and how it can\nBe used right now there are no federal rules governing the use of health data disinformation apart from what they say in their privacy policy\nIs basically the wild west any only limitation on what they can do with that data is what they stay in their privacy policies and you and I know that most people don't read the privacy policy is because they're very hard to read a hard to understand it very complicated\nAnd we just want to use the tool that can help us in managing our health care\nThis feels crazy to me because when it comes to the smart watch business which is only growing if you look at a company like apple they're kind of doubling down on this technology is it because we are basically by agreeing to use the product heading this stuff over to them like\nAnd the rules are different for them the rules were designed when all of the health data was in the doctor's office and the hospital and in the health plan and said the rules apply to those entities\nBut yes when we sign up for a smart devices smart watch a health that\nWe're basically giving them permission these companies permission to use our data\nHowever they see fit and they usually outlined on their privacy policy which could also mean they could sell it that's correct if a company gets access to information because you give it to them they may be able to sell it and it might be perfectly legal unless they specifically say they won't do they sell it\nIs there a market right now for in people's data about their blood sugar or whatever\nYeah health information is incredibly valuable and a lot of companies that collect vast amounts of health information from individuals are selling at least aggregate or do you identify data\nTo pharmaceutical companies that are trying to understand how their medication might work or what might be an opportunity for them to help improve diagnosis or treatment\nOf him he said he identifies I mean you're a data point in a large spreadsheets\nYou can be a data point at large spreadsheet but there isn't necessarily any prohibition on them selling identifiable data and say you really have to be careful and make sure that\nThey said that they will not use your identifiable data in ways that you don't want like\nFor sale is there a movement to give us more control over our health data or privacy protections or something\nWe are seeing a lot of conversations in Congress and we are seeing some changes at the state level for example the state of California has recently passed\nVery privacy protective law regarding data generally but they've carved out health information that's protected under federal law or under California state law says he's added privacy protections actually don't apply to the health data that\nAlready a subject to a mix of the law\nWhich is kind of a big deal given that it's home to Silicon Valley [laughter] very interesting yeah

was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary\nBen Sasse Republican senator from Nebraska doesn't except that it's divisive and it was a mistake ... as a member of the Judiciary Committee and frequent Trump credit\nIn fact on the Senate for the day after that rally ... took issue with the president's behavior while explaining his own concerns about the debate over the nominee I spoke with Ben Sasse earlier today about political divisiveness it's the subject of his new book them we started with what happened with the Kavanaugh hearings and his take on the me too movement\nThe me too movement is a very important movement it's messy and it's complicated and there are places where it's going to overreach and we haven't fought throughout a process all of the due process issues but fundamentally I think we have a culture of sexual assault in this country for decades we don't have a shared sexual aspect\nAnd the me too movement is very very important and we need to handle it with a lot more delicacy than something you can handle well at a campaign rally so that was an unfortunate move\nBut what's your response to many conservative and Republican women out there who have talked about this idea of him to movement that they're worried about their sons that\nThey've kind of move from one part of the conversation to apart that says men are at a disadvantage here that there are radical feminist women who are coming after men in your life with false allegations [noise]\nWell I mean it's clearly the case that we need to figure out how in an American tradition that's always had writes for the accused as well how we navigate things that are regularly going to be tried in the media\nSo I I think that that is a false choice to divide the world into whether or not we want to love and protect our sons and whether or not we want to protect and trust our daughters\nUm this is a cultural movement and moments that is much bigger than politics the me too movement doesn't belong to Republicans or the Democrats the me too movement belongs to women\nWho are having the courage to come forward and say this is wrong people should be protected we want that for all of our daughters and all of our sisters um we also want there to be writes for the accused and right now we haven't yet navigated to a place that will hopefully be a lot healthier than where we are now\nIn the meantime we've heard Mitch McConnell another is called me to activists and angry mob is that what you see is that what you saw in the hallway and that is that how you feel about that activism [noise]\nI didn't hear a leader McConnell comments about the me too movement as a mob I heard leader McConnell speaking to the fact that there are a politicians in American Life today\nWho are saying to people if you'd differ on a policy issues should be hounded out of a restaurant that's actually happening right now where your politicians going to cameras saying don't let people eat dinner with their kids that's wrong\nI'm Dr Ford's family and Brett Kavanaugh's family both suffered repeated death threats over the course of the one month circus that the Senate conducted I'm a politician who has to for a time of serve in public life and I get death threats and it is what it is because you put yourself out there in the public square\nBut if you're going to serve on the judiciary or if you're going to raise allegations about sexual violence in the past the fact that we don't just have those people suffering death threats having to move out of their homes\nOn but we also have other politicians calling on people who you might differ with on policy to be handed out of restaurants that is all black behavior\nWhat is your response to the activists who says if you are paid by me the taxpayer and I see you in public it's perfectly fine for me to tell you what I think and it's perfectly fine for you to be held accountable for policies that are harmful\n... this is why I wrote them most fundamentally because political tribalism is ramping in our time\nThere are all sorts of important debates that need to be had inside politics but the idea that politics should swallowed whole public square\nThe idea that there is no civil society that there are no cultural debates that there are no economic debates there are no religious institutions are there are no recreational places where our kids play wrecked sports and youth league that will not sustain a republic\nThat's Nebraska
