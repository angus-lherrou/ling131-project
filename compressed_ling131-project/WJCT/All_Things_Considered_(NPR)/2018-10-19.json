Hillary Clinton reopened a can of worms this week during an interview on CBS Sunday Morning she was answering this question about her husband\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now\nBecause she said Lewinsky a twenty two year old intern at the time was an adult that echoed the position that Bill Clinton took earlier this year when he was asked about the affair on the today show\nThis was really good at Twenty years ago two thirds of the American people sided with me\nThat is true two thirds of Americans at the time said Clinton should not be removed from office that the charges didn't justify it well what the country feel the same way today and how does Bill Clinton sex scandal of two decades ago continue to shape political\nCulture today Susan Glasser oversaw the Washington Post's coverage of Bill Clinton's impeachment and now she writes the letter from Washington column for the New Yorkers Susan Glasser thanks for coming in thank you so much you started at the post one week before the Lewinsky story broke\nOne week before the Lewinsky story invoke exactly I was supposed to be the deputy national editor in charge of investigation so at the time that was the Clinton fundraising scandal now mostly forgotten in the annals of history\nAnd when the Lewinsky story broke how did you all initially think about framing it well what kind of story was\nWell it was a political earthquake and I remember standing slap Todd in the post newsroom along with you know hundreds of other journalists when President Clinton came out and said you know I did not have\nSexual relation with that woman and in hindsight it seems more clear cut what the outcome was going to be but there were certainly moments when we felt along the way that the Clinton presidency with hanging in the balance\n[noise] I've been going back through some of the Post's coverage of the times and trying to reconcile what you were writing with what I remember feeling I'm Around the same age as Monica Lewinsky and I'm struck when I look back at how women of my generation didn't rally around her\nThe culture has shifted and you know as a woman in many ways I'm sure you know you and I both\nWelcome many of the changes and the revelations have the last year about sexual exploitation of women harassment of women in the workplace and this unfortunately was not reflected in either the politics or the culture of that moment it was at a sexist\nEnvironment in Washington in some ways that are still true today and some ways that thank goodness are or not\nTo feel really of a different time we look back at it now setting aside things the Clintons have said in this last year it was really Donald Trump who played a big role in re injecting the Clintons sex scandals in to the national political debate at the second presidential debate he brought Clinton's accusers\nActions speak louder than\nMr Trump may have said that\nJuanita Broderick speaking right before walking into that presidential debate to sit in the audience with Paula Jones and other Clinton accusers\nSusan Glasser the read on that was Trump was wheeling out Clinton's accusers in order to deflect from the Access Hollywood tape in order to deflect attention from his own accusers did it work\nWell I think Trump has learned a lot from how Bill Clinton survived the impeachment scandal and raising it out\nAnd denying or telling the truth slowly you know Trump did use the female accusers of Bill Clinton to shield himself I get that he knew correctly that Democrats would be accused of being hypocrites that has continued to be the case throughout the subsequent me to\nRevelations which took place after that twenty sixteen campaign and many people myself included believe that part of that sort of national furor over the me two story has been a response in some ways to the fact that there is another male president in the oval office who has been credibly\nAccused of misconduct by numerous women in my case I Believe that Nineteen when\nDo you think Bill Clinton would have survived the Lewinsky scandal if it unfolded today you know that is the question I Will say that the Democratic party has shifted publicly at least more than the Republican Party when it comes to what to do about\nMembers in their own ranks who are accused of this kind of wrongdoing look at how quickly they abandon Al Franken the Democratic senator from Minnesota you know maybe that would have happened with Bill Clinton maybe not\n[noise] do you think it serves a purpose to reckon with Bill Clinton's legacy at this point where does that leave us or is it time to let it go well\nI Do think Donald Trump's continued mentioning of the Clinton at every turn suggests how useful part is in\nFoil it is at this hyper partisan time you know there's some truth to Bill Clinton's point that we have litigated this issue two decades ago and to me the fact that it does keep occurring is largely a reflection of the fact that we are grappling with the country with the unique\nPresidents have Donald Trump and the many

Will Stone who covers health care there Well hi Elsa so you know we see a lot of issue ads about health care throughout the state including one that ... gene started\nBut what candidates actually saying about health care on the campaign trail Democrats\nAre certainly framing it as a choice between two very different visions of health care and another referendum on the Affordable CARE Act\nThat voters can expect a GOP to do what they tried to do last year or repeal the healthcare law I'm In this narrative is kind of forcing Republicans to take what I call more defensive posture\nUh it's very much on display in our tight Senate race between Democrats have been the defense of ones for the past eight years but you think it's Republicans now that is seems to be what's happening right now I mean if you just look at the race between Democrat cures didn't cinema\nUm she's using that line of attack against her Republican opponent Martha mix Sally and you know in response to mix families how to kind of soften moderate her stance on the issue saying we cannot go back to where we were before the CIA that we need to fix the law and protect people with preexisting conditions\nAnd so for me I think it shows the to win a statewide race in Arizona\nWhich before the AC I had one of the highest rates in the country Republicans like make Sally need to reassure voters\nThat they support certain key provisions of the healthcare law and not just a full repeal so you don't get the sense that the mantra repeal and replace resonates anymore in the states not so much and you can see that you know in the political races and a lot of the concern revolves around Medicaid\nArizona expanded Medicaid under the AC a and we had a lot of people who needed coverage so there was a big rush to joined the program\nThat was at risk under the GOP bill and people in Arizona like the state's Medicaid program a Republican moderates like the program at functions well\nSo no one wanted to see that a damaged or cuts\nAnd as for those who shop for insurance plans on the marketplace they say they want more options cheaper plans lord a duck to bowls but they do not want to see a full overhaul\nYeah I I'm more options you know we heard current body said that she was hoping to have more choices in terms of health insurance during the next open enrollment season that starts next month what does it look like I mean is it looked like there will be more options for the state\nIt's looking remarkably better of the market has stabilized at its rebounded health experts I talked to said will be more options and it's really one of the more resilient are examples in the country of the marketplace that's working that kj these Will Stone thank you very much well thank you [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\nI'm ... and ... ... ...\n... ...\nYou're listening to all things considered this afternoon on eighty nine nine W.
