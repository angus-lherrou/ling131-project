station\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I noticed that Chang mid term elections are less than one week away and we're going to take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races\nBillions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign money projects at a total of five point two billion dollars will be spent during this entire election cycle\nThe group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all of that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay so five point two\nBillion how some compare\nTo previous mid term election spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight billion in two thousand fourteen that's a thirty five percent jump and a record\nAnd how is this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now TV\nIs still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back where we see that a almost a billion dollars has been spent already this cycle on media\nWay uh uh from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media advertising on TV for the competitive races a digital advertising\nAll races yeah especially on Facebook\nYeah here it through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think\nWell it was certainly successful in the two thousand sixteen or election cycle for a lot of actors are so far I think as of today face because now to a two hundred Ninety six million dollars\nAnd uh as in terms of FCC report it digital ad spending a it's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd as we said the vast bulk of the spending is coming out of democratic candidates and you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is\nThat a sign that that site has a good shot at winning or is it more of a sign of some insecurities and lack of confidence\nI think both come into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see\nBig numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out on both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters\nIn other states that is not so helpful and election day so a there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling ah by voters and other states that have nothing to do with the interests of the district or the state\nIt represents people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it really counts\nSo that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that ... de Presse voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially tiresome for the voters\nSo more money does not necessarily mean more votes\nMore money does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether a the Democratic a fundraising advantage\nWill help to drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change especially in the house races Sheila Krumholz\nIs the executive director of the center for Responsive Politics thanks very much my pleasure thank you\nThe U.S has had three alarming incidents in a matter of days the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh another at a supermarket in Louisville, Kentucky and\nThe bomb scare suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats these raise the question are we entering a period of increased political violence in the country NPR's Tim Mak has our story\nLast year after a shooter opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a baseball practice outside Washington a CBS News poll found that Seventy three percent of Americans felt the tone of the political debate encourages violence\nCarolyn Luke and fire is the head of the national Institute for civil discourse formed after a nun other shooting injured congresswoman Gabby Giffords in twenty eleven the incident killed six and wounded Thirteen\nI have to say to him I've been surprised at the number of times where we're in we're holding a discussion were holding a conversation across differences\nAnd someone will actually say that they believe we could come to a civil war again in the United states but then she said many people back off from their initial conclusions they do say no I don't I don't really believe that will have a civil war but I find some of what I see happening\nAnd I don't know if Republicans don't show up to the ... I don't know Democrats are going to show the whole but I Will tell you the sons and daughters that we\nHis leadership like this that has barber being compared to Martin Luther king junior this year he

yet he actually themselves out there that a dancer preaches for hours on end and and they put in all fairness uncomfortable playing and and car seats just to be able to keep on spending the gospel\nBarbers determination to keep going in spite of his disability and who's growing national importance earned him a coveted MacArthur genius award this month\nThat label genius would boost the ego of many people but Barbara says his disability keeps him in his place there was a time\nThat they thought I'd never be able to walk again without a walk or being in a wheelchair so every day is a day a brace on opening day\nBut they think it's going to be more about immigration and dysfunction\nAnd they said if they make it about sanctuary cities and abolishing ice\nThey think that's good for them and it's a message that they've been pushing all along is not something that just popped up now on dysfunction the concede that people say they want a check and balance but they are trying to argue is the check and balance you want that when it comes to Democrats\nOf course President Trump is not on the ballot but he is on the campaign trail and on a lot of people's minds does he seemed to be a plus or minus for the midterm elections for Republicans right now\nOn depends on which election you're talking about right in the Senate probably he is because the landscape and the Senate just favors Republicans so strongly you know in places like Indiana West Virginia Tennessee in Texas where\nRepublicans really should do well and they need that base to come out but in places like Arizona and Nevada it's not really clear that he is and you know ... and Democrats really need their base out there and they're happy\nTo let President Trump's talk and what they think is suppress vote a among some of his base but also hurt\nWith independence um you know but the fact that Republicans are in a vice overall even in the house they need Trump's base but he turns of independence and women in the suburbs and that really hurts them a down ballot in those key key house races\nI also want to ask you about young voters because traditional leaves her mid term voter has been a little bit older than the voter and a presidential year but this year we saw huge youth marches against gun violence or do you think that we're going to see a different kind of turn out\nNext week well look we're expecting to see a record turnout you know something that could be as the highest turn out in the last fifty years or so so that\nCould really fundamentally reshaped what we're talking about here at the same time younger voters are still lagging behind some of those other groups older white voters in particular who still say that they're fired up that they want to go vote\n'em you know they don't traditionally turn out in big numbers in mid terms you know what kind what kind of effect of this discussion of civility have on them I mean on the one hand\nMany young voters in particular disaffected with politics but UC millennials kind of take matters into their own hands with like online fundraising for causes that are important to them on the other we saw you know young voters

elections are less than one week away and we can take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races\nBillions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign many projects that a total of high point two billion dollars will be spent during the entire election cycle\nThe group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all of that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay some five point two\nBillion how some compare\nTo previous midterm election spending\nIs way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle\nOr says just three point eight billion in two thousand fourteen that's at thirty five percent jump and a record\nAnd how is this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now\nTV is still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back we see that a almost a billion dollars has been sent already this cycle on media\nWay up from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media uh advertising on TV for the competitive races\nA digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook yeah here it through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think well it was certainly successful in the two thousand sixteen or election cycle for a lot of victors\nAre so far I think as of today face because now to a two hundred Ninety six million dollars\nAnd uh as in terms of FCC report it digital ad spending a it's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd he said the vast bulk of all the spending is by Democrats right right you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is\nThat a sign that that side has a good shot at winning or is it more of a sign of some insecurity and lack of confidence\nI think both come into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see\nBig numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out on both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters\nIn other states that is not so helpful and election day so there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling a by voters and other states that have nothing to do with the interests of the district or the state\nIt represents people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it\nReally counts so that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that ... de Presse voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially tiresome for the voters\nSo more money does not necessarily mean more votes more\nMoney does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether a the Democratic a fundraising advantage\nWill help to drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change
