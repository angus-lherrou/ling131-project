I never say that a President Trump and those around him created this they didn't\nBut they they lit a fire uncertain\nSo walk me through the range of incidents that you have seen emerge over the last several years well during the presidential campaign the number of reporters who\nPosted slightly critical things of a Donald Trump or even a millennia Trump we're bombarded with anti Semitic comments on a Twitter\nFacebook Instagram et cetera et cetera so online harassment online harassment but now we're seeing that uh the online harassment\nCan move further over to real danger and\nThat's I think has left even people who have been somewhat are worried about this feeling much much more concerned about\nAnti Semitism also appears to be on the rise in in other countries it if you look at a incidents being reported in the u._k. and ... for example which has nothing to do with the political right here in the U.S [noise]\nUm well I think what we're seeing a certainly in certain countries we see it in Hungary we see it to a certain degree in Poland we've seen that with the AFC the alternative for Deitch land party in Germany and Austria\nIs a certain populism anti democratic liberal democratic as as one leader called it\nPopulism a witch playing paints Jews in traditional anti Semitic stereotypes they control the media they control the finances they are far into our country a etc [noise]\nSome\nJewish families are drawing parallels in light of this past weekend events parallels to Germany in the Nineteen thirties and I want to put that to you for some historical perspective on this I mentioned you're a professor of Holocaust studies do you see parallels or are we nowhere near that point yeah\nUm I see certain parallel and I see certain ways in which the analogy does not apply at all\nIn Nazi Germany this was the government is doing this uh what was seen in this country in terms of anti Semitism is may be a willingness some part of ... certain segments of the government and certain people in government\nTo look the other way but this is not government sponsored however there are parallels a their parallels in the attacks on democratic institutions are institutions which are at the bedrock of our\nDemocracy the judiciary are elected members of Congress you can disagree with them but when you begin to engage an ad hominem attacks attacks on the media\nPeople respond to that especially your followers who are looking for an easy explanation and and that I find very disturbing and there there is a parallel [noise]\nIf you see parallels to you also see lessons ways for civilization to advance and and do things in a very different way than the way they are holding the twentieth century\nI think so I think first of all not to see it just on one side what we're talking about today is anti Semitism coming from the right but there certainly is anti Semitism on the left number to not to tolerate\nAnti Semitic comments you know Thanksgiving is coming up and we all have a crutch an uncle who may make some comments and people around the table you know sales and Sancho John and they let it pass we can't do that we may not get you know uncle

considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro we're learning more today about the man who's believed to have killed eleven worshippers at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday he was arraigned in a courtroom in Pittsburgh earlier today\nJulie turkey which has been reporting on his background for the New York times and she joins us now welcome thank you thank you for having me you've been speaking with people who know Robert powers including a childhood friend of his what have you learned from them\nSo most of the people that we've spoken to describe him as very quiet very isolated lived alone he seemed to watch television in the night he PO box for not the sort of a mailbox that his apartment which is just south synagogue\nBut I spoke to a friend of his red known him for years and years they went to elementary school together they went to middle school together they went to high school together and he said that that I'm Robert ... as a child was very smart but also seemed to really struggle\nWith social cues and the two of them were friends in the way to play together they were built things together that we take things apart [noise]\nAh they would build bombs together as sort of pranks and blow up watermelons but as time went on the two of them sort of grew apart\nRobert hours became quieter more isolated\nAnd then in high school eventually just here and it's not clear if she graduated and it's not clear to the man what happened after\nThat paint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a ghost like he's not even there\nYeah um so he lived in is sort of low slung apartment building about twenty five minutes south of the synagogue and the people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember the name\nAnd that he was pretty much goes he would come and go\nAnd sometimes disappear for days come back\nGo inside and that was pretty much ...\nAnd there's such a contrast between vet demeanor in person and who he was on line tells about the person he was on social media\nSo at least in the last year he spent a lot of time on the Internet and he\nUsed a lot of really terrible things about Jews about immigrants he was clearly very angry and he seemed to find a like mine get community on gas which is usually the network that has become more popular\nAmong All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are on ... in places like Twitter\nBook even the president didn't escape his\nAnd he seemed to think that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals that Mr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed Hughes hateful views or whether she just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\nI don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple of weeks and then a couple of months as investigators going into his past\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about him and his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about\nHow did she become as hateful as he did and our man that's been going on and what role did commit plane\nDid the current sort of political anger and conflict plane uh so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer files are going to be going to his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nKind of thing but Julie ... with the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers v accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow\nAt today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that the president\nI'd been wanting to write this now for quite a long time but I couldn't figure out how to do it I just couldn't get it right and then suddenly I had to a realization so the first one was it all takes place in the marriage shelters office that's what the story is in the second was it's from the marriage ... point of view\nAnd that was a big step for me for two reasons you know I I've never been a marriage counselor\nAnd number two the marriage culture had to be a woman why I just that I've asked myself that I mean part of it was that my marriage culture was a woman\nAnd I believe most marriage cancers are women and it just felt right it just felt like it had to be that way how similar is a marriage counselor and I spoke to the one that you used [noise]\nSo the marriage culture in the book is different but the themes of the marriage counts or the technique to the marriage counselor are very much the same way explain what do you mean one of those themes and techniques\nSo for example the marriage counselor says there are no deals you know you can't make any deals with each other we're not going to do exchanges of promises\nWere not going to say okay I'll do this and you'll do that and therefore marriage is all going to work out there is none of that you know to go to a marriage culture who says that to you is really an interesting experience\nAnd then the second thing is if you want something from your partner you've got to make them want to give it to you so in the simplest situation if you want your partner to love you then you've got to become to kind of person that your partner's going to want to love ... you know\nThose are the kinds of insight simple but I think critically important insights that my real marriage counselor and my six year old marriage counselor share [noise] would you mind reading a section of the book for me no sure page thirty eight [noise]\nUsually Sandy didn't pay much attention to the world beyond her small office the illicit meeting in New York where aggression was going for the weekend what bill's wife knew everything that happened outside the office she didn't care\nTo Sandy the important story was what happened inside or office it was what she had to focus on it was the story it was what was really happening\nOf course all the time it was tempting to get caught up in the outside story the affairs the sex the trails the soap opera but the real work was here inside or office\nIt almost feels like a FISA statement for the book it is actually and I put that in because I didn't quite trust the reader to get it ... you know those two paragraphs or a marker for the reader saying look guys this is where the real story is\nI Know that's true of the novel is that really true in life it's hard to imagine that the trails and affairs cannot actually be what's important to whether American lives or dies\n[noise] I have to say that in the long run they don't matter the stuff that happens outside the office doesn't matter and and I can tell you that by analogy\nSo what happens in really good marriage counseling the marriage counseling illustrated in this book is that by the end of the process when you really begin to get it when\nYou can actually understand for the first time in your life or your partner is really saying to you you feel like a new person\nIs if you shed everything that happened before right I mean so if you had an affair before it's as if it happened to a different person that doesn't count anymore you're you're new does that make any sense\nIt doesn't it makes it sound like the marriage counseling is about much more than marriage about real transformation of each individual\nIt has to be it absolutely has to be and that's why it takes time because it's\nIt is not some kind of blinding insight that you're going to have oh God this happened to me and I was fourteen now we understand it I'll be different it's not about that at all it's about learning lessons that you should have learned when you were growing up maybe by watching your parents but your parents didn't have it together they weren't didn't have a great marriage\nIt's about learning these lessons of how\nYou can relate to the other person how you can understand what they're thinking and you have to practice you have to practice it again and again and that's that's what the couple of dozen this book there are certain little things that the marriage counselor leads them through for example throughout the book the show\nIn each other and tell me what you see and as you read the book you'll see that they see more as they learn more until they're really can see the other person in a in a deep and meaningful way [noise]\nI said that we only me three characters in this book which is not exactly true because the way you right that's right it really is sort of a fourth character\nThere is which is the marriage itself it's the marriage itself and the marriage coats are actually sees the marriage as a distinct and real character she's actually listening to the marriage as the marriage changes in the office\nAnd she's trying to get the couple to be able to do that as well to see their marriages as something that they built over time that's very important and it's all live in a way that's different from each of them\n[noise] marriage rates have been going down for decades according to the Pew Research center today just about half of adults are married down from about Seventy five percent in the sixties or your family has clearly pro marriage why do you think this institution still matters\nWell I mean you're absolutely right my book is pro marriage um but it's not pro marriage in any kind of\nTransnational sense that we have to have marriage is pro and important relationship because it makes your life so much better you know I mean there's a reason that everybody wants to have a relationship it's like\nThe two of you individually are one thing but if you can get it together you\nLiterally become more than the two of you you can if you can create a important fulfilling relationship together do you think\nEvery marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor or is it really just sort of for people in crisis and dysfunction\nOkay I I think that every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor you know you may not have to go for four years\nBut I think that um you can really learn a lot I don't think you should settle for a marriage that just you know is okay I mean it's it's the critical thing in your life you want to marriage that's wonderful you want to marriage that that you can feel and talk to and that gives it back to you [noise]\nWell ... thank you so much for talking with us about your book well thank you so much this was

the alleged shooter Robert Bowers posted on social media he accused highest of bringing violent quote invaders into the United states\nBut ... says the president has ignored what powers posted online about immigrants\nThe reason he had targeted the Jewish community on this particular day is because he he saw Jews is helping refugees come into the country and the President Trump didn't mention

words matter and the especially matter when they come from the president of the United states\nWith just over a week to go before the midterm elections there is no reason to think that President Trump is planning to change his tone on immigration\nBy the end of his speech at the weekend rally President Trump was back to familiar talking points about quote criminal immigrants and vowing to stop the caravan of migrants that's slowly making its way across Mexico to the southwest border they have to come in legally\nLike all of the people that are waiting on line right now they can break into our borders they're not going to\nToday the department of defense announced that the president is sending thousands of troops to the southwest border and the White House is falling an executive order that would close the border to migrants\nThe president's supporters dismissed any connection between his rhetoric on immigration and the motivations of the Pittsburgh attacker\nTrying to understand this kind of behavior is impossible\nDan Stein is the president of the federation for American immigration reform which favors lower levels of immigration\nIt seems very cynical for people to try to take the ... you know the activity of deranged person to turn around and try to alter shape our national political debate on frankly one of the most important issues of our time\nBut immigrant rights advocates say that debate has been swamped by this information and fear mongering the alleged synagogue shooter for example shared conspiracy theories on social media about Jews supporting the migrant caravan mark Hatfield at highest says this kind of xenophobia is becoming more prevalent\nThere seems to be real fear it out there over the other and rather than addressing the sphere and confronting it these leaders that we have our stoking those fears\nThe president himself warned without evidence that there are quote unknown middle Easterners unquote mixed in with the caravan reporters for NPR

I Know this a quarter parents was largely procedural tell us what happened in court this afternoon\nYeah it was really like you said mostly procedural there wasn't a whole lot of you know guilt or innocence talk\nI'm basically say up was formally charged on five counts of federal crimes ranging from threatening former presidents to illegal mailings of explosives um remember he was arrested near Miami last friday he'd been driving a white van plastered with anti Democrat approach Trump's an anti media stickers\nAnd he'd apparently been living out of that band for we don't know exactly how long but for some time\nI'm In court today prosecutors basically said they don't want him to have the option of bail because they consider him a flight risk and danger to other people in the community\nWhat was his demeanor\nSo before the the hearing actually got started he was talking with his attorneys and he was wearing a he was he was shackled at the wrists and ankles and he was wearing a tan\nJumpsuit she didn't see much um but when he talked he did sound kind of defeated you could hear his his you could barely actually hear his voice at all it was it was quite raspy\n'em before the the proceedings you could I caught a glimpse of him tearing up and looked like his his attorneys kind of gathered around to to shield them from from the view once I started happening I'm the judge our summer series of questions you know do you understand the charges brought against you if you just kind of nodded I mean he looked\nSomewhat defeated I Would say um [noise] and the\n...

one prosecuting the case of many of the package bombs were meal there in that office has a long history of prosecuting these kinds of crimes that the trial itself I wouldn't bet on it happening
