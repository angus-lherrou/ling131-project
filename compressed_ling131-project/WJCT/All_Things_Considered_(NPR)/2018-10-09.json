so do people were you are seem to be taking the hurricane seriously enough at this point or the adequately preparing well\nIt's hard to say you know here in Tallahassee is very calm um you know we didn't get a lot of advance warning on this this hurricane to just kind of popped up over the weekend in the holiday weekend for some people and his government city\nSo I think a lot of people were slow to pick up on it plenty of water and other supplies still available the store's not big crowds here\nDown in Panama City as we heard of that big county area there is a much more concerned because that's near where the hurricane made make landfall its category three you know high winds a massive storm surge and so there's a lot of concern about getting people out there especially because a major bridge will be closed when the winds get too hot\nWhat about the Tallahassee area specifically what are the concerns there\nWell you know you have a couple of hundred thousand people who live in Tallahassee it's the capital of course and here the concern really is about ... of the high wins will get from a category three storm you know um will will get at least hurricane strength maybe a ... strong tropical storms wins but that there are a lot of trees and this in this town here\nAnd the trees come down to power lines come down and of course we lose power a it's a town that there's all these big ... live oak trees Spanish moss very picturesque city but these big trees have relatively shovel roots around and do a a guy named Harold barber who was up picking up last minute hurricane

and it get top heavy and you got that wind pushing it yeah they will come ...\nYou know two years ago her main was a category one hurricane but that one knocked out power here for some people for a week so there's a lot of concern what\nWe're hearing though is that ... are most worried about hurricane Michael's storm surge how high of a surge are we talking here at this point\nRight this could one of those we haven't had a hurricane like this and quite some time or maybe ever in this part of Florida and depending on the track you may see an eight to twelve foot storm surge meteorologist say in the Big Bend area you know and that's the corner where the witness looks next to the panhandle in Florida\nAnd they'll be significant search all along the panhandle going uh west that would be that's the reason for that all these coastal counties have had these evacuations it's the water that actually is the risk to life and limb\nAnd it has to do with the geography here the continental shelf extends real far out into the Gulf is relatively shallow water just piles up and that we may see here ah tomorrow\nOK That's NPR's Greg Allen in Tallahassee thanks very much crank\nYou're welcome now\nTo the Supreme Court where this morning protesters had a message for the newest justice\n\n\nOnly days after the Senate voted narrowly to confirm him Brett Kavanaugh made his first appearance on the high court bench\nAnd her national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was watching the oral arguments and she's here now to tell us about them Harry Hi Mary Louise so we heard the protesters outside the court what was it like inside today well after all the rancor of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings in the Senate things were quiet inside the court know disruptions no arrest\nKavanaugh's wife actually was there his two daughters skipped school to attend\nRetired Justice Anthony Kennedy was there to of course Kevin replaced him on the bench\nAnd at the start of the day chief justice John Roberts said it gives me great pleasure to welcome justice cabin out of the court and Roberts wished him along and happy career\nHe has been busy already has hired for clerks all of them women I Will note uh we're told he spent the weekend reading up on ... did he actually speak much from the bench today he was really active for his first day on the job I counted more than ten questions from him to both sides mostly technical questions about the state of the law\nThe court today heard two cases about what kinds of crimes should trigger the arm career criminal act Congress passed\nThat law to take dangerous people off the street it sends them away for mandatory prison terms if they have prior violent crimes in their past the question for the court today was whether certain kinds of robberies or burglaries counted or not\nIt sounds like neither of those cases today or ones with big political or ideological divide winner cases going to come before him that would test this new five for makeup of the court\nDocket is not super polarized so far but there is a good chance the high court will consider whether to accept some cases that could wind up being blockbusters cases that they have to do with President Obama's docket immigration plan\nCases they might hit religious liberty against the rights of algae P. T. people or cases about the power in return to the executive branch at least one of the justices today appear to be playing a long game that's Elena Kagan she was appointed by President Obama but she and Brett Kavanaugh go back away she hired him to teach at Harvard law school when she was a dean there\nThey behaved very warmly together today laughed a lot and he shook her hand as he left the bench the issue is whether she's trying a charm offensive on this new justice to get him to be a more moderate figure on this bench overtime huh\nBut what about the fear that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle was so partisan whatsoever and Chris I think is the word you used that there would be this cloud of partisanship paying over him and a hangover the court did you see any\nSign of that not in the courtroom today Brett Kavanaugh of course introduced some of this himself in the Senate when he mentioned in organized campaign to go after him even citing the Clintons\nHe spoke Monday Night at a ceremony at the White House saying he wanted to be impartial unfair and part of a team of nine justices on the court but Kavanaugh off went out of his way at that event at the White House to thanks senators who made the difference in his confirmation people like Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd President Trump did not help manners when he said Kavanaugh\nHad been proven innocent of assault allegations that actually did not happen the president also apologized cabin on Monday for what he called the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to him during this campaign to get on the bench there was no hint of any of that in the Supreme\nCourt today a very different story inside the Supreme Court it sounds like a thanks very much carry my pleasure That's NPR's Carrie Johnson [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nAnd you're listening to all things considered this afternoon on eighty nine nine companies J.

surprise resignation from the White House Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations says she will step down by the end of the year\nWhen she and President Trump spoke to reporters at the White House today they took turns praising each other\nShe's done an incredible job she's a fantastic person very importantly but she also\nIs somebody that gets it\nAnd Haley tried preemptively to answer a question about her future\nFor all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what I'll be doing is paying for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nAll right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now to talk about all of that same Mara Hi Elsa so why now why is he is stepping down now\nWell that is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote a resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my down to look so good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's terminal I mean we're self she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure forum so for someone who does want to run for president may be some time in the future time to go make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but\nIt made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as kind of a rap deserting the sinking ship right might have been held yeah\nSo the thing is different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration that he seems to be leaving on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nIt sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a in a cellar right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThis independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that's true of\nMany relatives of his foreign policy team but she has been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits are purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia than Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley is confused and she reported very friendly and said I don't get confused by other day she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different with the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately not some Republicans grumbled\nIt was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burnish around brand as someone independent foreign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually could kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician\nSo as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but are we to assume that this is really the end of her political\nCareer we are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty um she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run and twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina F. one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established\nAnd it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared\nWas such a hidden genius that no one understands of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley so she is staying on good terms with all the members\nOf the

know that Chang this morning began with a surprise resignation from the White House Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations says she will step down by the end of the year\nWhen she and President Trump spoke to reporters that the White House today they took turns praising each other\nShe's done an incredible job she's a fantastic person very importantly but you also\nIs somebody that gets it\nAnd Haley tried preemptively to answer a question about her future\nFor all on here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can tell me she went I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nAnd All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now to talk about all of this Hey Mara Hi Elsa so why now why is Haley stepping down now\nWell that is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote her resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my down to look so good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's ... she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure forum\nSo for someone who does want to run for president maybe some time in the future time to go make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as kind of a rat deserting the sinking ship right ...\nYeah so that they have different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration has that Haley seems to be leaving on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case yes\nIt sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a nest seller right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThe goal persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that's true of\nMany relatives of his foreign policy team but she has been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits her purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia and Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley is confused and she retarded very friendly and said I don't get confused today she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different with the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately now some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burnish her own brand as someone independent\nForeign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician\nSo as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but\nAre we to assume that this is really the end of her political career we are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty\nUm she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run and twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina F. one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established\nAnd it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared\nWas such a hidden genius that no one understands of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley so she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump\nFamily That's NPR's
