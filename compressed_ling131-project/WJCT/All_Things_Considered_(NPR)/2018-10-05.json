{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "Giving a surprise [noise]\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine speaking live on the Senate for for about forty three minutes and\nMaking the news right there at the end that she will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court now Republicans have a fifty one to forty nine majority in the U.S Senate Democrats needed to Republicans to flip in order to stop Kavanaugh from being confirmed on the court\nJeff Flake is yes Susan Collins is a yes vote is tomorrow NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg Kevin I was going to be on the Supreme Court [noise]\nCertainly looks that way because there are they have fifty votes and depending on what a senator Manchin of West Virginia does um they could have fifty one if they don't have fifty one and they only have fifty than a vice president the vice president can cast the tie breaking vote\nA native before we let her from a senator Collins France Germany said forty three minutes um we were talking about what happens when you have a a a something like having a who is seen as a partisan he's worked in White Houses he didn't come up strictly through\nThe court system and she addressed some of that at least to the idea that people felt that he will be appointed so that he could help out President Trump should he ever get into trouble she made the case that Kevin I told her and she knew that he was asking Congress to pass a law to protect\nPresidents and she took that as a demonstration that he already knew that presidents were protected why don't you think of her addressing questions people have about you know the partisanship\nOf Kavanaugh well\nJudge Kavanaugh has been a judge and a distinguished and very conservative judge for twelve years and he had and I suppose you would say still has a fine reputation in some ways the the\nThe problem was\nAt this became such a\nSome people say it's a circus some peace people say it's a it's a flashpoint whenever you want to call it\nHis testimony was so overtly partisan or when he came back for the second round accusing Democrats of a orchestrating a well funded political hit\nA on behalf of the Clintons a it was the vengeance of the Clinton The Revenge of the Clintons I think is what he said and that was so overtly political and so out of character for people who have known judge Kavanaugh for a very long time\nThat it it was in the words of one\nPerson who has worked with him over many years the dropping of a veil and scary dropping the veil and he tried to put the to mix are metaphors here to try to put the genie back in the bottle with a a\nAn op ed piece that he wrote in the wall Street Journal today in which he said he regretted some of the things he said but he never said what do specific things were and if as I assume he will be he's confirmed he will face a a period of\nTrying to persuade I suppose the outside world that's probably the as well as probably the inside world and the court that he is not bad part isn't that he showed himself to be on this one occasion\nScott Detrow your thoughts on what we've just seen\nOf thoughts but I think a chief among them is that a Susan\nOwens portrayed herself as an undecided swing vote on Brett Kavanaugh and I think that was sincere\nBefore Ford's allegations came out cause was very clear that that she was likely leaving yes on Capitol she felt satisfied and our conversations with him that he would not overturn roe v way that that he was more moderate and conservative despite his his voting record\nA but what she did here and and we know that she spent several several hours multiple trips to that secure room reading this FBI report but what she did here was say I will announce my vote got all of America\nTo tune in including us during the special cover I just have to to stop you right there to say that we've just heard the Joe mansion is also going to be a yes for capping off so that if the one fifty one forty nine he'll be like ... will not have to break the tie a threat but okay so so she\nShe gets all America to tune in and then she delivers\nA closing argument for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court that couldn't be better scripted from his supporters this is a moderate woman who's who's not viewed as a partisan firebrand making a case by case point for his temperament for his traditional ruling and then really are going through even though she kept saying that she believed that Ford\nUh was sincere and compelling really poking a lot of holes in her argument in a way that I think a lot of people who supported Ford will view is undermining our national television so this was really quite something\nWas and how you you said something that we were sort of saying to each other while this was happening we were tells you is going to be making an announcement about her vote but he really did turn into a forty three minute\nClosing arguments some Republicans and a very good one to one but what do you make a of how she\nSpoke of the Democrats she would go out of a way to say that Dianne Feinstein was a good friend but accused them of also but uh putting a a Christine Blasey Ford in a terrible situation\nYou know there's one thing here and and please guys if I've got something wrong that I think is is is a little bit off in in the factual right a timeline and that is a day in science and got this letter in July ... or early August and kept confidential\nOr somebody leaked the fact that there was such a letter or\nTo intercept the online news organization and but without Christine Blasey Ford's name and shortly thereafter\nA bunch of reporters got for one way or another got the name but I Do not believe that her letter was actually leak\nTo the existence of the letter that it was just the it was the existence\nOf the lead or not the letter himself\nAnd I'm speaking is somebody who knows something about these kinds of things one state you know that there is this kind of complaint\nUm the number of people who who actually know a little more grows exponentially and therefore it the ability of reporters to find it out grows exponentially and then in this case Christine Blasey Ford\nOnce reporters started contacting her said I'm going to talk to the Washington Post I called them originally they kept my confidentiality I'm going to talk to them and not anybody\nJust in the minute we have left here as we wrap up our coverage of this event this afternoon in Washington Scott Detrow uh I was down at the court earlier today talking to some of the protesters who have shown up there to try to stop cabinet\nAnd they believe that this was going to happen that he would be confirmed a they also said that they're going to use that this November these are Democrats will use that this November what does this mean just in thirty seconds for the midterms\nYeah we ... we had seen a narrowing it more enthused yeah I'm On the Republican side I Wonder if this reports that again a this was about a year remarkably since the me too movement started now and a lot of people's minds are of course the buggy Ford has been ignored by the Senate and they're going to put Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court\nIs NPR's Scott Detrow and Nina Totenberg with Jeremy in Washington Jeremy you're gonna be staying there do similar programming on by\nKevin I'm

to have enough support in the U.S Senate to be confirmed as a Supreme\nCourt justice today's friday October fifth on this is all things considered from NPR News\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro has this hour full coverage of the protests for politics and the vote on Brett\nKavanaugh also will take a break from Washington politics to consider politics in Brazil where they are gearing up for the most divisive presidential election in decades\nWe've had enough with male politician\nAnd rebels who think they\nCan say whatever they want and there are no repercussion\n... new memoir about growing up surrounded by love and laughter and a mother who use\nDrugs I definitely always felt that my mother love me but I also felt total abandonment those stores ahead after the news headlines\nI Do I I I found a lot of the conversation I'm from Republicans about sort of how this played out with the fact that I'm fine thank office had these allegations for as long as they had them and sat on them\nThere was a lot of anger from folks that you don't normally see anger from um particularly Lindsey Graham and Ben fast you're sort of\nThe more moderate level headed Republicans\nAnd um and there was a lot of past tense use of you know we were friends we used to work together\nUm and I I think the anger doesn't go away for a while\nReally what do you think is the son of going to be able to move on from this or has it poisons some of the relationship for lawmakers really need to get things done I mean look I think the partisanship that was a happy\nAnd that's present in the Senate ah existed long before this confirmation battle this certainly exacerbated it or to a greater extent we saw the pressure that was placed on the moderates\nIn the Senate like Senator Collins like Senator mansion um I I Would disagree that ah it's Senator Graham is still considered one of the more level headed members of the Senate right now he seems to be really really a spokesperson basically for President Trump at this point and that's the role he served throughout this confirmation process but\nThe Senate is a tough place for moderates to be right now and I think that only a grows more so\nLooking beyond Congress this controversy has prompted some women to share stories of abuse from years or decades ago um for example a newscaster Connie Chung told her story of sexual assault in the Washington Post this week\nOn two was ... he was like all that about two years ago the mullah through our our ...\nWe're now one year after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke and launched the me too movement and so I Wonder what it is about this Kavanaugh for debate that is making people speak out now who might not have told their stories after wind scene or Bill Cosby or any of the others Kimberly what are you saying\nPull up talking to women who have called me emails me to tell their stories of sexual assault which is happening with a lot of journalists uh\nLately I think the idea that someone who is accused of this could reach a level of such power despite women coming forward and telling their stories about that it's really alarming to them uh it's not about I mean a lot of these women we were talking about how the anger of women he's one of them were angry they were more gutted\nOr that this could happen that these stories of women even if folks say like center called and said that she believes that Dr Ford suffered some thing but that there's no proof that it was well the idea usually when it's an acquaintance situation that\nA memory works that way I mean Dr Cavanaugh is a scientist she explains how memory works in her own contacts and that if she couldn't even be believed enough to stop this that there is a concern that this is really a system that's rigged against women\nBethany I Know you've written with some degree of skepticism about of Ford's account against Kavanaugh what do you think the consequences of this episode will be for society more broadly\nSo I I I think that it's an important to have about sexual assault but I think that this is also an and Collins spoke to a great deal and her in her commentary on the floor\nThere's also a presumption of innocence and there's an expectation that you can't bring for these kinds of serious allegations that can\nDismantle an entire career without any cooperation and unfortunately there wasn't in this case I'm In the case of ray Moore when he came up\nAnd accusers came forward to the Alabama Senate race yeah yeah there there was there's cooperation that a lot of his accusers had that that made their accounts convincing and I I didn't personally see that in in any of these circumstances\nI also want to ask you both about the political consequences of this debate because when Ford first testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats and Republicans called her credible and express sympathy and admiration for her willingness to speak publicly this week some took on a different tone starting with President Trump here he was at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was\nThe audience laughed and applauded and at that same rally Trump said this is a very scary time for young men in America with the midterms one month away Bethany do think this will have an impact\nYeah absolutely and we're we're already seeing that as far as fundraising and and sort of enthusiasm from Republicans this has been\nA very unifying moment for Republicans I mean we we saw Brett the events and the New York times applied to President Trump and that's something that I don't think anyone thought that they would have seen three weeks ago let alone um let on now but\nThis is this is really I think going to to drum up a lot of enthusiasm on the right in a way that hasn't existed since twenty sixteen\nCan really do think that I'm Susie ... will last for the next month if Kavanaugh is confirmed for the court this weekend is expected\nI think that's a still unclear I mean there are definitely was a fear Republicans told me they were afraid that the poor part of their base would revolt against them if they didn't get Kavanaugh through now that won't happen it seem more like a defensive play I\nI don't know if that's enough to counteract the energy that we're seeing right now on the other side that spurred by this sort of gender war it seems that's being a exacerbated by the president's ah with the comments that you played\nA I think that really spurs the other side the losing side traditionally is the one with the momentum after a fight like this and just\nBriefly from each of you now that it looks like Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court apart from the shift to the right ideologically that he was expected to bring to the court to each of you think that the echoes of this fight will linger in the Supreme Court itself Kimberly\nIt could I mean look Clarence Thomas still speaks with a lot of disdain about his own confirmation process so it's very possible this is a consensus building a group that's how they have to be at a function so it's tough to see how that doesn't play a role\nAnd briefly Bethany I'll give you the last word\n[noise] yeah I I I think that this has radicalized a lot of people and I think having a ... one of them I I I'm not sure how much of this sort of\nThis experience has impacted his judicial opinions but I I Can't see that it hasn't changed his mind somehow about due process about the presumption of innocence um I I think that there's probably did maybe pushing more right were then he would have otherwise been had to spend as smooth confirmation process\nThat's Bethany Mandela editor of ... and columnist for the forward and Kimberly ... chief Washington reporter and columnist for the Boston Herald thanks to both of you

nominee among the people gathered at the White House for the big announcement was John Malcolm Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington\nA think tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees John Malcolm joins me now welcome it's a pleasure being with you\nAnd my writing thinking you're pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now increasingly likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate just some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there I Would let you address some of the questions that have been raised to that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs assigned to the road and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think this is his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she ... she said questions there that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think sure well\nWe don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals and\nWho knew him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week while testifying\nWell that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as a family that he would have acted like a comment on I\nHad by the way he acted like in ...\nI think that response would had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter] do you think oh God there's a lot of kids who who are going to go through what I'm going through or what I what I went through\nThere

I'm going to get to the effect on the court in a second but start with the partisanship that a lot of people saw on display when Brett Kavanaugh testified last week he talked about the\n... that he was being targeted as revenge for the Clintons you've covered a lot of Supreme Court confirmation fights have had you ever seen anything like that\nLook in historical terms nothing like this has ever happened before\nA Supreme Court nominee using part isn't language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition purely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact\nCaused retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against the nominee\nAnd he said that he'd light cabinet as a judge even put his picture and one of his books because of a decision to Kevin wrote but Kavanaugh's demeanor and partisanship Stevenson Steven said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that apparent bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the root of the core who it is not the ill see they get a new justice you know all they do put a part time job\nNow I don't really think the Kavanaugh as likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today and the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify which ones\nIt appears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate today that um plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens than others so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it should be above politics\nWell the justices will grit their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect chief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts in best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once\nAnd all of this cannot be sitting well with him yeah\nRepublican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on some of these questions she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nMy fervent hall is that Brett Kavanaugh\nTo less than that ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions\n[noise] how big a challenge is that going to be enough for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just are you have to do is look at his record\nCollins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he is firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so I Would\nIndeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes\nWhere the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that end than any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the sense of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes as expected this weekend how quickly would you expect him to be seated\nI Would expect him to be seated probably Tuesday Morning\n[noise] wow NPR's Nina Totenberg thanks as always thank you [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\n\nAnd you're listening to all things considered this afternoon on eighty nine nine ...

Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has been divisive and bruising and many fear it has been damaging to revered institutions the U.S Senate and the Supreme Court\nRon Elving is senior editor and correspondent on Washington desk here with NPR News and he is in our studio to talk about this higher on ... to be with you Ari\nIt's always been known for a special kind of ... geology where members can work together respectfully despite political differences and reach compromises for the sake of a greater good that's been deteriorating for a while now do you think the Kavanaugh's confirmation process\nHas done even further damage it's\nThe latest symptom of an infection that's been present for some while we've had parties in the Senate almost from the very beginning but there have usually been at least a few conservatives and the liberal party liberals in the conservative party lots of moderates in between\nThe politics of the last quarter century however have been purging those crossovers and those moderates even those who now remains sound increasingly like hardcore partisans\nAnd here's Sen Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina thought of at times in the past as something of a matter of brick somebody who can talk to both parties here he is at the Senate Judiciary committee hearing a week ago addressing the Democrats across the room\nBoy y'all power God I Hope you never get it of course Lindsey Graham is referring here to the mid term elections next month when Democrats had hoped to have at least an outside chance of getting back in the majority Lindsey Graham\nNew cameras were rolling then does language like that actually poisoned the kinds of relationships and interactions that you see behind closed doors or some of us just for formative\nWe should say there have always been occasions of heated rhetoric and angry words uh and especially from certain members at certain times but as you say that collegial nature of the chamber and belongs six year terms that they have and the need for certain ... arrangements in super majorities that they have to get\nThat tended to bring people together\nBring them into a more cooperative mode of operation but that can break down and that is what democratic leader Chuck Schumer was referring to this morning on the Senate floor when he concluded his argument for rejecting Kevin\nFor the sake of the center\nMy colleagues will do so\nWe've been talking about the impact this fight is having on the Senate what about the Supreme Court where if confirmed Kavanaugh might serve for decades do you think this will have a long term impact\nThere it will be a burden on the members of the court who have proven remarkably good at times at least at subsumed Ming their political differences within the larger relationship to each other and to the court and to the country and to the law\nNow that gets harder after a confirmation process such as this process that is stressed by the collision of major movements within the culture\nWithin the Supreme Court for years we've heard stories about justices with ideological differences having close friendships having a relationship that flourishes even though there might be on opposite sides of a political divide do you think this affects\nBack kind of dynamic\nIt could and that is what concerns people the relationship between for example Antonin Scalia the anchor of the conservative wing and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are very different justice and yet quite close friend who was which every New Year's eve together and go to operas together and taught\nThat kind of college geology is stressed when you have a candidate who comes to board with a background of this sort of a confirmation process it's not that the court can't deal with it but it will\nMake the court more visible doesn't mean they have to come out from underneath always rubs doesn't mean that suddenly we're going to have CSPAN with that they're going to stop their very small group conferences but it does mean that for many people the court has been identified as something different from what it was before\nNPR's Ron Elving as a senior editor and
