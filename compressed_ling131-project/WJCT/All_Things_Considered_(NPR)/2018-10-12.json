{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "A podcast called the real news tells a story of America's relationship to sickle cell through the lens of proud of Jesus' life and death\nFrom the disease Christopher Johnson is co host of the real messy podcast from WNYC Studios Christopher welcome to science friday Ira hello nice to talk to you how did you come across prodigy song of a and a story of sickle cell anemia\nSo we are the health unit my co host Mary Harris and I\nI'm here at WNYC we went looking trawling for some new stories to tell and we wanted to move away from just looking at one of the stories that just lasted for a few minutes we actually kind of want to do to do these deep dies and tell deep health stories through the lives of of real people\nAnd so Mary found this story about sickle cell anemia and\nHow how it's kind of represents a lot of the health disparities in this country and felt like it could be a good springboard\nAnd one of the doctors and she spoke to told asked her about prodigy who had recently died he had sickle cell and she knew about the sickle cell piece of it I knew ... music from being a hip hop and from when his group Bob deepest getting big in the mid nineties and we kind of took it took it from there\nAmongst later this is science friday from WNYC Studios [noise] now the ... the the lyrics were pretty stark my handicap took a toll on my sanity pretty strong words\nYeah you have to do yeah yeah I mean he it is as far as I Know the one song that he wrote explicitly about his life with sickle cell anemia\nEven though he was born with it of course and it was something that really really um shaped his life it's it can be an excruciating disease\nI'm it's extremely painful especially for him\nAnd uh he grew up having these crises from the time that he was a baby and um and it took to his music a lot but a lot of people didn't necessarily know that he had sickle cell um until he passed away\nThey didn't know that even from his music no one was questioning why did you use those lyrics\nYeah yeah I mean he people will people knew and they didn't know he didn't talk a whole lot about it if you look at the full sort of canon of his music both as half of the hip hop group of deep and also solo rapper he just didn't talk about as\n... as an African American to this story hit home for you and serve as a catalyst for the for the real miss\nA it out and it absolutely did I mean for for me\nIt's it's both about sickle cell specifically and it's also about the reality of health care disparities in this country and even for someone like prodigy who as a celebrity as this superstar as someone especially in the mid nineties was successful and had access\nTo the best treatment even as a child he had one of the best doctors working in sickle cell he still went through what he went through\nWere you a little surprised when you know when you you knew that he had sickle cell that he did not in talk about it in his ... as he and his music as something I'm using my music as a way to win for more people about it\nI mean I I wasn't really surprised I mean knowing music from that era and looking at the image of a group like mob deep um I didn't have a chance to ask you this but I Would guess that that along with that music comes an image of toughness and sort of ... and ...\nLike sickle cell and this idea that he was constantly Iraq with pain was probably not something that he wanted to put out there in fact ... Tupac\nIn one of his songs that was basically a distract aimed at all these other rappers\nIncluded mob deep in in that song to pop used he sort of weaponized sickle cell and use it as kind of a part of his disk at mob deep so prodigy probably was not interested in putting out there that he had this disease that made him or they may have made him appear weak\nHuh I imagine in in in preparation for your your ... your story in the real issue must have had to learn a lot about sickle cell absolutely a lotta Linus Pauling tea [laughter] and you learn why these diseases so painful what it does to the body yeah absolutely\nIt I'm so very very basically the way that it works is that of a normally are red blood cells are so shape like lifesavers and their smooth and they move through our body a fairly smoothly with sickle cell does what Linus Pauling found was that\nIt causes this glitch in the hemoglobin which is part of our red blood cells it's where I carry the oxygen through the blood it ... it causes the ... the ... the cells to\nKind of take on a half moon or like a cup fingernail clipping shape is how I looked at it they sickle and they get sticky and tacky and they can clog up the veins and when you exert yourself exercise walking upstairs even it can cause pain all over the body and that was\n... and a lot of people can be carriers of it and not know that they have\nIt exactly you can have the trade and not have full blown sickle cell and you can also have full blown sickle cell and that experience it to the extent that prodigy experienced it yeah I'm\nFrom I Want to thank you very much for for taking time to say hey thanks for having me on to it's a great series grocery Johnson co host of the real news from a WNYC Studios and uh so so great story thanks again and you can check out the real must podcast by going to science friday dot com slash the real mess\nAnd we're going to thank all of folks who helped us today want to want to thank BJ Lederman who composed our theme music and also thanks to Dr Michelle Mulholland to provided us with those squirrel monkey calls\nAnd a very special thanks to all the great folks here at the K.

Jacksonville your community your world clear skies overnight a low of sixty one sunny this weekend highs and the loaded mid eighties overnight lows in sixty\nThousand trained disaster personnel on their way more than ... people are ...\n... and then on the Florida Panhandle to provide relief after hurricane Michael friday October twelfth and this is all things considered from NPR News\nI'm also Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly coming up the U.S trade deficit with China is Afghan tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration are not\nHaving the desired effect\nUs exports to China have really taken a hit\nWhen they are impose their care of those experts really were stopped in their tracks\nLater us pastor is on his way home after being released from turkey where he was held for years and Lin Manuel Miranda latest project a book a pep talk we'll talk with the illustrator\nWe wanted it to just be this object to this kind of comforting thing that kept people companies wrote their day now he's lived\nAnother way they've been describing the people who've turned out to protest his by using the word mob by calling the angry left mob like Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has that the Senate Senator Marco Rubio of Florida Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa\nWhat we have learned is the resist that has existed since the day after the November sixty twenty sixteen New Yorker\nIs centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged mob rule\nMob rule can with some sort of coordinated strategy this week I think several Republicans who just happen to use the word\nWell I think they've decided this is a good talking point of course it wasn't all that long ago that the sound of a you know angry protesters was actually music to Republican airs back when it was the Tea Party\nProtestors who were making it impossible for members of Congress to go to their own town halls without a police escort and of course we have a president in the in the White House who has on a regular basis encouraged people at his own rallies to inflict violence on on protesters there\nBut I think that the Republicans have decided uh first of all I guess how ... is nothing new in politics but they have decided that\nThey see their own base a lot more energized in the wake of this um this whole fight over Kavanaugh and they also think that\nThey can use this ... this idea of mob rule as a you know as a way of bringing home the idea of what would it be like if Democrats are given back any of the levers of power\nBut tainted I mean these were mob a lot of the protesters these Republicans are referring to are women could describing women's response to all of this mob like backfire for Republicans among women voters this maternal\nIf I don't think so [laughter] you know uh we we we ... we live in an age of political polarization than what what they call negative polarization which means you don't particularly have like your own party or you just have to really hate the other one so the crucial or the crucial issue is argue appalled\nDo field appalled at this moment and that's what motivates people to get active and to go to the polls and Democrats have been appalled pretty steadily for two years the Republicans had little to be appalled about but now they feel really appalled and the core message in a world of negative polarization is the people so your bed a really bad themselves\nAnd this is essentially the message Republicans are now driving home and they've eliminated the Democratic advantage and enthusiasm and in red states and blue states but in red states you begin to see the poll switching over to Republican direction\nHow about that I mean David right both sides have clearly been galvanized by Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings were less than four weeks away from this midterm election turns you see that fresh energy driven by the confirmation hearings reshaping battle lines\nAbsolutely if you look at the polls and again we have four more weeks before this election and ah in this era for weeks is what you know for years used to be um it it does appear that\nThat this may be helping the Democrats in the house races but it could be helping the Republicans in the Senate races in part because where those Senate battlegrounds are they are\nUh the the biggest prize is in this in the Senate elections are largely democratic held seats in states that Donald Trump won\nAnd um we are seeing a significant amount of movements in those polls toward the Republicans but you think it could help Democrats and house races because of the suburban women do it to that the the biggest battleground say are are largely in the suburbs where we had you know again the the women's vote is going to be absolutely crucial\nOkay I'm going to switch gears now Karen late last week your paper the Washington Post's had a big blank space on the opinion page where a column from one of your papers journalists to market show he should've been ... has been a critic of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman he's\nHe disappeared about ten days ago after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and he has now\nSeem to be dead your paper Karen tied his disappearance all the way to the crown prince personally how your colleagues make that direct link to being someone\nWell you're right that the you know increasingly the presumption a by intelligence sources on Capitol Hill in the White House is that our colleague a Jamal ... is dead end that Saudi Arabia is to blame and one of the biggest pieces of evidence or U.S intelligence report that\nThat shows that the crown prince actually ordered an operation to lure him back to Saudi Arabia where he was supposed to be detained\nThat the timing of all this is unclear but it is\nA it's if what we're hearing from from Turkish sources is true which is that a essentially is a hit squad of Fifteen people was waiting for him in in the consulate\nUm is just impossible to imagine that some kind of that an operation like that would not have happened without the knowledge and approval of the very top levels of of the Saudi Government\nAnd when President Trump was asked\nAbout 'cause she'll be in the oval office yesterday about an arms deal with the Saudis and this is how he answered\nWill like John we'd all like we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to me\nHe didn't let me turn if you let me turn this should the u._s. be selling arms to Saudi Arabia right now\nWill give the president credit for almost a usually when people sell their sole they tried to deny that there certainly is a pretty honest that were selling a democratic principles were selling human rights were sowing as us residents life down to two for for money\nOr even stipulate at a price and so it's sort of ... looks like the axis of greed and we'll the Saudis are part of it ah and the second thing but it seems clear here so we have spent the last couple of years sucking up to the Saudis\nAnd you would think if that would have a good effect on Saudi foreign policy you'd think they wouldn't do the sort of thing and so the idea of flattering people to get them to do your thing flattering really dictatorial regimes that does not seem to work so that's it's a low and so leading moment for American foreign policy\nRight that David Brooks in the New York times and ... of the Washington Post thanks you guys both for coming in today [noise]\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered this afternoon on eighty nine nine W.

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly we're going to spend the next few minutes talking about spies specifically Russian Spies not normally there might not be that much to talk about some spy craft is supposed to be invisible but lately Russian Spies have been all over the headlines\nWe have got to stories and in a moment we're going to meet a group of investigators who have been busy on ... Russian intelligence officers\nFirst we're going to dig into these headlines about the G argue Russian military intelligence and here to help us do that as NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre ... Hi Mary Louise so that you are you has been around for\nA century since ... around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution but safe to say for a lot of us here in America the first time we heard about them was twenty sixteen\nThat's correct from the election hacking but these are very busy guys and girls um\nThey have been involved in this ongoing case of to G R U agents allege agents who are accused of poisoning Sergei Skripal and Britain he's a former G R U agent himself who had had a traitor Dennis ... swap was living in Britain\nThe difference though this case is filled with lots of glaring almost comedic screw up some first of all screwball and his daughter survived the attack in March which was was clearly not the intent\nFascination attempt that did not manage to assassinate the two people who were being targeted and go on\nThat is correct and the two suspects were seen on the security cameras which are all over Britain and then the suspects go bad are back in Russia and they make this very strange appearance on on Russian television to explain what they were doing insults\nBarry but we were\nSo the\nSo there are just blading they're explaining this solved there is is beautiful town and they were just tourists and of course if you are going to to England\nYou would make a trip to solve their to see this a church tower the hundred and twenty three meters high um and and they said well it was cold and fluffy and so they turned around after a couple of days and and headed back to Russia\nOkay so fast forward to this month to October and to some equally questionable spy craft on display and then other ones right\nAnd so this is sort of the follow up the Dutch announced just last week that they've caught for they say gee argue agents ah with high tech equipment in a rental car outside the office for the prohibition of chemical weapons which was testing the chemicals apparently\nSince the attack back in March um now they were caught in a rental car they apparently tried to smash some of this equipment one of the phones or was apparently traced to a G R U headquarters in Moscow had only been used a couple of days earlier\nI'm even found a receipt for a taxi or from the barracks to the airport in Moscow\nIt sounds so clumsy it almost makes you wonder if they want him to be caught or at least didn't care if they were caught I think what we\nCould say is they really don't seem to care if they're caught the Russians just deny deny deny on there's no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of actions\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions by we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise]\nUm so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do to see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents Greg Myre thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no tentative conclusion other than the Russians fake was ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they were traveling underwriters says I'm visa ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge told her works for a group called spelling cat his job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works tolerant as friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operations ... fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen the U.S economy is growing and doing well our trade deficit goes up because we're buying a lot more from the rest of the world and try and of course is a major supplier\nIrwin says part of the reason people are spending more as the Trump tax cuts which uh put more money in people's pockets the dollar is stronger against China's currency and there's another reason that trade gap is wider when the U.S imposed tariffs on China China retaliated with tariffs of its own\nA U.S exports to China really taken a hit particularly soybeans and other agricultural commodities when they are ... um those exports really were stopped in their tracks\nThis dynamic could change as the euro goes on the U.S is scheduled to increase tariffs on Chinese goods even more in January is trade talks with Beijing haven't yielded any results\nThat may finally make Chinese products expensive enough that American consumers buy fewer of them Jim Zarroli NPR News\nWith us instead of compulsively reaching for your phone you can reach for a book\nWe wanted it to just be this object that was this kind of comforting thing that kept people companies wrote their day\nThat is Johnny son he's an illustrator who collaborated on such a companion with Lynn man well Miranda as in Hamilton Lin Manuel Miranda\nI was aware of him much earlier than he was with me [laughter] but eventually I think we just we started realizing that we were kind of floating in the same space and um that's sort of how we got to know each other\nThat base was on Twitter of all places and that space with a happy encouraging one Miranda want it to collect his daily tweets that he called the morning and night in a book he\nWrites things such as the morning gracious are smiling it's contagious and can night then good gracious year one for the ages\nSon tweeted at Miranda that he had ideas about how this book could come together and that is how Johnny son ended up illustrating Miranda words in their new book can morning goodnight little pep talks for me Andy you Johnny ... explains some of the thinking behind it the\nTwitter feed and kind of social media in general is\nMeant to be ephemeral and I think when when I moved from like on line to off line it becomes more of like this capsule or something and it's meant to be visited and it's meant to be a little more time with and I think the the difference between like the affair morality of social media and sort of the permanence of a book was the reason to do the book\nI Love that Twitter can be memorialized tastefully [laughter]\nSo do you have a favorite illustration in this book or our favorite pairing between when a your drawings and when it blends sweet\nOh man there are so many I think the\nThe real joy of it was really working with Lynn to make sure that the illustrations were reflective of him we spent some time going through each of the tweets and he kind of gave me like the director of commentary of each kind of passage\nAnd told me like here's how he was feeling this day here's what he was thinking of and um the drug for me was taking all of that stuff and trying to fit it into an image\nSo I was flipping through this book and I came across this tweet do not get stuck in the comments section of life today make do create the things let others tussle it out\nNeither Lin Manuel Miranda words but they made me think of you because because you started your whole public persona on Twitter any by definition you were stuck in the comments section\nOh why Twitter why did you choose that medium to introduce yourself to the world\nIt's it's funny that you frame it as like choosing to do this thing because I think for me I just had turned to Twitter as this organic way to sort of connect with people\nI had um just moved to the U. S. for school I had a a grown up in Toronto and um I realize I had lost touch with a lot of mine comedy friends and a lot of my writer friends in Toronto and so I'd\nAnd it turned to Twitter because I found a lot of people doing really interesting stuff onto it or they were writing um humor and writing fiction and just sharing interesting pieces and thoughts and aspect of their lives on line and I thought like this is such a great\nSpace and community to play and and I just wanted to like I just wanted to be part of it all an optimist [laughter] I mean it\nSeems easier dine out and say this is so vital and toxic and poison [laughter]\nRight absolutely and like I absolutely don't mean to discount any of that because that is such a huge issue with um with Internet culture and just like the social media space in general um I I Do think\nThough that there are pockets of of genuine like goodness and I think that's that's the really hard part to find is to is to is to find those\nFind those people and find those communities that are just people trying to connect with each other and I think that's really powerful\nYou talk about dealing with depression on Twitter\nYou able to find a community and people who\nGot what you were saying got your struggle like has Twitter helped actually deal with that part of your life [noise] [noise] yeah\nAbsolutely I think it's actually it's I feel like it's the other way around where like Twitter was so thing that made me understand my mental health better ... like I had not grown up knowing that therapy was an option for me\nAnd it was it was only after I got on Twitter and sort of started falling a lot of people and I saw them talking about mental health I'm\nReally for the first time in an an stigmatized away and in a way that felt just normal and every day I realized a lot of this stuff is stuff that I feel\nAnd they started talking about therapy and\nI thought maybe this might be something that would help me\nAnd it turns out that it did help me and it turns out that um I Do suffer from anxiety and depression and um\nAll of that stuff I Would not have realized that I Would not have sort of um been able to address had it not been for signing these people on line that we're talking about it yeah so yeah and so I feel like this enormous I guess responsibility to\nPass that forward in the hopes that it might reach someone else\nJohnny son he illustrated and new book by Lin Manuel Miranda called the good morning goodnight little pep talks for me and you thank you very much for speaking to that\nThis is science thank you so much for having me this is such a pleasure [noise]\nYou are listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from PBS with the eugenics crusade American Experience explores the history of the early twentieth century campaign to breed better American race the eugenics crusade Tuesday at nine eastern on PBS\nFrom Elijah crank family owned makers of small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey ... town Kentucky forty seven percent alcohol by volume you Craig promotes responsible drinking\nAnd from visit St Petersburg Clearwater along Florida's Gulf Coast offering artistic draws including St Pete's Dali museum the truly collection and the museum of fine arts more at visit saint Pete Clearwater dot com\nYou're listening to all things considered this afternoon on eighty nine nine ...
