more tourists tries out a new slogan\nNebraska now with indoor plumbing Nebraska middle storm surge no\nNeither of those it's really there's Nebraska honestly it's not for every one after the news\nThe government controlled media has stuck to this narrative that was offered by the crown prince in an interview he gave to Bloomberg News and bad is that journalists came to pick up his papers to get married and then he left\nYou see alternative explanations in social media that he's really in Qatar which is a country seeing as an enemy of the kingdom are maybe his fiance killed him um you see these conspiracy theories to explain the disappearance\nOf course Saudis can search the Web for coverage say in the U.S media but the dissonance is striking this unprecedented golden coverage of the new Saudi Arabia\nHas been replaced by these dark stories of hit squads and brutal torture\nYou know it's interesting listening to you and I'm thinking of the parallels to what ... himself wrote in his final call him the Washington Post\nJust published and he was writing about how in the Arab world they are so subject to false narratives and these conspiracy\nTheories you know he didn't talk about that it's really telling he described the effect of the state run narratives any calls you know people victims of the majority of the population believe it but I\nThink there's something bigger going on here there's this is about the ways Saudis especially young Saudis see the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman will stay with that\nFor a second that we've been talking about how the press is covering this is it possible to gauge how ordinary salad or use a are following this\nYou can see some reactions social media is where you see it shock disbelief fear you know when the crown prince he's known as NBS in the kingdom first came to power he built this cult of personality was young he was dynamic\nAnd young how to use it and that's a huge part of the population\nThey saw him as one of them they based would say we love him he got them and he said he would transferred the country and in some ways he did his rained in the religious police he's permitted women to drive into work he's reopen movie theaters all of that is a really big deal\nThe news out of your abs got all this great coverage it was suddenly cool to be a Saudi but now the country is getting this relentless narrative across the globe so you find Saudis they're angry about it they're afraid you hear you need our oil you need our money why are you attacking us\nThere's no hard evidence they say there's no official proof world so does that\nTranslate into the Saudi public buying the official government narrative of what happened\nI think yes and no I've been covering Saudi Arabia for decades and people I've known for years are now afraid to talk to me um there's fear of getting caught as a dissident getting caught talking to a western journalist\nThere appears to be fear of the unknown when the crown prince came to power he created this tornado of ultra nationalism his face is everywhere in the kingdom so\nFor some they have rallied behind him some of them are changing their Twitter pictures to his oh wow the aid is there\nAny room for descent or for a free press or alternative narrative inside Saudi Arabia because there used to be before the crown prince\nThat is true but this crackdown from the crown prince has been unprecedented and the methods include travel bans house arrest detention without charge even force divorce in in one case there was a bought army you can be attacked on social media you get swarmed on line\nThe other thing is the palaces criminalized dissent with a law that punishes spreading fake news and rumors with a five year jail term and a hefty fine\nEven if

Mara Hi there Hi so start with the issues there's all kinds of things that could be weighing on voters' minds these last three weeks of the the Kavanaugh hearings the\nPresident's a campaign rallies constant campaign rallies developments at the border of crisis with Saudi Arabia [noise]\nCan we say whether any of those seem to be shifting the playing field\nThey are not there might have been a kind of cabinet bump but the most important thing to remember about these last two weeks in the election is that the fundamentals haven't changed much at all the house still looks pretty good for Democrats not sure if it's good enough for them to get the net twenty three pick up seats that they need which they said they need Senate\nMap looks excellent for Republicans that always has that's because there are a lot of Senate Democratic incumbents in very red states where Donald Trump is very popular\nWe know the Democrats are more energized this year Republicans are becoming more energized as they always do in October we're also seeing signs that they we might have a very high turnout mid term election which is pretty rare\nUh people are self reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting we've seen record turnouts in primaries and special election in which the closing argument\nThat both parties are settling on\nWell the closing argument from Republicans who began thinking that the tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular they're closing argument is now warning voters that Democrats will take away the tax cuts\nPut regulations back on the economy wrecked the economy there kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues which do energize their base talking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people\nAnd I'm looking at a fundraising pitch from Mimi Walters Republican congresswoman from California who says we just learned that my socialist pro tax opponent out raised us\nWe can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress Democrats on the other hand have stuck to health care which is the number one issue for voters this year except for their refining a little bit they're now saying Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich created it\nTo close that whole they are going to come and cut your Medicare and Social Security [noise]\nMay I ask you the flip side of a closing argument question which is what's the biggest challenge for each party at this point what's what's keeping Republicans up at night what's keeping Democrats up at night as election day closer than\nRepublicans are worried about the mid west this is the the area of the country where Trump really one Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nThey thought those states would turn red they thought of Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling in the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so they're worried about exciting their base\nIn the industrial heartland a Trump and another problem for Republicans as the Trump kept telling his supporters there is a red wave and how the borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when a president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political

he's a lot more measured and cautious about it the most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to

the regional department store long ago first news\nMeans that legally what powers to see you have to try to block the border\nWell let's go back quite a few years to president Woodrow Wilson ... active duty troops to the border during the Mexican revolution just stop raiders from coming across the border states but today we're talking about families with small children seeking asylum\nTheir longstanding federal laws that give protection to immigrants who qualify as refugees they have the right to cross at legal ports of entry and ask for asylum\nWhether troops could be said to the international bridges to block them as an interesting question the policy come Titus act prevents the military from being used for civilian law enforcement\nIt's interesting that the the most relevant precedent to ah you're citing that you have to go back a hundred years took to Woodrow Wilson right\nLet me let me ask you this the Trump Administration frames all of this in terms of crisis that the situation at the border as a crisis and so appropriate measures are required is the situation at the border right now a crisis\nWill a homeland security spokesperson told me that they're compiling the urine figures right now and she says the numbers of immigrant families arriving at the border will likely break records on a monthly basis\nAnd now it's important to keep this in context Mary Louise because back in two thousand they were arresting one and a half million undocumented immigrants a year so far this year it's been under four hundred thousand but still the Trump Administration is upset and frustrated they continue to blame everything on\nI'm Bruce for allowing what they called catch and release loopholes in the law the d._a. just spokesman told me that the agency is examining all options to secure the border\nAnd when that spokesperson talks about all options family separation is back on the table this policy that was so controversial that the president had to walk back in ... when they tried that earlier this year\nAnd so now homeland security is considering a new sort of watered down form of family separation but also to act as a deterrent to families thinking about crossing a such as those and the caravan right now here's the president on the south lawn of the weekend\nIf they fail the separation in many cases they don't come\nThat of course is the case that the administration made when they rolled out the family separation policy right earlier this year or so what would a watered down version look\nLike well they're talking about something called a binary choice detained families with their children would have two options one that could give their kids up to a government use shelter where the kids would eventually be sponsored by a relative or a foster family who are already here in the U.S\nAn option to they could keep their kids with them in detention indefinitely\nUntil their asylum cases resolved currently of court rulings says the kids can't be locked up with their parents for more than three weeks rate of this would extend fat and immigrant advocates are appalled here's Michelle brane a of the women's refugee commission on a call with reporters yesterday\nLet's be clear the objective of the binary choice policy that the administration is considering inch punish and a church family is from tweaking protection this round two of the administration's handling separation policy\nJohn Burnett ... round two or watered down whatever we want to call this revisiting a family separation at the same challenges are there right I mean for example if they want to ramp up the tension of immigrant families the question of where they would put all these families\nRight and of course the binary choice is still being considered it's not policy yet but if they put it into practice the question is where would they detain all these families currently there are a little over three thousand spots for family members and what are called special family residential centers\nBut you're talking about thousands of these immigrant families that are arrested every week at the southwest border these days\nOf the government doesn't have enough detention beds so for the foreseeable future you'll see the continuation of families\nBeing arrested their process for a few days and then most are released with ankle monitors with their kids to show up for immigration court and that's what's been the devil and the Trump Administration\nAll along NPR's John Burnett reporting thank you John you bet Mary Louise\nInterior secretary Ryan Zinke

planning to replace the independent watchdog leading some of those investigations\nThat department now says that's not happening NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nIt all started with an email from housing secretary Ben Carson telling hut employees that Suzanne Israel tops hundreds assistant secretary for administration was leaving that agency to become acting inspector general at the department of interior\nThis came as a surprise to many in Washington perhaps even to the current acting inspector general Mary candle\nFor one thing inspectors general are appointed by the president and the White House hadn't announced anything and lose ... of the project on government oversight says tough didn't have the experience that would qualify her to be an inspector general\nIndividual that really are they should be non political issues that over say they should have an investigator background that kind of crime and that kind of watched outlaw\nTufts is a former Trump campaign aide who was brought to hug by Carson to replace the staffer who blew the whistle on Carson's plans to use taxpayer dollars to buy a thirty one thousand dollar dining set\n... ethics have also been questioned the inspector general's office has been looking at among other things his redrawing of the boundaries of the grand staircase Escalante national monument in Utah the benefit of Trump ally\nThere are other

a statement to NPR Interior Department spokeswoman Heather swift said Carson's email had false information in it that no decision was ever made to move tough to interior that while she was referred to

trying to piece together what may have happened [noise] based on information available to you have to ask do you believe he is dead\n[noise] you know we we held onto this call him that he filed the day before he entered the consulate [noise] uh in the hopes that we could edited with him as we normally did\nAnd [noise] um we waited and waited and I think the fact that we published today has kind of an acknowledgement to ourselves as well as to the world that we don't have much hope that we're going to be able to edit this one with him or that will ever be getting another call them from him\nFrom everything we know it seems as if he was a victim of a monstrous crime\n[noise] I'm going to ask about the dual role that the Washington Post is playing here there is of course a firewall between the newsroom and reporters an editorial page but you run a firewall that's always there but in this case has it been tricky with post reporters trying to aggressively investigate what happened even as\nYour editorial pages calling on the Trump Administration to do more to investigate what happened\nNow I don't think so I mean you know an editorial side were often taken positions\nI Know but is it different when it's a position on one of\nYou know we are all in the post newsroom dependence side of the new side I think everybody is feeling this very personally\nAnd I think we're all determined to show that you can't do this don't one of ours this can't be a world where our government can lure a journalist to their own diplomatic compound in a foreign country\nAnd then the worst is true dismembered him\nAnd have him disappear\n[laughter] you just spoke there about feeling this personally um how has his disappearance affected your team and affected you\nKnow it's it's very painful a first of all he was well loved by many people [noise] you know if this could happen to gym all it can happen to any journalist and pets to my mind not the kind of world and it was on a limb\nOf the many things that struck me about his last column that you published today one is that he thinks the posed for publishing his work not only in English but in Arabic to reach obviously uh Arabic speaking and reading audience I don't want to ask how common practice that is and why you chose to do that in his case\nBecause we feed our mission as I'm presenting a range of opinions across a wide ideological diverse landscape especially in countries where people can't get it from their own media and Jamal was you know the reason he left Saudi Arabia\nWas she felt she could no longer do it at home and the a lot of people who wanted to express themselves in Saudi Arabia where muzzled or in prison and so he was willing to take some risks to do what they couldn't do\nAnd uh if we can do it in their own language as well as an English all the better\nHe writes in his last column about ah the regime in Saudi Arabia clamping down on on the Internet or do you have any way of tracking how widely read his columns have been either an English or Arabic in his home country in Saudi Arabia\nSo we have certainly seen when we translate our editorial or ... or other piece into Arabic\nWhen you get a big spike in readership from the region [noise] one of the most heartbreaking things about this is that he was a patron he supported a lot of the reforms of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia so she's four\nBut he believed that the best way to accomplish them wants to allow people to debate them and uh to express opinions and I'm In the long run that's the way his country and was going to succeed\nAnd I think we're trying to contribute in that same vein\nFor an high it he's the editorial page editor of the Washington Post College of Jamal ... thank you thank you\n\nFor years there's

midterms Hi Mara Hi there Hi so start with the issues there's all kinds of things that could be weighing on voters' minds these last three weeks of the Kavanaugh hearings the\nPresident's a campaign rallies constant campaign rallies developments at the border of crisis with Saudi Arabia\nCan we say whether any of those seem to be shifting the playing field\nThey are not there might have been a kind of cabinet bump but the most important thing to remember about these last two weeks in the election is that the fundamentals haven't changed much at all the house still looks pretty good for Democrats not sure if it's good enough for them to get the net twenty three pick up seats that they need which they don't they need Senate\nMap looks excellent for Republicans that always has that's because there are a lot of Senate Democratic incumbents in very red states where Donald Trump is very popular\nWe know the Democrats are more energized this year Republicans are becoming more energized as they always do in October we're also seeing signs that they we might have a very high turnout mid term election which is pretty rare\nUh people are self reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting we've seen record turnouts in primaries and special election and what's the closing argument that both parties are settling on\nWell the closing argument from Republicans who began thinking that the tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular they're closing argument is now warning voters that Democrats will take\nThe way the tax cuts put regulations back on the economy wrecked the economy there kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues which do energize their base talking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people\nAnd I'm looking at a fundraising pitch from Mimi Walters Republican congresswoman from California who says we just learned that my socialist pro tax opponent out raised us\nWe can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress Democrats on the other hand have stuck to health care\nWhich is the number one issue for voters this year except for their refining a little bit they're now saying Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich created a huge deficit and to close that whole they are going to come and cut your Medicare and Social Security [noise]\nMay I ask you the flip side of the closing argument question which is what's the biggest challenge for each party at this point what what's keeping Republicans up at night what's keeping Democrats up at night as election day closer than\nRepublicans are worried about the mid west this is the the area of the country where Trump really one Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nThey thought those states would turn red they thought of Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling in the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so\nThey're worried about exciting their base in the industrial heartland a Trump and another problem for Republicans as the Trump kept telling his supporters there's a red wave and have borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when a president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you\nFor all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate

lot more measured and cautious about it than most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and one is good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure
