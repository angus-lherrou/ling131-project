{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "And you have a collective these beetles in the field but where do you find them\nYou say you can find them all over Asia their most famous in Japan but my study sites where in Taiwan and in a few places in Japan including a small island of ...\nSo these are not the Asian longhorn beetle that ravaged the woods of America because as you know now I'm just telling it there's a a a ... when they're trying to weigh female in a kind of a feat of strength contest right [noise]\nSo that's the fascinating part about these songs is that we know that they use\nTheir horns and their horns are important for fighting other males especially fighting other males away from a sack territory a food territory but it seems as if the females don't actually pay any attention to the horns themselves\nSo the males sing instead of uh instead of using their horns with a female courtship at all\nI Am Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC studio\nSo let me get this straight to have these big long horns but to woo the females you know it makes sense that they sing instead and that's when the that's the that's the sound that we are what's here would listen to the sound of the song [noise]\n\nWell Julie and I guess to another beetle that the best love [laughter] sure as what what is it ... it can you decipher anything that's going on in the summers are just something that you know the Beatles know about [noise]\nSo right now we're trying to figure out how the song might be connected to qualities of the male itself like how big is maybe how uh how much energy he has a how well fed he is because in court ships songs across the animal kingdom think about the songbirds in your backyard\nThese songs and and the complexity and their volume and all these other other little details of the songs on selves are used to communicate something about the singer to the receiver and from a male to female that might be saying hey I'm big on bad on\nStrong or something like that and so right now we're in the process of going through the recordings are like you just heard that I've\nTo see if there's any patterns between big and small males how fast they saying a loud they saying stuff like that\nSo you actually have a little beetles recording studio\nI sure do I I made it out of 'em out of some sound absorbent materials some nice foam on the inside and I set up a\nWhole little hole little set up and had a nice little piece of barks for the Beatles to hang out on and a and a video camera and microphone so it was it was a legitimate set up\n[laughter] I'm I'm I'm fascinated about what they are doing to make that sound how's how's that sound produced\nSo I personally think it's something very similar to a cricketer grasshoppers raft and file and so I think that there is\nSort of a a ridge to wash board structure on the abdomen that they're moving against hard part of the wing covers um than\nActual the ... that you see on on the back of debate also I think they're moving that up and down across much like nails on a wash board um another way to insects make squeaking sounds though is by\nForcing air out through holes in the abdomen through which they breed called spirit calls if you've ever seen a hissing cockroach or they don't have a mouse they don't produce that sounded ... mouth structure that's actually from the abdomen so that's another possibility\nSo so the whole ritual goes like well you have these two male big beetles with big mourns and they fight for the\nRight to woo the female the one who wins vantage plays her a song that basically what we're we have going here yeah basically and and what else would you know would you like to know about them if I could give you my sixty four dollar question and I'm [laughter] I'm limited check which I don't have\nWhat would you what would you do what would you construct how would you use it what would you like to know [noise]\nUm I Would like to know and this is what we're trying to figure out in the lab but right now the biggest question is what are females looking for in males and is it different than the competitive traits that we already know are important in the competition side of things\nEven in the Beatles community that's what the question is what our [laughter]\nOur is this is a a they joined dollar question is the age\nOr a question um and so how many beetles have you studied do you think\nOh gosh over the years while and I had our first population a and we caught at least eight hundred nails in one summer it was they were everywhere my uh my old mentor described as like a plague of needles [laughter]\nThere yeah\nI guess that's a good description of a group of buildup leg of beetle

like now also or friday commentators on the week in politics now this news\nYesterday morning he treated quote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful that it's beyond description I'm David can you talk about the help us understand how the leader of our country is leading\nThrough the well he he could've been worse in the last couple of days but it follows I'm three years where he's basically destroyed every norm of common civility and the rules by which we used to do our politics and so we've entered a world where\nA lot of people apparently treat politics as a cult as like the most important form of identity which is asking more of politics and it can bear\nAnd then who think politics is a war to the death between two opposing sides which is also not true politics is a competition between two sides with partial truths and so we've got this a catastrophe ... view of politics which filters down to disturb people\nI'm EJ want to talk to you about this as well obviously we do not know right now the motivations of the suspect um but the kinds of people are talking about who received these packages I'm ed how are you thinking about how this episode has had people talking about divisions in the country well\nFirst of all good for law enforcement for finding Mr Sachs so quickly [noise] ah it shows what's happening on the right side of politics that there were already people saying oh this is a false flag operation by liberals\nAnd whatever else we know about Mr ... van is plastered with pro Trump and anti liberal messages as Ryan said his Twitter feed suggests he's on the Trump side if he's on any side at all but where I disagree with David I think he's tried to generalize too much and saying oh this is all politics there's a fundamental problem here\nWhich is the President Trump's hold on power depends on dividing the nation it's not just that he's capable of being a ... it's a unity is a dire threat to his political standing in you know at three fourteen this morning he tweeted an attack\nOn CNN and then later he sent out a tweet that complaining that this bomb the stuff\nThat's his were his phrase a was hurting the Republicans in the election there's something very specific care about our president and his party because it knows that most of its supporters support President Trump is incapable of talking out against him\nDavid you want to answer that I Know parsing the Twitter feed can take out some time but\nOkay I Want to move on to something else then defense secretary Jim Mattis has authorized the deployment of trips to the U.S Mexico border and this is as this caravan of\n... some thousand migrants is traveling north through Mexico um the response to this is clearly political right now because no legislation is being passed right there is no other kind of movement David what do you see and how we are talking about immigrants migrants in asylum seekers right now is this a permanent shift\nI Do think it as a permanent shift to have us working class Americans why their incomes have stagnated the two answers they give our immigration and trade\nAnd so a lot more people have come to see immigration and not only as a cultural shift but as an economic threat as well I think what strikes me about this particular episode is that again the catastrophic tones for using about it we've had waves of refugees come to our shores throughout our history as late as April\nOr some come ashore some get granted asylum about twenty two percent in this last wave\nAnd we're a big country and we can handle a lot of people are and the idea that this is some existential threat seems to be completely overblown it's an issue that we can deal with a but the way it's being portrayed as some some out of control situation is just out of proportion what's actually\nGoing intimate terms what is the Democratic replied to a a Republican platform that talks about these issues such tried Italy\nI think one of the difficulties here besides the fact that President Trump clearly sort of focus on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration\nOr helps to mobilize his base\nOf the problem here is that there is a total miss characterization of what Democrats stand for they are constantly accused of being for open borders\nAnd when you look at all of the immigration bill saver voted for it they call for an end with support I should say back in the day from some Republicans\nThey all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and it's a Ferrari water or as a human ten days right I mean right but the I think what they are doing what they have to do is say we're not far open borders and\nThis is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics to health care and to the issues that a lot of voters are voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead\nA that's a terrible word about where they stand on healthcare a and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think an integrated many house races to\nDavid the Democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care how are you thinking about that\nYeah I think it's and credibly stupid idea a Donald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy a big change in American identity or he plays on cultural and identity issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats are not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they say we you know we Obamacare it gives you protection for insurance for preexisting conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly cultural and the density critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a decent response in normal times but in a times like this of the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity a big argument against what Trump really stance\nEJ last hard meant it to you\nI think that yeah the voters disagree with tape it that\nThe if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues health care and economics ranked one to or to one uh in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way Democrats do I wrote recently about\nA a a lot of Democrats in a few Republicans defending\nUh being open for example or to refugees and away the Trump Administration has not but the way we come together is to solve problems that's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was a this week and it seems to be working pretty well for her\nAnd that's a JD on at the Washington Post and Brookings

they thought fingerprint was found on one of those packages which has been sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThat we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nRace has sex DNA was identified onto other packages while authorities say say appears to be a political parties and they stress that it's premature to speculate on a possible motive at the White House President Trump praise law enforcement for apprehending the suspect\nThese people have worked so hard and to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate [noise] throughout\nThe week as the investigation proceeded Trump offered mixed messages and NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from the White House to speak more about that hey there Scott coyote so the president has made some very conventional statements during the week condemning what appeared to be politically motivated efforts to strike fear in the hearts of Americans um and we heard more of that today right\nThat's right a ... there were some tough talk from the president's duty so there's no place for political violence in our country he condemned a would appear to be this this uh terrorizing incidents and as he done on a Wednesday or one of four of these packages surface to president made an appeal for national unity\nWe show the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens there is no country like our countries and every day we are showing the world just how truly great we our\nEarlier this week the president urged Americans not to demonize their political opponents or a few so they should settle their differences peacefully at the ballot box this is the kind of thing we expect to hear from President a time like this and yet these kinds of conventional messages get special attention when coming from an unconventional president like Donald Trump\nOr we saw that even this morning when he tweeted about this suspicious packages and he raised suspicions of his own what happened\nThat's where I just hours before sex arrest the president was tweeting about what he called this bomb stuff and he put the word bomb in quotation marks as if to sort of cast\nDoubt on just how seriously he takes this he also complain that the nonstop media attention being paid to the suspected by bombs was taking the focus away from politics and cutting into what he said was Republican momentum ahead of the mid term elections\nYou call that unfortunate suggested that maybe he and his fellow Republicans are the real victims of this episode not the prominent Democrats doing the packages were addressed\nHe also sent a separate tweet in the middle of the night to CNN one of the would be a bombers targets and also other presidents favorite targets he said it's not fair the cable network can criticize him but when he pushes back they say he's not being presidential\nAnd about that election how does the president address all that's left at on the horizon\nWell that's where it might be watching to see because you know here's what the present had to say at the White House this afternoon\nI promise to be a president for all Americans and the amazing results that we've all achieved you but you've you've helped us so much in your communities incredible but the results really speak for themselves\nAt a campaign rally earlier this week the president was self consciously dialing back as partisan rhetoric but you know he's got another rally in North Carolina and I wouldn't be surprised to see him pick the muzzle often delivery more full throated part as a message\nThat's NPR's Scott Horsley at the White House Scott thank you You're welcome\nMean meanwhile President Trump is threatening to close the U.S Mexico border tensions are rising as large numbers of migrant families continue to cross illegally and more are expected as a caravan of migrants from Central America ... north towards the border\nUs border patrol says they're overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi Don hey Ari\nOn TV we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds

I Can't really comment on this investigation obviously um and I think that time is going to a really lay out a motivation settled on governance it's going to be here to Richard Russell resolution and completion of the investigation\nNow since you are at one point a to a terrorist explosive device or analytical team right are you understand sort of what investigators are looking for so how what are the kinds of things they look for especially when packages are found in different states\nWell what would generally happens in a weird ah goes a post blast investigation and often at a post black and goes to ... um you're left with a a debris or that requires a reconstituted a reconstruction of a device that went boom\nI'm fortunate when a scenario where I've ever seen a devices that or did not go boom I'm so there's a ton of evidence tree opportunity\nFor for forensic exploitation which a direct area has indicated what to uh the rest of the individual\nMeaning they can take it apart and try and raise the materials\nAnd exactly in our whole their whole litany of techniques that are years\nAnd it's not just the currents exploitation obviously we live in a world of social media and everybody that I'm going to print there's increased surveillance powers nine over the world um and sadly or we're getting more and more experienced in this over time which makes us better it quickly bringing these cases to a successful resolution\n[noise] um that you talked about as social media people are paying attention to 'em what they are proceeding as his political persuasion so how does the detail like that at weight in this kind of investigation\nWell it's it's difficult to obviously there's a\nConstant winger of individuals of our civil liberties which we all church um it's it's part of my uh my mandate ... respect and support to because ... constitutional liberties of of of all\nI'm domestic terrorism a which we see in in uh in in the United states um you know political terrorism a generally has an element of either or\nA criminal acts that seems to intimidate civilian populations are\nIn ruins government leaders are impact governmental operations and we often see that in the words that are spoken on line [noise] um you know people do uh enjoy that that freedom to to voice their opinions um\nUm attorneys are generally are the best to siders um when that steps over the line the courts are generally the U.S decided on what\nWe heard the FBI Director caution that there could be more packages out there how do investigators deal with that possibility\n[noise] well again I I'm not going to speak to the specifics here but uh increase surveillance or would be certainly one technique and are using a ... the ... the um\nThe vehicle that we already know that these these devices were sent I'm certainly or the mail system um and uh uh for those of us who might be targets um increased vigilance\nUm have you seen anything like this before in your experience\n[noise] uh no I haven't uh this is actually the fact that none of these devices are activated [noise] uh I have not know\nThat the ATF special agent in charge ... on the line from Miami
