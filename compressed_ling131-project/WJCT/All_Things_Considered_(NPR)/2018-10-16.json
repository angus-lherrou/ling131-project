{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WJCT", "content": "So then in two thousand three there's this fire drill and and and it disappears\nRight so the fire drill was supposed to be the perfect cover for this heist a it was a a group of uh of prison guards who worked at that jail decided to uh have a fire drill during the overnight shift\nAnd that's ... pretty much the entire staff to one wing of the jail away from the painting and during that died about Fifteen minute drill three of the guards managed to\nTake the painting down and replace it with a fake and and not very good fake\nSo they mess up the forgery how long did it take until uh people notice the Dolly wasn't any wasn't there anymore\nThat not very long at all the painting was snatched a probably a little after one AM and about maybe six hours later\nOne of the ah guards noticed that something didn't seem right about that painting had another guard look at it with him and they realize that is definitely wasn't fake and from there they alerted the warden who quickly cordoned off the area and an investigator was called to to find out what happened\nRight this investigator his name as my career so he was with New York city and kind of in charge of finding bad internal affairs among the corrections officers in the city and the like uh some suspicion landed on several wardens at Rikers right\nThat's right well not ... but a a system deputy ward and these are basically the highest level you can go and the ranks before you get appointed to being an award in\n'em and er during the graveyard shift the where the there was two of them are a guy named Betty new so in a guy named Michel ... and they were basically the top man in charge that evening so if something was going to happen like the ... are the ones who would have called it so suspicion immediately turned to them\nAnd inspector Caruso starts seeing that they're actually had been a plan a foot for some time it was not an impulsive thing right\nRight so a ultimately for guards are accused of taking the Dolly or one of the guards or an officer named Timothy opinion uh the morning after the highest\nHe uh is immediately wracked with guilt and remorse over what happened\nAnd he decides that he needs to unburden themselves to investigators and tell them what happened and he goes in two days after the highest to the investigators and says\nI was part of this I was instructed by many news though and Michel ... cows are to steal this painting and their plan was to sell it because they believed it was worth quite a lot of money they were planning to sell it on the black market for a million dollars\nAnd Timothy opinion is cut was supposed to be fifty thousand he was essentially supposed to be a one of the lookout man and ultimately he was uh involved and actually taking the painting down and putting up the fake which by the way they\nThey uh they put up the fake what the stapler so again it wasn't terribly low to look at it the replica um so once\nUh my Caruso had a Timothy ... talking to them he wanted the officer to help them even more so they convinced him to wear a wire and later that evening he met up with another one of the guards this time it's the gardening\nGregory socal and they met at a a like a little donut shop in Staten Island Timothy Kenya and Greg socal again talk about what happened and they're both filled with\nRemorse in paranoia that they're going to be caught and unbeknownst to Gregory socal you know Tim ... is wearing a wire so once the conversation's over investigator swoop in and they take Gregory socal into custody\nWho once you've taken into custody also and burns himself about the highs and again points to figure ad Michel ... and Benny news or as the ringleaders so he has or convinces Gregory socal to wear a wire himself\nAnd uh later that evening when socal supposed to start his graveyard shift at the jail he and Betty news though and Michel ... agreed to meet and this talk about all the the heat that's on them about this heist\nAnd they meet in a a a an old locker room underneath the jail where there's like a hissing boiler and there's music playing from a a nearby a weight room for the officers\nAnd they discuss the case depending on who you ask investigators they would say that a Benny news though and Michel ... implicate themselves in those conversations and ... you know talk about about how the heat is on them they talk about how this would never have happened if they use the better replica\nAnd the investigators after they have this they get this recording on the conversation they feel like they have enough to at least\nI'm actually get a search warrant I'm betting news those house rather his ... his mother's house they ransacked it they you know open up filled and fireplaces they look in the ceilings they don't find it\nSo there's some implication from the two thousand three highest that it wasn't the first one that this piece is Delia still on the art last list even today because the one stolen and two thousand three may not have been the original ... what's that about Benny\nWho ah who spoke to me for the article he had his his thoughts about what happened to it he thought that you know\nThe painting had changed hands so many times over the years you know it was it was in the cafeteria than it was it was a boxed up and then it was sent away to a gathering and Virginia than it was boxed up again and kind of forgotten about and then found in a trash bin\nAnd then went to a more than ... office and he believes that somewhere along the way maybe somebody else might have taken up you know when there was a little less chance of being caught and and so many things that the the painting that they actually\nTook from that lobby that jail was and was was already a fake was already a replica of the original one had gone missing long ago\nI got to say your story has enough young young to it that I think Dolly would really appreciate it himself it is it's just a real story\nJames finale wrote the great Rikers Island art highest for Esquire thanks so much for being with us is great story thanks very

Sorkin writes the ... column for the New York times thanks for joining us and you're having me\nWhen I was a little girl I spent hours poring over the Sears catalog I had my eye on a highly hobby often\nAnd aside from the fact that you could make real cakes and what I loved about shopping from the Sears catalog was nobody knew I was a kid I can browse at my own pace no shop assistant ignoring me or talking over my head to my parents\nIt turns out that feeling the ability to shop without being judged resonated in a different more profound way for black Americans in the Jim Crow era Cornell historian Lewis Hyman argues the Sears catalog was radical in its day\nBecause it allowed black Americans to have the same shopping experience as whites he's been pondering that legacy in light of this week's news that tears has filed for bankruptcy professor Hi welcome to all things considered thank you so much for having me\nWhy was the Sears catalog such a game changer for shoppers in the Jim Crow south\nIn the era of Jim Crow race was everything and for black Americans most of whom were rural farmers access to goods on an equal basis as whites in faraway cities at reasonable prices was a godsend and that's what the catalog was\nI mean from a practical point of view of what had happened previously was they would show up and they would be asked to go to the back of the line behind the white customers and if you're shopping back catalog nobody knows what color you are\nNobody knows who you are and in the Arab Jim Crow there was a constant active deference as you're black you had to wait until all the white customers were served you had to wait until the white store owner let you buy whatever you wanted and he may or may not have let you 'cause it was largely on\nCredit [noise] so the Sears catalog appears people could read it at home that could decide what they wanted to order but there were still challenges right meant southern store owners fought back\nOh definitely because if you were an African American and he wanted to shop and some other way you were contesting their power and not just the power of the store owner and the power the landlord but basically the power of white supremacy of Jim Crow itself\nAnd so you had lots of store owners pushing back you know burning catalogs and the street very publicly from Sears catalog and burning Sears catalogs and on fires in the streets all kinds of incentives to destroy these catalogues\n[laughter] so what did you do to keep all their customers are able to order their products\nWell he published instructions in the catalog how to simply give the requirements to the postman so you didn't have to go through the story and a lot of places\nThe post office was also the general store so it was pretty complicated to even get your order submitted to the catalog but they found lots of ways to do this for rural African Americans as well as immigrants people who didn't even speak English they had all kinds of clerks available to take your order and nearly any tongue\nSo your take away is what that this is a reflection on on buying power on retail as as resistant\nYeah I think it's a story of the deep contradiction between Jim Crow and consumer capitalism vacancy in lots of places particularly in this moment in near around Nineteen hundred but also later in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as African Americans acquire more buying power\nThis is part of the demand for civil rights that African Americans could use buses and restaurants in toilets and theaters and everything else that's part of consumer capitalism that this is one of the central writes a very conservative right of American Capitalism\n[noise] who's Hyman he teaches history at Cornell University's School of

and I'm Mary Louise Kelly when hurricane Michael barreled through Florida it also crashed right into the middle of too hotly contested political races Florida is of course a swing state and a critical

Scott a C ... welcome to the program thank you so much as hurricane Michael shaken up these two big races\nIt's had a major effect and the governor's race in the race for the United States Senate because the Democratic candidate for governor who's the mayor of Tallahassee which got hit hard by the storm and the leading Republican candidate for the U.S Senate Rick Scott sitting governor is a it pressed into his other role as commander in chief in an emergency\nTo sort of a help the state recover\nTell me a little bit more about how the candidates have adjusted what they're doing we heard a little bit there from the gubernatorial candidates out on the campaign trail meanwhile Rick Scott who as I mentioned is currently governor he's running to be senator I hear he has turned his campaign over to his wife at least temporarily so that he can focus on cleaning up after the hurricane\nThat's correct Rick Scott has suspended campaigning\nAnd his wife first lady and Scott who is really not had much of a profile as first lady\nHas stepped into the role that's very unusual and I just left Rick Scott in Gadsden county which is the next county west of Tallahassee\nRick Scott though he's not formally campaigning he was eliciting a post for people's concerns about storm problems but everyone wanted to have their picture taken with the governor everyone wanted to shake his hand\nThe point I'm making is you can't ever completely separate governing from campaign\nLet me ask you one practical question early voting in some of the hardest hit parts of Florida is supposed to begin at the end of this month's October twenty sevens are those polling places likely to be up and running\nNot in a place like bay county which is the hardest hit comedy of the bowl and which is by the way the biggest county in the hurricane zone there are scrambling and I've talked to elections supervisors who are asking governor Scott's issue an executive order that would dramatically reduce the number of\nVoting locations so that you have these super of voting centers maybe every five or ten miles people would have to travel further to vote but every one vote would be protected\nHas the hurricane changed the issues that voters say they want to vote on them and I'm thinking of climate change which is not often mentioned first and foremost among things that drive people to the polls but hurricane Michael ... was a part the intensity was impacted by warmer waters which was of course linked to climate change\nI'm skeptical of whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue up throughout this campaign for both governor and US Senate\nDespite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae at sea level rise environmental issues are not polling nearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy\nWhat a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning is getting reinforces to people that without government you have nothing in a in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're great although they're getting from first responders but\nEverywhere you look you see the hand of government funding to give people hope\nSteve ... he's Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times talking about the impact of hurricane\nMichael on

leaders about the disappearance and likely death of journalist ... ...\nCars showed you talk to NPR earlier this year he told my colleague Jackie Northam that he was no fan of the direction crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was taking Saudi Arabia\nHe has no interest input to cause the full you think he can do it alone and he doesn't really any cult that opinion or under you want to share those changes associated with him\nChilling words to hear now from that interview with our international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam and Jackie is with me now to talk more about the crown prince and whether he's a reformer or not he Jackie I'm married I mean\nSo early on a lot of people thought that he was headed down the path toward reform and the and one of the big things that was cited was his decision to allow finally Saudi women to drive people thought about what the promising and there were other moves in a similar vein right\nYeah that's right it was just over a year ago in Saudi Arabia announced it would allow women to drive again that ban was seen as a clear sign of repression and the king them\nUm he also allowed women to go to work again any open movie theaters after about a thirty year ban on that too and all this happened very quickly at the same time his face as they were all over TV and magazines and that\nIs very dynamic compared to the rest of the older Saudi leaders who are known for making a decision very slowly\nHe also tried to open up the economy making Saudi Arabia less dependent on oil\nYes that's right yeah and and that's not going very well at all and here's where we really start to see the ... side of the crown prince he\nWanted to make fundamental changes to the economy and quickly and it's part of that he wanted to fight corruption is a way to bring in foreign investment but it was a way that he did it that's become emblematic of how he operates instead of using laws in court he\nRounded up more than two hundred Saudi businessmen and princes and government ministers\nAnd he held them at the Ritz Carlton hotel for more than three months\nUntil they paid hundreds of millions of dollars to get out\nNow most people would say that's probably not a good way to attract foreign investment in fact probably do just the opposite which it appears to have done I'm thinking also\nSome of his recent moves on the international stage at the war in Yemen where Saudi Arabia has carried out a\nI think largely indiscriminate bombing campaign and then there was the situation with the prime minister of Lebanon remind\nUs what the minister Saad Hariri or he was visiting and Saudi Arabia and he was detained by the crown prince to think about it to a painting of sitting prime minister or well he's visiting your country um that's how I built him a reputation for being reckless in a bowl and many of the analysts that I've talked to over the past few months\nThinks this is because he just doesn't think through or recognized the repercussions of what he's doing 'em and perhaps he doesn't have a great world view and you know he ... he didn't travel abroad very much unlike most other Saturday elites and so perhaps he doesn't have a keen sense of geopolitics\nCircle back to that tape of your interview with ... where he said he doesn't think the crown prince ... we want Senate counter opinion\nIt was a consensus that recent events might be proving that remark prophetic\nWhen in fact actually all over the many months now he's rounded up for religious figures economists activists including those who uh work to get the female driving ban overturned and he doesn't tolerate criticism as you say um and that included from democracy\nYou know he saw the handwriting on the wall he had to leave the country because of that and now with all the robot come here and I had to you know he had to leave Saudi Arabia come here and you know given what's happened his suspected murder\nWill have to wait and see whether the crown princes repressive tendencies are even worse than what people were fearing\nThank you Jacki thanks very with NPR's Jackie Northam\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has developed a close

Mary Louise Kelly when hurricane Michael barreled through Florida it also crashed right into the middle of too hotly contested political races Florida is of course a swing state and the critical one\nAnd candidates vying for the governor's seat and a U.S Senate seat were quick to jump into relief efforts here's Democrat Andrew Gillum he's running for governor and wielding a chainsaw to help clear fallen trees\nRevving up their meanwhile here's his opponent this is Republican Rhonda Santa's on his way to the panhandle to help out fallen tears\nBy the next several weeks for\nThe folks in northwest Florida need you well let me bring in Steve ... he's the Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times he has been out and about today covering current governor Rick Scott at St ... welcome to the program\nThank you so much for hurricane Michael shaken up these two big races\nIt's had a major effect in the governor's race race to the United States Senate because the Democratic candidate for governor who's the mayor of Tallahassee which got hit hard by the storm and the leading Republican candidate for the U.S Senate Rick Scott sitting governor is a it pressed into his other role as commander in chief in an emergency\nJust sort of a help the state recover\nTell me a little bit more about how the candidates have adjusted to what they're doing we heard a little bit there from the gubernatorial candidates out on the campaign trail meanwhile Rick Scott who as I mentioned is currently governor he's running to be senator I\nHear he has turned his campaign over to his wife at least temporarily so that he can focus on cleaning up after the hurricane\nThat's correct Rick Scott has suspended campaigning\nAnd his wife first lady and Scott who is really not had much of a while as first lady has stepped into the role that's very unusual and I just left Rick Scott in Gadsden county which is the next county west of Tallahassee Rick Scott though he's not formally campaigning he was a listening\nThe post for people's concerns about storm problems but everyone wanted to have their picture taken with the governor everyone wanted to shake his hand the point I'm making is you can't ever completely separate governing from campaigning\nLet me ask you one practical question early voting in some of the hardest hit parts of Florida is supposed to begin at the end of this month October twenty sevens are those polling places likely to be up and running\nNot in a place like bay county which is the hardest to copy of the ball and which is by the way the biggest county in the hurricane zone\nThere are scrambling and I've talked to elections supervisors who are asking governors Scott issue an executive order that would dramatically reduce the number of voting locations\nSo that you have these super voting centers maybe every five or ten miles people would have to travel further to vote but every one vote would be protected\nHas the hurricane changed the issues that voters say they want to vote on them and I'm thinking of climate change which is not often mentions first and foremost among things that drive people to the polls that hurricane Michael ... was a part the intensity was impacted by warmer waters which is of course linked to climate change\nI'm skeptical of whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue up throughout this campaign for both governor and US Senate\nOr despite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae and sea level rise environmental issues are not polling nearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy what a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning is it reinforces\nTo people that without government you have nothing in in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're great ... of the ... they're getting from first responders but everywhere you look you see the hand of government uh trying to get people uh you know oh\nSteve ... he's Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times talking about the impact of hurricane Michael on politics in Florida State by
