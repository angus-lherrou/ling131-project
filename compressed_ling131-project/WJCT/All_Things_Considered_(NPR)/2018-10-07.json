T. dot org\n\nBrett Kavanaugh is now on the U.S Supreme Court will ask how the country moved past his divisive confirmation battle some people from the church had reached out to me to say we're really struggling with us for Sunday October ... this is all things considered from NPR News\nMichelle Martin we'll hear how people and Brett Kavanaugh's church has been privately dealing with issues raised by the public debate and\nAfter an officer is killed on duty in South Carolina will talk about violence directed at police the society that does not respected place for it you know it's a don't fail plus activist Reverend William Barber the second on winning a genius grant a gift\nLike this is somebody else sees what you're trying to do what they want to be a part of that word but first this news\nWell thank you and I'm going to start with you and I just want to say that this isn't a referendum on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination because you know Republicans are angry they say that due process is under attack Democrats are angry they say that they feel that this has been manipulated over oh and\nAnd you know not to mention all the gender dynamics So Professor ... I'm going to ask you how seriously do you take the divisions of the moment are the wheels coming off the Democratic project\nWell I think they're very very serious the degree of polarization is the single biggest weakness in American society and in the American political system it's me and said we can't make\nRoutine decisions like appointing Supreme Court justice it also means that it's seeping into society so it's not simply that were disagreeing over\nIt'll policies like abortion it also means that as Americans as as individuals we are increasingly just trusting one another disliking each other on a on a personal basis and\nYou know I think the the hearings demonstrated that we're even perceiving the same events in the same effects in such different ways that they're\nReally doesn't seem to be common ground for having actually a civil discussion and so I think this was a contest\nRation of a process it's been going on for quite a few years though but it's really accelerated I think in the last two\n... and ... I'm going with you because you wrote a piece in the times where you mentioned that people across the west are expressing these concerns is not just in the United states but you also said that understanding history would give us optimism for the future what makes you so sure about that\nOh well if you trade the population the ups and downs of the Democratic project\nReally on both sides of the Atlantic you need to have I think that transatlantic mindset I'm not just saying that because I'm calling you from Prague at if you do that you see that ah that are democracies have come through\nEqual and greater challenge as far more substantial than the ones we face now\nOften there's disagreement there was disagreement about\nUs entry into World War one there was a time disagreement before World War two the Marshall Plan was fully funded until after the Cold War at a gun\nAnd every time we're able to come together it's the genius of the Democratic project chartered it in my new book the last ... looking at that century from here in Prague and so I'm confident that we'll be able to overcome that and perhaps the last play\nOut where where I might take a faction perhaps you professor Fukuyama view is I think it's a symmetrical do not think this is a matter of both sides I Believe that there there was a tremendous breaking\nThe Democratic process in the way that Kavanaugh's nomination was handled and so once we're able to redress those skills as we always are I think we'll get back to the to the more normal turbulent for democracy set of instead of its current extreme version\nI invested or what should we do about this then\nWell I think on the on the uh take the example of the the Kavanaugh nomination um uh but there's so much more and the Trump Administration they the same could be set up we need to acknowledge what the baseline it\nThis was not a normal process I worked when I was in the White House on two Supreme Court nomination\nWe turned over every page of\nJustice Elena Kagan as White House document\nThis White House withheld hundreds of thousands of pages you had an FBI investigation I wrote about what a normal one would have looked like a mission to many of them this was an abnormal and limits hit one who had an extremely unusual unprecedented party's been shipped by the nominee I bought a new\nLook at it but I'm going to ask you we don't have we have limited time so I'm going to ask you briefly to tell us what direction we should go in going forward and then I Want to turn it over to the professor I guess I should we do not\nYet I mean we have to acknowledge what was wrong and it must be\nMade right I Believe there will likely be some regrets in the mid term uh when some more accountability may come to at least want it not both houses of Congress and that read drafts will help heal what's broken\nProfessor for camera you actually belong to a project called better angels which is an effort to bring conservatives and progressive together to reduce polarization used very it's very structured it's very intentional oh how is that going and what do you hope to accomplish this\nIt's one of a lot of grassroots efforts to build civility across the country but I actually think that that by itself is not going to turn on the trip because this is something I think that really needs leadership I I agree with the ambassador that the\nThe blame has not been symmetrical I mean we have a president who instead of trying to actually unite the country around some common interests has done everything is ten or to try to increase the degree of polarization but in a certain sense that means that uh you know there's grounds for optimism because if it is the result of\nThis kind of what I Would regard as really bad leadership it means that somebody with a different agenda you know could actually begin to emphasize you know common national identity things that are Americans actually hold in common and walk us back a little bit from the precipice of us\nSo if there were ... we only have a minute left So Professor ... leadership is not there what should people be doing in the interim\nShould vote I mean I Do think that fundamentally you know a lot of this is a political fight and\nI think that if you're you know I really do think the upcoming election in November is one of the most important in American history because I Do think that that's the ultimate way that Americans have of holding their leaders accountable\nAnd there's going to be big implications drawn depending on the way that this election goes and I think that's really that's the way that in a democracy you exercise your agency and you you know express your democratic we'll\nSo much more to say I'm Sorry we're running out of time but more to come hopefully we'll have this conversation again and we'll talk about how things are proceeding in that way that's professor Francis Fukuyama Stanford his latest book is identity the demand for dignity and the politics of resentment\nAnd former ambassador to the Czech Republic and the current senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution Norman Eisen was
