S. but also the Yemen itself\nI imagine there's also contracts that you can follow tracing Saudis reaching out to lobbyists who they want to reach out to the private sector or for talking ...\nYes so a great example of that is um one of the lobbying groups that Saudi Arabia hired recently was founded by\nHoward ... who was the former chairman of the house armed services committee and one of their other clients is Lockheed Martin which is one of the defense contractors that sells arms to Saudi Arabia fairly regularly\n[noise] I also mentioned think tanks and those donations and grants those are a little bit harder to track explain why\nExactly so the foreign agents registration act is not well enforced by the department of justice they rely on a policy of voluntary compliance and they haven't really clarified what activities and relationships are covered by the law\nThink tanks have traditionally not been required to register under the foreign agents registration act\nThere is a rule in the house that when non governmental witnesses particularly think tank experts are asked to testify they have to file what are known as truth in testimony forms\nIn which they have to disclose any foreign funding received within the last two years as it relates to the subject of the hearing unfortunately have the as it relates to the subject of the hearing\nHas ended up being very narrowly interpreted so for instance a hearing on Iranian backed militias which has a table of experts from think tanks who specializes in Middle Eastern policy and receive millions of dollars from governments like Saudi Arabia Qatar and you're an idea would ever since\nWhich really do have an interest in this topic they'll undisclosed time\nSo this is a long standing practice of countries such as the kingdom of Saudi Arabia providing grants or other donations to big tanks that are influential litter you didn't it thanks so much for stopping by thank you for having me she's an investigator with the project on government oversight\nPresident Trump often criticizes people he has appointed two top jobs and the government lately he's going after someone who sets monetary policy\nThat none of my favorite is the fed because the fed is ranging rage too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing\nThat with Trump attacking Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on the Fox Business Network last night there is a history of tension between the White House and the fed and NPR's Uri Berliner joins us to tell us more about the fiery hello or let's start with what's happening right now why is the president going after the chairman of the Federal Reserve\nWill back in July he said he wasn't happy with the fed rate hikes he suggested that they could interfere with the economic expansion\nAnd then more recently right after the stock market so off you complained again this time a lot more strenuously you said the fed had gone crazy and was out of control\nThen yesterday he dug up even more saying the fed was his biggest threat now the president's been criticized for these attacks including by some former members of the fed you know they say this can create political pressure that interferes with the feds independence but others say you know the fed is fair game and should really be able to defend his policies if they could criticize\nYou ever heard of that tape Trump saying well the fed is independence I'm not going to attack them but they're crazy out of control the biggest threat he's not the first president to attack the Federal Reserve tell us more about the history here\nIt was true or not it hasn't happened up so much recently but you know back when Lyndon Johnson was president he clashed with his fed chairman William McChesney Martin this was ... Johnson was spending a lot on anti poverty programs and the Vietnam War\nMartin was a fiscal conservative and he famously said the Fed's job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting going so they didn't get along and and I think sixty five LBJ someone Martin to his ranch in Texas for a stern talk\nAccording to Martin's oral history LBJ said to him Martin my boys are dying in Vietnam and you won't print the money I Need\nAnd then it was Richard Nixon Nixon pressured fed chairman Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the run up to the Nineteen Seventy two election uh the first President Bush he didn't criticize Alan Greenspan publicly when he was president but years later when he was out of office he said he thought Greenspan cost him his reelection\nSo it sounds like President Trump who's known for violating norms is keeping with a long established an army or is there anything different about these attacks happening now\nHis rhetoric not surprisingly how blood is also it's been very public ah you know I Can't also think of any other prison who said the fed is crazy\nOr what one person is unhappy with the fed is almost always for the same reason presidents won't lower rates easier credit flowing through the economy\nThat can boost growth and not coincidentally my presence more popular but I can also lead to inflation presidents don't often worry about inflation central banks do however that's part of their job so there can be this inherent tension between the fed and the White House that can really pick up during an election year\nRight it's independent but also served kind of of the pleasure of the president is there any chance of Jerome Powell getting fired by President Trump\nThere is no indication of that the fed is supposed to be protected from politics and politicians Donald Trump has acknowledged that he's the one who appointed Powell and that the fed is independent but the fed is really seem to have gotten the fed is really seemed to have gotten under your skin is NPR's Uri Berliner thanks for joining us today You're welcome [noise]\nIt's all things considered from NPR News\n[noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered this afternoon on eighty nine nine couple you KCET in Jacksonville, Florida it's Eighteen minutes now past four o'clock European leaders are in Brussels trying to reach an agreement on Brexit but it doesn't look good\nMy hope was today we will have already some phone creed solution on the table but it looks like it will not be a deal to the\nLatest on where things stand and what happened at Britain leave the EU without a deal that's coming up and Fifteen minutes here on eighty nine nine\nMayo Clinic where cancer specialist work together to translate new developments in cancer treatment into comprehensive individualized patient care more at ... dot org slash Florida\nComcast Business providing the gigs speed network that gets business done Comcast Business beyond fast more Comcast Business dot com\n... is not simply a place for care knew Morse is a way of caring for children our promise means will do whatever is in our power to help children grow up healthy regardless of ability to pay you can help new Moore's dot org slash our problems\nAre forecast calls for most like cloudy skies overnight a low around Seventy three decrease\nWeather's going to be changing scattered showers and thunder storms tomorrow highs only in the upper seventies right now in Jacksonville still pretty Warren Buffett cloudy skies Ninety degrees down town for twenty\n[noise]\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from his Cox insurance providing customized insurance for small and medium businesses\nPresident Trump says he's not giving cover at all to the Saudis while affirming country's critical partnership with the U.S\nThey are ... we have other worries that allies in the middle east but if you look in Saudi Arabia they're an ally and there was tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment but other things\nTrump says he's waiting for the results of an investigation from the secretary of state including possible audio and video from Turkish authorities who say the journalist was murdered and solve the consulate in Istanbul\nToday is the first day of early voting in Tennessee where folks will be selecting a governor and a U.S senator Sergio Martinez both Trump of member station WBUR deal and tells us six or ... cents Democrats see the race as one of their best chances to flip a Senate\nRepublican Marsha Blackburn a democratic Phil Bredesen or running for an open seat in a close race that has been classified us the most expensive one in the history of this they\nWouldn't do Bolton ...

leaders on progress that negotiators made so far\nAnd then the other twenty seven leaders met over dinner without Mrs Maine to decide what to do next NPR Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Brussels watching the ... and goings at the summit Shariah Hi Mary Louise\nLet me come straight to the basic question which is whether or not they're going to reach a deal before the u._k. scheduled to depart the you this coming march where does that stand well\nThat's the question that nobody seems to be able to answer tonight uh everyone's trying to put on a optimistic face chance or ... tonight said there Ninety percent of the way they're Merkel\nOf Germany go I'm wrecked um and ah but the problem is that there is a key sticking point about where to basically put the border between the u._k. and the email you have to have a hard border with customs and passport control and that's what I think the border that they are that they don't want is between Northern Ireland\nAnd uh Ireland Ireland being part of the EU and Northern Ireland being part of the u._k.\nAnd so they can't agree though exactly where to put it elsewhere who would run that border that sort of thing and that's what's holding everything up\nAnd it's really frustrating because everybody felt that this week was the week they had to come to a deal in order to get it and acted before brags that happens on march twenty ninth of next year slow that prime minister Peter ... captured the dire or our mood as it were the best\nThing he's usually an optimistic person but not today\nMy hope was with us today we will have already some\nPhone pretty the solution on the table but it looks like it will not be a deal today\nBut he and other leaders are saying that they're keeping an open mind\nWhat about Theresa May the British prime minister she's still sounding optimistic\nI well I Would say she's the cheerleader today I mean she says that the EU case position is still on the table she feels that they're getting close a but she wouldn't say whether she's presenting any new proposals which the e council president Donald Tusk and other leaders want\nThe teams if he was very hard in order to ensure that we do dress seized issues of what we've seen is that we've sold most of the issues in withdrawal agreement I Believe in the old FISA she will not at the time to make you tough\nShe also wouldn't say or what she thought about extending the transition period the u._k. would have to leave the EU which is something that some leaders including the Irish prime minister we're talking about\nElaborate on that um and what would that mean to extend the transition period after Britain leaves the you well right\nNow the agreement is more or less that ah when the u._k. leaves on the twenty ninth of march\nNext year that basically until the thirty first of December the following year in other ways twenty twenty or economic and trade deals between the you can email would remain unchanged and now they're talking about extending yet another full year in order to increase the chance of negotiating a full treaty\nAnd meanwhile hanging over all this is just the specter\nOf it and Britain might leave the EU without a deal might just crush out\nYeah and that's something that everyone is is quite worried about it besides the fact you'd have snarled borders in price hikes for good or if it will be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example where analysts say that the cost cutting feed a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars if there is a hard to break that as it were\nA hundred and Fifteen billion while NPR ... hard enough and reporting from Brussels ... You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for the British and European economies and for the U.S George Parker has written about this he's a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program ...\nIf there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very bad don't you and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts to the border so you would have a immediate you'd have checks on old goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't help at the moment that will quickly to huge queues to the pool it's coming into person\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed down\nOn the bank of England is full cost this could be actually a fairy tale sickened damaging up say for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning going on the case in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool\nThat will be quite bad and the pursuit calling me we'll take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you introduce border checks the place where there are ... you can have she's running ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile

I'm working with with\nThese new officers get five weeks of training but just the four hours ... teachers on how to deal with women prisoners\nThe same where those treat everyone the same for the earth and said why is there you know I'm working with women\nThe country some Fifteen states are teaching new ways of treating women prisoners gender response of corrections is built around the understanding that women prisoners are different\nThey're less likely to come to prison for violent crimes in prison they're less likely than men to be violent but the discipline system in prison is set up to control violent men so those rules country women more harshly more unfairly\nIt's an insight that came out of decades of academic research from feminist historians sociologist another academics from women consultants who specializes in prisons and from that minority of women who made a career in corrections like Maggie Burke\nShe was the warden of a women's prison in Illinois but she too started as a corrections officer at a men's prison\nYou do a firearms your very first week of training and then that screens everybody out if you can't pass with a weapon than you can't do the job and and I'm going to tell you that you know twenty nine years in the department and I've never had to usually on\nThe second thing she says corrections officers learn how to use handcuffs\nAnd so that kind of set people up with an expectation that the work we're doing is physical as aggressive as learn orders era military but the work we're doing is talking to people who are changing lives and you don't do that but I barking orders you don't do that by forcing people to do something\nAbout Seventy five Ninety percent of women in prison had been victims of sexual or physical violence when a corrections officer especially if it's a man yells or parks and order the woman's reaction is often defensive she might just shut down or she might yell back and back can result in a ticket she gets disciplined\nTypically when you tell them in to do something a male and he he's either going to do it or is that he's not gonna lip and he's not going to talk that there isn't a whole lot of emotion to it broke worked in men's and women's prisons whereas with women emotion is in their\nThis sounds like a generalization but we heard it over and over from experts on women's prisons\nAnd she's just like go ahead write me a ticket it just feels a fire and so then it's an emotional ticket\nPrison guards are trained to keep it made under control women in our society in general are expected to be compliant and if they push back which in prison they do more than men officers use that tool they have ... control they hand out punishment and now\nShe's got influence because she's talking back at me and maybe she said something that I can perceive us threatening and I'm going to write you know that she threatened me\nNPR on the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states\nWe estimated rates of punishment for men and women and our numbers show that women typically get disciplined at higher rates for the more minor violations of prison rules\nOften uh twice or three times the rate for men for those smaller things like disobeying a corrections officer or cursing or talking back who send the Gillum as a prisoner of the I Will correctional institution for women serving time for robbery\nShe remembers when not that long ago she'd get into a lot of trouble for talking back\nOnce a corrections officer made an announcement on the overhead speaker for the women to be quiet but ... says she was on another part of the cell block and didn't hear it\nWhile I was coming from upstairs and I have to end up and I said what was that and he said hey I said no talk and whatever and now that we don't have to yeah and I let him down here and he made a comment on our site well this is America and see what else [laughter] and he wrote me up for it felt my response that smart at a ... and I gotta a major report\nTypically when women prisoners violate rules even a lesser violation that can lose privileges like getting visits are using the phone they can go to solitary confinement or have\nThese added to their time in prison now the prison in Iowa trains officers that if it's not a security issue that some of those things go de escalate situations that we the tickets because officers\nThe new ones that I notice they they talk to us more they interact more the ax is how we doing not trying to be our friend let realized that where people are that we've made mistakes and get ourselves here you know they they're kinder\nAnd ... says that changing the way corrections officers responded to her help premature\nShe's been taking college classes and once you leave prison next year she wants to complete her degree and get a job counseling people recovering from substance abuse as states start implementing these new ways of treating women there is a small amount of research that shows women like who send the Gillum then do better when they leave prison\nSo are there lessons in this women's reform to make prison were better for men to Becky Nate thanks so women lead the way yes she's a pioneer of gender response of corrections she started the national resource center on just a symbol women\nMen probably have trauma in their lives and then probably been victimized in their lives men have lots of discipline issues\nAnd men make up Ninety three percent of people in prison\nSo maybe we will find some opportunities to take the work we know about trauma and give it a male spin and have that be very helpful to them as well\nJust like women's prisons learned from studying what specific about the trauma of women may says men's prisons can learn by studying what specific about the lives of men she says there's already an example\nMore men's prisons are trimming corrections officers how to de escalate conflict to figure out what it is about men that causes them to ACT UP and to use that gender based knowledge to avoid situations that we'd be getting disciplined for violating prison

Fifteen ... airplanes to to carry out airstrikes the United states supplies the weapons the maintenance the training if the U.S threatened in any way to to limit that cooperation that would severely restrict the way that the Saudis could carry out that that war there'd been high civilian casualties\nAnd that's something the U.S could press the Saudis on if they so chose the other is this boycott of Qatar Saudi Arabia's neighbor well Qatar's of very wealthy country it's also a close us ally a major us airbase there um and and so that\nUh is something the U.S could cause stress and say hey play nice with Qatar we want these are all we're both were all in this together um let's let's end that boycott\nOut Saudi Arabia reacting to the possibility of the sanctions what what their response likely be\nWell they they came out this week and said that they would respond with greater action if if some sorts of the punitive measures are imposed on them um they could always pump less oil and try to drive up prices of of it goes very much against their the way they've always done business\nUm interesting factoid or the Energy Department announced just last month the U.S has surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's leading oil producer about eleven billion million barrels per day\nSo ... is just not as important as it is it used to be a but this uh this ... is a reminder that relations are often strain the thing you often hear when talking about the U.S in Saudi Saudi Arabia's these are countries that share\nThat share interests not values\nNPR's Greg Myre we thank you thank you\nYesterday President Trump compared the ... case to the debate over Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh he said both are cases of quote guilty until proven innocent\nDuring the

doesn't cast a shadow over the high court\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions [noise]\nBut what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is\nHow it must be very different\nThe chief justice gave that audience at the University of Minnesota law school a defective civics lesson about the role of the Supreme Court in American democracy\nOur role is very clear\nWe are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states\nAnd ensure that the political branches act within them\nThat job obviously requires\nIndependence from the political branches\nThe story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence\nRoberts highlighted some of the difficult decision to the court made that ran contrary to popular political opinions of the day and Roberts said when the court has made mistakes it is because the court gave in to political pressure for example the Korematsu ruling that upheld internment of Japanese Americans during World War\nTwo he shared a tradition the justices have one that's designed to reinforce their shared commitment to working together despite ideological differences\nBefore we go on to the bench to hear argument in the case and before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand it's a small thing perhaps but it is they repeated reminder\nAs our newest colleagues put it we do not sit on opposite sides of an ...\nWe do not serve one party or one interest we serve one nation\nAnd I

Mary Louise Kelly last night that to US Senate candidates from Texas debated in San Antonio three weeks before election day it was an important opportunity for democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke an incumbent Republican Ted Cruz to make their cases to voters\nThat debate like the race was downright nasty as NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports\nSenator Ted Cruz is reelection campaign has not been shy about attacking his opponent congressman Beto O'Rourke on TV\nI'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message men are more ... more extreme than even once you didn't\nWant to attack ad which eventually seemed to backfire Cruz's campaign misleading edited video tape to make it appear as if all work said he supported flag burning which he did not say\nFederal organizations are too extreme for them to do list for Jackson\nUntil now Beto O'Rourke has declined to participate in negative campaigning but with the poll showing cruise with anywhere from six to nine point lead the congressman relented and has gone on the attack\nRepublicans and Democrats alike know that we've got to lead on immigration reform and yet Ted Cruz is the only senator to vote against moving forward with that conversation invalid and deport every single dream\nLast night of their debate in San Antonio this trend continues cruise painting O'Rourke is a dangerous extremist\nIt didn't work in energy if you work in oil and gas congressman O'Rourke record on this is extreme he didn't just vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil he's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking\nBut unlike their first debate last night O'Rourke hit back\nThis is what you can expect over the course of this to be a Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you is going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or ever take is dishonest why the president called ... and it's why the nickname stuff because it's true\nAlthough cruise would force a laugh when a work attacked him his face revealed is true emotions and the senator didn't like it but the debate in San Antonio was more than just battle it was substantive to\nCruise has the numbers on his side there are hundreds of thousands more Republican voters in Texas the Democrats as a result Cruz spoke mostly to his base\nThe state of Texas is booming we got right now the lowest unemployment enforced\nYou know ... years Texas is seeing the benefits\nOf low taxes and low regulations and congressman O'Rourke position is always always always in favor of higher taxes\nCruise generally play to Republican fears of what would happen if Democrats gained any power or work tended to speak the voters better angels\nWhether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now the partisanship the pettiness the dishonesty that defines so much of a national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration\nAlthough workers running way ahead of other Texas state wide Democrats close still gets you know cigar\nI think that a very good democratic candidate running against a flawed Republican candidate has a chance to break through that's why ... came up so strong on\nCruise ... who's a professor of political science at Southern

complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications yeah I
