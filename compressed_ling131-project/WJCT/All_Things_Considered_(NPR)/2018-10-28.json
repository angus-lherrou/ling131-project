last um November two thousand and Seventeen my father has had a debilitating issue which ... share a lot of muscle now\nA lot of weight and we have been going through its primary care doctor thing to have a ... because they thought that he has\nSome type of cancer we did not know that all the blood markers came that fight now he um let that a conflict that he had taken a hollow Jackie I'm\nOn that and they said you know without any testing\nOf course after many appointments with a doctor and she looked at it and they said you know I think you have some type of auto disorder because you know with the amount of weight you often maybe not even able to get out of the tub and how he almost had to call rescue on them\nWow it get it out and then how old is your dad he is sixty four years old ...\nAnd what's his height what's his weight\nHe weighed about two hundred and ten pounds and now he weighs one sixty nine\nWow that's a that's a huge that's a huge wait for someone that age any other symptoms besides a weight loss he's he he said he's seen him metallic just which he metallic just are often oncologist and cancer specialists great and they think it may be an auto immune disease\nRight so without we don't we haven't seen another doctor that he prescribed him I had no sound\nSo but he doesn't have a diagnosis\nHe said they should be able to colleges to write my colleges that appointment yet but we still don't know that within the\nCourse that has um for having prescribing medicine he first started steroids and do steroids has now gave him a little bit of ability to do what he needs to be on the age now out of the bed where he was lying for the last eight months\nNow have way\nSo we don't really know what's going on with them you know the ... another doctor said we're kind of stumbled and when his income he's not working the ad that retired now he has forced to retire hired you to have all of the resources financially wide it got to doctors and doctors not figure out what's wrong with them\nThat we're trying to write for grasping at straws here\nWell you know clear by the warehouses insurance\nWhile he had to cover now because of its job right\nAnd so we're paying a very healthy part about a pocket that also has a high deductible\nToo so we'll have a\nThe the first issue I mean first of all your you know within a year you want to use you want to do it all\nWithin one year or so you said that ... that's the dumb and stupidity of of you know American medicine is the director book goes for the calendar year and then you start to a different deductible I won't get into the politics of that but that's but that's a problem with him you do not have a diagnosis for him\nI always recommend you got to go to a secondary institution I mean it's gone from two hundred\nIn past one hundred and sixty nine pounds he's gonna weakness he stopped eating something is rotten in Denmark as Shakespeare would say there's something going on with him and you've got to get another opinion\nClearly the metallic just on colleges that you're going to ... doesn't have an idea of what it is and just to say I'm going to put you on President sound and see if you gain weight and then oh you don't use pride in his own\nAs an end all be all let's just put 'em on premise of and you have to have a reason to do that and you don't have a diagnosis you have to have a secondary center and frankly the sooner you do it the better he has lost a ton of weight\nAnd he's not working and he's only in his sixties and something going on here and the real question is\nAs you would expect is there a cancer looking here that's actually doing it that they just haven't picked up and sometimes there is a cancer they don't pick it up the usual ways and they

that this has residents ... you know far beyond this neighborhood certainly far beyond even the city and I just I Wonder\nI don't really have a really good question for you I just wonder if there's something to do I do that or is this something that I think\nThere's two takeaways that number one is there are levels of evil or evil manifests itself in a multiple homicide and certainly seeing a loving people's lives being taken from them is definitely something that is\nA felt strongly by a lot of people but it also is when those people are being murdered simply because of the way that they pray and then it takes on a different level\nWhen you pray on the elderly or you prey upon children and then it takes another level when you go into a place that is sacred to those people and a place that is considered\nSafe haven becomes a mass grave yard and all those different levels of evil\nOr open there is a natural reaction for people to want to reach out and to try to help other people but there is a secondary level as well because all of the rhetoric and the talk about our different all the\nNotion of how we should not ... or ... people are different in Americans are different\nThere's an underlying tone around the world of an office in off\n... at this level of hatred ... and that's Mayor Bill potato of Pittsburgh Mr ... thank you so much for talking to thanks for Britain\nAnd now

gathering that included to service a congregation and getting everybody was saying hubs really matter at this time\nAnd then people who you know are constantly sending us text and email us and that

by NPR's Sarah McCammon who was in a squirrel hill neighborhood today close to the tree of life synagogue fair thanks so much for\nIn a place like a synagogue or a church or a mosque in places that are sacred places of worship that someone could commit such a a an abhorrent um disgusting crime um you know our organization celebrate mercy teaches about\nThe the life and the character of the prophet Mohammad 'em and many of his teaching as hum\nTell us that we should try to respond to evil with good you know when someone there's a verse in the ... on that says repel evil with that which is better and we thought that you know what better way to embody the prophet Mohammad teachings than to try to start a campaign\nThat will help 'em reach out first and foremost as fellow human beings but also to you know our Abraham Mick cousins or from the Jewish community um and try to help out and in some way I'm through this horrific ordeal\nHe original goal was twenty five thousand dollars now that you've so ... feet it it's so quickly now you bumped it up to Seventy five thousand does that say something to you\nI think it says a lot I think it says that there's a lot more good inhumanity than there is a bad and evil and hatred um we've had to increase the goal now twice and a lot of the donors are not even Muslim I mean we we said clearly on the crowd funding page that\nAlthough this is a Muslim led campaign we welcome people of all faiths or even no faith\nBut the fact that this is a Muslim led campaign is there some message that you would hope to impart with that\nYeah one particular story from the profits life inspired it and it is like there was a time when the prophet Mohammed was a sitting down with some of his disciples and he noticed a Jewish a funeral procession\nPassing by at a distance and he immediately stood up when he saw that Jewish funeral and paid his respects his disciples asked him why are you standing up um this is not a Muslim funerals it's only a Jewish funeral why are you standing\nHis response was so beautiful he said\nIs it not a human soul is it not a human soul and that that that story you know when I when I first saw the desecration at Jewish cemeteries last year\nAnd now with what happened at the synagogue um it reminded me of that story from the prophet Mohammad life and that and in really inspired me to want to start\nSomething to want to help out and really to put aside I mean if you look historically Jewish and Muslim communities in America have not worked that closely together I mean often politics gets in the way things that are happening overseas often gets in the way\nBut what's most important is our our shared humanity and we want it to reach out as human beings to help out\nAnd do you have a plan for the funds now that you have exceeded even your own expectations what do you hope to do with the friends that you were raising\nWell we want to do is go to any of the affected families to say you know any costs that you have whether they are deductibles for medical treatment whether you know you've had to have relatives come in from out of town or you know book hotels to to be near you

scrambling to find a way just to remain active\nWhat what have authorities been saying about how this attack which is not the first mass shooting we've been seeing but sadly the latest how how was it
