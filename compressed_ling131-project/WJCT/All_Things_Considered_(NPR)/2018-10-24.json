questions you have about and what's going on here\n[noise] well the big question of course is what is this a who did it and what are they tried to accomplish [noise] you know the selection of target certainly push us in the direction of sucking this might be some form of right wing extremism\nBut we can't rule out that you know it's simply somebody's mental ill or very far into possibility but somebody was trying to create the impression\nThat it was a right wing extremism we're seeing a lot of arguments on social media suggesting some kind of false flag like that and and both of those arguments are being made in bad faith but until we have suspect we really won't know for sure\nWe are living through times where politicians and journalists are being demonized is this kind of attack inevitable [noise]\nWell it's certainly not surprising and uh the rhetoric\nIn this country from mainstream politicians is extraordinarily rough uh is is the conscious way you can say it and violence is probably more accurate way said in addition you have a very large rightwing extremist movement that is flowering online and creates a lot of heat\nAnd that he can occasionally set somewhat off the person who did this may or may not have been influenced by that we're at the mercy of investigations until we really know short but it wouldn't surprise me at all but go the mainstream and the extreme

been three weeks and a day since dissident Saudi journalist ... went missing it's been five days since ... death was announced on Saudi state TV\nThroughout that time the Trump administration's position on the killing of ... and Saudi Arabia the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nHas been evolving the president has condemned the killing that still has not condemned the Saudi crown prince or said whether he believes NBS as he's referred to played a role one Republican senator who has been a vocal critic of the Saudi kingdom policies and the\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself is Indiana senator Todd Young it's called the crown prince impulsive and reckless and says the U.S should send the Saudi leader a message senator young welcome thanks for having me also so what is the message the U.S should send to Saudi Arabia right now\n[noise] um it's crystal clear Americans won't stand for this sort of behavior we've seen in recent weeks and I would say uh over the last couple of years of the behavior coming from\nThe Saudi Government and more specifically from the Saudi heir apparent a prince Mohammed is contrary to our values our international laws in our national security interests\nHasn't been a mistake for President Trump to put so much trust Indian Solomon's pledged to reform its country then\nLook I think it's really important that we work with security partners in the middle east there aren't many options to choose from a but we do have leverage as a country to use against the Saudis to bring them in a better behavior so that they're not repeatedly killing civilians\nThrough airstrikes using our weapons in our fuel is they've been doing for the last couple of years in Yemen so they're not murdering journalists are like Indiana State a graduate a ... in the Washington Post journalist\nSo these are the sorts of things that we need to not only highlight but we need to begin holding\nThe government in Riyadh to account on on account of these actions\nAnd on holding Riyadh accountable some of your colleagues in Congress have been calling for a regime change in Saudi Arabia for the crown prince to be replaced do you agree that that would be a good step\nWill look we're still confirming certain details with respect to a this most recent tragedy\nIn the interim I've been encouraged that the administration is revoking the visas of individuals' we already know had been involved in this ... situation I'm but I'm not prepared to rule anything out\nUh I I think we should suspend all arms sales until we know more and we should most certainly should stop refueling Saudi coalition\nThe craft or engage in this sort of atrocities I just referenced in the country of Yemen\nRight you mentioned that you would like to see Saudi arms the Saudi arms deal with the U.S get ripped up the President Trump has talked a lot recently about all the jobs that would be lost if this White House tore up that arms deal with Saudi Arabia do you share the president's concerns about jobs being lost\n[noise] look I think that the number of jobs that you can see ... levy loss from this ah or frankly fairly minor and I I I don't see that as a major consideration I see this instead is a matter of upholding our values and um let's not forget our national security interests here\nThe country of Yemen has been destabilized by Saudi action\nThat country happens to be the headquarters of al ... in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous al ... affiliate out there so um it's essential\nWe've talked about what Congress could possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the president do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake of democracy oh geez that well\nI think uh the president's message I gather more information it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact he condemn the ... death is the worst cover up ever\nThat's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner rumors\nBut should President Trump had been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national\nSecurity partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever and and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of the United states\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on does that concern you\nYou know we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing that the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners they provide as valuable intelligence\nBut I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined as the Saudis ah Deceive Us and as they engage in a violation of our fundamental values as strongly appear to have done in this instance in the ...\nWhat countries are coming from\nShelbyville has seen a big influx of immigrants in the last Twenty years voters like ...

after he took office and in recent years Tennessee has passed some of the toughest anti immigrant laws in the country at a recent debate in Knoxville reticent said he's a border hawk even if he doesn't agree with President Trump\nI Believe very strongly in controlling our borders but I think there are much better ways of doing it and building a wall actually wall is sort of political theater\nBut Marsha Blackburn clearly sides with the president\nLet me tell you something Tennessee and want to see that wall built because open border policy should make every town a border town in every state a border state\nBlackburn has been a long time immigration hawk representing Tennessee in the house her critics say Blackburn and Trump are trying to exploit fears about immigrants who are no more likely to commit crimes than anyone else\nCertainly we think candidates like Trump saw what worked here in Tennessee that you can make people think innovation has something to be feared and

purpose of it\nBut this year things his own generation the children of immigrants they get it\nThat's why I feel hopeful is that our generation our younger generations are going to understand that and

I feel confident that they'll be able to link these devices but then the real work will be tenuous link it back to a person or persons are known and I know they're really looking at how are these delivered\nAnd the fact that none of these devices actually exploded that that fact does help investigators right when the devices are still intact and might still retain fingerprints for example\nAbsolutely and that's why the um the first responders are are taking so much time to render these devices safe\nWithout destroying the evidence it's not like they're going to put another an explosive device next to it and blow it to smithereens they have techniques used to preserve evidence this will be important as the investigation unfolds but right now\nThere are devices that could be in the mail not yet a delivered we saw this in central Texas recently were devices were going overtime\nAlright that's David ... former special agent for the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives thank you very much for coming in today\nRepublicans and Democrats don't agree on much these days but they had all felt the pain of the nation's opioid epidemic\nLast year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose\nOpioids were responsible for about two thirds of those stats and the White House today President Trump signed legislation that will allow lawmakers from both parties to say they are taking steps to address the problem NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nThe opioid bill was passed by both the house and Senate with near unanimous approval level of bipartisan support that Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio says is unusual and today is highly polarized political climate\nI guess maybe because the severity of the crisis and particularly in states like mine uh people are willing to work together and joined hands and figure out how to solve it and forget the politics\nDemocratic senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire agrees the opioid crisis cuts a wide and deadly swab from rural areas to big cities and polls show it's the rare issue that voters in both parties are alarmed by\nWe are losing over a hundred people a day in the United states of America to this epidemic you can go anywhere in the country and talked all about the impact it had on them this is impacting people in all walks of life in all the different ways\nThe opioid built signed by the President's Day aims to address the problem in different ways targeting both supply and demand President Trump signed the bill with some fanfare in the White House ... almost exactly a year after he declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency\nTogether and we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible\nTerrible problem lots of politicians are claiming credit after the bill ... as the measure incorporates lots of different ideas efforts to interdict drugs at the border for example and increase support for drug users seeking treatment\nWhat the bill doesn't include is a whole lot of new money to fight the problem hasn't says lawmakers have approved some six billion dollars to combat opioid addiction over the next couple of years\nBut experts in the field tell us that is not nearly enough we have to treat this as a starting point we have a lot more work to do\nPortman wants to see more effort to address over prescribing opioids knowing that many addicts start out with a legitimate need for pain pills but he has despair also plays a role\nFor the answer to this is to get people who are in places like small town Ohio of rural Appalachian more opportunities that is I think one of the antidote to the drug issue more broadly\nHealth secretary Alex days are said this week there are some encouraging signs that the epidemic may be leveling off or at least not growing as rapidly as it once was\nBut drug addiction remains an elusive and evolving problem overdose deaths from heroin and prescription drugs may be near their peak but Portman says methamphetamine is regaining a foot hold and cocaine is making a comeback as well\nYou know it's a societal issue we have America has a bigger drug problem at other countries are not just opioids away by far lead the world and we need to focus on that broader issue\nFor now though today's bill signing gives members of Congress something they can point to when confronted with the pain of the drug epidemic back home\nScott Horsley NPR News the White House\nYou're listening to all things

Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman made his first public comments today on the killing of journalists Jamal ... as\nLimited to the gym is are these\nSpeaking at a conference in Riyadh the crown prince said it was painful to all Saudi citizens he called the killing a heinous crime the killing prompted many western CEOs canceled their plans to attend this high profile gathering U.S Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin canceled his appearance but\nMany of us business executives did show up and to find out more about what had happened at this conference we reached New York times reporter Alan Rapaport he's in Riyadh welcome thanks for having me\nSo we're talking about what this conferences for the Saudis want the global companies to invest their money in the king and that's the basic objective right\nExactly it's called the future investment initiative and it's the second year that they've done it has become known sort of colloquially as the ... in the desert a conference and drawing about three thousand people wow this week\nOr wow world and in part of the deal is the Saudis want to diversify their economy so they're not as reliant on oil I imagine\nExactly so there's lots of panels going on at the conference where they talk about capital markets investing technology and you know efforts to make Saudi Arabia hub for these kinds of industries come here and set up shop\nNow this year of course the killing of democracy ... cast a shadow over the conference today the crown prince directly confronted the issue in his comments what what did you make of his remarks today\nIt was quite interesting everybody was kind of wondering first of all whether or not he would speak or not and they did whether or not he would address the situation and ah he did address it head on a he did not take any responsibility personally for it\nWhich was interesting but he called it a heinous act and he did promise springs whoever did it to justice so I think that was his attempt to try and concerns a among people from all around the world who think that this is sort of part of the Saudi culture to violate human rights in this way\nAnd how was the audience reacting as the crown prince was speaking today\nWas a very positive you know I'm sort of a bully in the audience in favor of the crown prince he got standing ovations um after he uh discuss the situation as well as when he was talking about the Saudi economy and how you know he wanted to lead the charge to make it an economic powerhouse\nYou mentioned that it was a very supportive audience I I Want to talk about what American companies did show up and who did you see there\nThere was a broad range of executives from all different kinds of companies the big names from my jeep marking and Goldman Sachs we're not there are some of the benefits and lower level executives\nBut I think some people were definitely shy about being there they were in many cases concealing the names of their name to find their ties are keeping their jackets buttoned up which you might not you in Saudi Arabia were pretty hot\nWhere people willing to talk about why they did show up what they hope to get out of the conference\nYeah somewhere I mean there was definitely a sense a people that I spoke to\nBut you know this is an important business opportunity and important investing opportunity and I didn't want us our relations with the Saudis I think some people felt that you know their attendance if they didn't show up wouldn't necessarily be notice or make a statement so they felt like they were going to go\nAnd see what happened anyway and there were others who felt that you know it's unclear at this point exactly what did happen and you know until investigation as conclusive they were going to get the Saudis the benefit of the doubt\nHave you heard anything yet at this conference that makes you think ... that will determine new American investment in Saudi Arabia or hurt existing ties with the kingdom\nI think so I mean I think it will depend somewhat what additional evidence comes out going forward but you know people\nThat the the big banks and biggest brands and business are going to be reluctant to jump back in right away but you know the potential damage the brand as well companies in Silicon valley which are very focused on you know ethical investing\nThe defense companies were less reluctant than the big banks to step away from the conference I think they just seem less concerned about the backlash against their friends and this is such a important market for them to be involved in I think it would be economically thing just for them to step away\nThat's Allan Rapaport of the New York times thank you so much for joining us today\nThank you for having me and here in

all things considered I Know if the chain it's been three weeks and a day since dissident Saudi journalist ... show she went missing it's been five days since ... death was announced on Saudi state TV\nThroughout that time the Trump administration's position on the killing of ... and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nHas been evolving the president has condemned the killing that still has not condemned the Saudi crown prince\nOr said whether he believes NBS and he's referred to played a role when Republican senator who has been a vocal critic of the Saudi king in his policies and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself is Indiana senator tot young it's called the crown prince impulsive\nAnd reckless and says the U.S should send to Saudi leader a message senator young welcome thanks for having me also so what is the message the U.S incentives Saudi Arabia right now\n[noise] um it's crystal clear Americans won't stand for this sort of behavior we've seen in recent weeks and I would say uh over the last couple of years uh the behavior coming from\nThe Saudi Government and more specifically from the Saudi heir apparent a prince Mohammed is contrary to our values our international laws in our national security interests\nHasn't been a mistake for President Trump to put so much trust didn't sell men's pledged reformers country then\nLook I think it's really important that we work with security partners in the middle east there aren't many options to choose from a but we do have leverage a as a country to use against the Saudis to bring them in a better behavior so that they're not repeatedly killing civilians\nThrough airstrikes using our weapons in our fuel is they've been doing for the last couple of years in Yemen so they're not murdering journalists are like Indiana State a graduate or ... in the Washington Post journalist\nSo these are the sorts of things that we need to not only highlights but we need to begin holding the government in Riyadh to account on on account of these actions\nAnd on holding Riyadh accountable\nMost of your colleagues in Congress have been calling for a regime change in Saudi Arabia for the crown prince to be replaced do you agree that that would be a good step\nBut look we're still confirming certain details with respect to a this most recent tragedy\nIn the interim I've been encouraged that the administration is revoking the visas of individuals we already know had been involved in this ... situation I'm but I'm not prepared to rule anything out\nUh I I think we should suspend all arms sales until we know more and we should most certainly should stop refueling Saudi coalition aircraft are engaged in the sort of atrocities I'd just referenced in the country of Yemen\nRight you mention that you would like to see Saudi arms the Saudi arms deal with the U.S get ripped up the President Trump has talked a lot recently about all the jobs that would be lost if this White House tore up that arms deal with Saudi Arabia do you share the president's concerns about jobs being lost\n[noise] look I think that the number of jobs are the ... be Libi loss from this uh or frankly fairly minor I I don't see that as a major consideration I see this instead is a matter of upholding our values and um let's not forget our national security interests here\nThe country of Yemen has been destabilized by Saudi action\nThat country happens to be the headquarters of al ... in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous al ... affiliate out there so um it's essential\nWe've talked about what Congress could possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the president do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake of democracy oh jeez death\nWell I think uh the president's message I gather more information it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact he condemn the ... death as the worst cover up ever\nThat's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner rumors\nBut should President Trump had been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever him and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family and Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mom does that concern you\nKnow we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and um that's a ... something that has continued with this administration recognizing that the Saudis have
