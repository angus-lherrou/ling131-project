Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more it alliance for lifetime income dot org\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish ten suspicious packages have been intercepted so far the packages contain would appear to be explosive devices and were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThe FBI is saying it can't rule out that there may be more suspicious packages moving through the mail now and this story is put the U.S postal service in the spotlight joining us to talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies welcome to the city of models either\nWe don't know anything yet about who delivered these packages of what's known so far but how they were delivered\nRight so the FBI and the federal investigation arm for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question a earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted\nAt this point we know that at least seven to ten packages were handled by the postal service or the packages address for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance we're flag and mail screening facilities by the secret service to the packages addressed a Joe Biden were also found in postal facilities in Delaware\nObviously that's important because us PS has screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like this\nWhen it comes to mail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening\nProcedures so it's really different based on a number of different factors you know the size of the package for instance or maybe most importantly is who that package is going to\nIf you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance uh it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facilities check for suspicious looking items so the suspicious items that we're talking about\nA period of ... up and sent using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process at the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they that because of the crazy volume that the that they deal with that can't screen every single item that enters the system\nSo they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a when going through their own mail\nOn the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have caused can you give us some context like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYet it's maybe not as rare as one would expect they the the U.S Postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year I kind of puts it into perspective a specifically when it comes to investigations um they open Nineteen investigations into\nA hazardous material that could be bombs that could be chemical weapons that were being\nI'm uh trying to be delivered it could even be hoax a bombs are hoax chemical weapons as well and they were able to gain\nA twenty convictions in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigation we are talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics ah is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nOr not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved or in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now I talked with somebody at the American postal workers union\nWho made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials in the media members in the case of CNN who\nSeemed to have been targeted by these packages but there's also postal workers who were put in danger who were carrying patch point a to point B were also in danger in these situations\nOr if you remember back two thousand and one in the anthrax attacks there were two postal workers who died back then um so there's no indication that any policies are going to be changed but we are definitely seeing how people on higher alert\nThat is NPR's Miles parks thanks so much thank you\nTo another

or mom and dad have left because they're out ...\n... who are says grandparents are raising many of those kids but in some families myth know spends three generations\n[laughter] well it's interesting because this book collects portrait some photographs that you've done from from many years a long career in many cases countries you've gone back to again and again and again and watched um as as the change and I assume as you as a photographer\nChange when you look back at at photos from say your first trip to a country like Afghanistan differences\nWell first of all I wasn't as adept with the camera so I didn't understand how to read light and to anticipate shots the way I Do now\nYou know photographing under the Taliban was illegal the only thing that was legal was photographing destruction so buildings any inanimate objects and so for me of course my purpose was to photograph life under the Taliban so exactly what was forbidden\nAnd so I went into women's hospitals are photographed women and labor photographed women at home you know all these things that I Wish that I just I'm\nDo how to work a situation more\nAnd that's just the wisdom of experience figuring out what worked and what didn't know how hard you can push against the boundary of what you're being told\nTo do exactly exactly and those are things that it's not only about photography it's about reading human beings and reading people and and understanding how to express the importance of you know this job\nWe'll talk more about how you think about that because you also capture women in incredibly candid more vulnerable moments women in childbirth women being treated for for severe self inflicted burn um what's your etiquette for for photographs like that do you always get their permission before you raise your camera\nAlways before I take any pictures I introduced myself\nI explain that I'm working for whatever publication it's four and not the images will be seen by a lot of people\nAnd they can be on social media that's something that I now have to talk about because it's not only for the publication out and it just spread very quickly over social media so that's something that's very important for the subject to know because\nYou know there's Facebook and most of the countries I work and and I talk about why I'm doing these stories you know I don't just walk in there like I have the right to take their picture I talk about\nYou know I think it's really important to see how women are suffering or how women are dying and childbirth and so that's the first thing I Do and a lot of women say no and that's totally the right to say now is\nThat where you operate standard among war photographers understanding there is no playbook that everybody gets their should but I'm curious your mail photographers take that much sensitivity and advance\nI've been told that it's rare that people work the way I work that they take the time to be very respectful and to ask people how they feel comfortable being photographed you know I also have to discuss nudity\nFor example I was shooting maternal mortality recently in Somaliland and that's a very deeply conservative country in place and they're\nThe women you know they said okay if you photograph for example the baby coming out and I don't want my face or you have to cover or you know and they give me the rules and that's what I Do\nYou're making me think of a photograph that you took up a woman named I pack a who's was she was raped during\nWar and South Sudan Iraq by the time you met her she was very pregnant yeah as a result of that rape you spent several hours photographing her in a dress and then you thought you know from trying to show her belly her pregnant checkpoint here\nDo we do this without close I'm a ... as you were photographing her showing her images on your camera correct to make sure she understood what it looked like\nAnd I also before I even approached her with sort of what I envisioned I went to Kimberley who was the woman who had sort of rescue her and given her the safe house and said you know does this seem insensitive how do you feel about this is this\nSomething that would be rude to ask and she said no absolutely not let's take this to her and see how she feels and so we went and sort of talk to her through it and before I even finished my son she had taken her dress off and it was like totally she completely understood\nAnd you know as a woman I haven't been raped but I I have been assaulted in Libya I was groped repeatedly and I made a decision to talk about that very openly because I think you know as a survivor it's important to try and strip away the stigma and I ...\nDifferent women feel comfortable with feeling different things about themselves and some people do and some people don't and that's one thing I've learned over the years and I think with Iraq\nIt was something she wanted to do she wanted to show what had happened to her to sort of talk about it it was part of her therapy and I think it's very important for me as a photographer to not make those rules for people and everyone has the right to decide how they want to portray themselves you've\nTalked in past about what a huge advantage it as if anything to be female and a lot of the places where you're trying to work because as we're hearing you have access to half of the population that are male photographer might not have access to what I Love doing that kind of surprised me in this book as you also get great shots of American women there's a photo going here\nOf a navy lieutenant in the nurse corps she's stationed in Helmand Province of an age than Amy okay ... the shots describe or you've caught her in the ladies' room Amy\nI mean this is after a very intense ah I was on a medivac in bed and um they would bring wounded soldiers out and Amy was a navy nurse and she was you know they're in the trauma hospital\nAnd so after a an intense night I sort of followed her back to the shower is where the women go and I you know I was like I Want to just shoot what your life is like here and she was completely\nLike fun and open and got it\nShe's she's I should explain she's got shaving cream ... up are lagging shaving it made me I look at it and I'm thinking why would you bother to shave in hell no [laughter]\nI can tell you why because as a woman who has worked in like a very male world and in a war zone for Twenty years I Do everything I can still try and feel like a woman you know whether that means like sneaking eye liner on in the middle of Helmand or lipstick or\nPerfume I always carry perfume and my camera\nBag H its psychological because I have to sort of maintain some semblance of myself\nYou're right they're shaving in the in the next shower stall\nAnd yeah and that was the fun of photographing women in the military because it's like it was the first time that I actually had women to hang out with because for so many years and was just me or me and my colleague Elizabeth Rubin or me and whoever the only two women for miles [noise]\nThat is Lindsay and Oreo talking about her new book of love and war

S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern trying all nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cut foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to\nLeave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nIt is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adverse impact or investigation or a future prosecution\nAll the intended target so far have been vocal critics of President Trump the president has called for unity and an end to personal attacks in public speech those such attacks have been a regular feature of his political rallies Quil Lawrence NPR News New York\nMegan Kelly is in returning to NBC's Today show\nAfter she made remarks seemingly defending the desire of some white people dressed in blackface for Halloween parking outrage on social media and within the network she later apologized a person was direct knowledge of the situation tells NPR negotiations between Kelly and the network continue\nWild swings on Wall street this week but positive territory by today's bell with our racing much of it's more than six hundred point drop from yesterday Jake hand to hand is chief market strategist for today America a marriage trade he says the swings are making investors look at their portfolios\nI think what they have done is they've and and perhaps in a good sense to me people look at their investment can say is this really where I Want to be\nFor the last quarter into next year\nAnd by the bell but that was up four hundred one points than ethic up two hundred Ninety five hundred up forty nine you're listening to NPR News scientist say an ancient part of the brain may help us navigate the modern world NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on a new study in the journal neuron\nThe study looked at the cerebellum a part of the brain known for its role in balance and precise movement\nBut a team at Washington University in St Louis thought the cerebellum might be doing more than that so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Scott Merrick says they found that most of the cerebellum is connected to brain areas that carry out higher order thinking\nIt's important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\nFunctions like planning and using language Merrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks instead it seems to act like a quality control unit making sure they're done right Jon Hamilton NPR News\nOn the northern ... islands at least one person is dead from typhoon you to a strong category ... storm and it could be months before power is restored to the U.S territory\nThe national weather service says the storm with maximum sustained winds of one hundred Seventy eight miles an hour is the strongest one on record to hit a U.S territory and even though the islands are accustomed to strong storms the island of ... took a direct hit ravaging much of a sigh pan\nGirl prices were hired by the closing bell gaining fifty one sense to end the day at sixty seven dollars thirty three cents a barrel I'm Janine hurts NPR News in Washington\n[noise]\nOn the next kid can act will discuss all the biggest stories of the week we found media roundtable weaken review\nAlso we'll look ahead to porch fest in historic Springfield I'm Melissa Ross get plugged in with first 'cause connect sponsored by a Baptist Health and north Florida TPS friday at nine AM on eighty nine nine W.
