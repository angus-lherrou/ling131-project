headlines\nBut when you look at how people are responding there a gender divide but it is also largely a partisan divide I mean when you look at the polling we have on foreign cabin all over the last few weeks Republican women are much closer to Republican men than they are to democratic women likewise\nDemocratic women and democratic men are very close together so those divides largely partisan\nThat's NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben things Kenya thank you\nThe fight over Kavanaugh's nomination could have major consequences at the polls this November a survey out today from NPR PBS NewsHour and ... college shows the Republican voters are right now as energized as democratic voters is a major change from last month when enthusiasm among Republican voters was lacking\nThe Democrats NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is here with results or the ... hey there Ari how big is the surge of interest among Republican well the percentage of Republicans saying that the election is quote very important has shot up from the summer when we pulled in July it went from sixty eight percent then to now eighty percent\nWhich is almost the same level as Democrats and that is really striking\nAnd should be a huge warning sign to the Democratic party because all year we've been talking about how democratic enthusiasm has been outstripping Republicans and how that could lead to this eventual blue wave\nYou know everything Republicans are have tried to increase the Suzie as him so far had fallen flat whether it was tax cuts are talking about the broader economy even the threat of impeachment to the president\nNothing really fired up the Republican base until now is it clear that this is all about how it off well look I asked that question of our pollster Lee mirroring off of um Maris and his response was is quote\nThe result of hearing at least in the short run is the Republican base has awakened so it does appear yes it has been the camera here is 'cause we pulled a week earlier and we've seen this change he also stressed that there's um a month from the election\nAny number of things can and have happened in that amount of time and whether Kavanaugh eventually gets through or is eventually sunk\nWill really have some influence on how fire to Republican voters are anything can happen\nIn those thirty four days we've heard from Kavanaugh and from his accuser Christine Blasey Ford was the whole show about who people say they believe from is really important and more are saying they believe Christine Blasey Ford than Brett Kavanaugh\nThat was true narrowly when we pulled a couple of days before the hearing and it only has grown afterward about half of people say they believe Ford\nWell only about a third say they believe Kavanaugh\nUh and that's been an increased margin from last weekend at first blush as Daniel mentioned earlier men and women are starkly divided\nA and it but it's really a partisan divide and the and actually it was really interesting here is that the largest group\nOf people that say that they believe Ford in the poll that she's telling the truth democratic men [noise]\nYou've talked about enthusiasm when you look ahead to the election thirty four days from now or what do the numbers show about who the public would prefer to control Congress Democrats or Republicans right all year it's been true that Democrats have lead on this question to continue to lead on this question but\nOnly by six points now that's been cut in half in the past\nMonth and guess what all of that movement in in the past week has been among men just in the past week those men have gone from being evenly split on whether they'd vote for a Republican or Democrat in their district to now saying they prefer Republican by ten points\nWomen on the other hand you have Democrats at twenty pointing advantage that something that they've been saying all along so you can see really who vis a vis Kavanaugh hearing really affected and had the most impact on is the takeaway\nHere that the quote unquote blue wave seems less likely today than it did a month ago\nI think absolutely that's one take away and I think that there there have been warning signs for Democrats that that the blue wave wasn't going to be as big as it could be because Republican enthusiasm even at a lower level was still higher than out parties in past wave years\nSome parents to medical mountain are with results of this new ...

his fortune using a one time loan from his father\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nThat identity as a self made success was central to Trump's presidential campaign now a major investigation by the New York times demonstrates the ways in which that story is false the reporter show that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years starting as a toddler\nAnd the story reveal schemes the Trump family used to avoid gift and the state taxes schemes that stretch and possibly break tax laws ... there was one of the reporters who wrote the story welcome to all things considered thanks are\nHow did Donald Trump requires so much wealth from his father over the decades\nIt's a complex story we found two hundred Ninety five unique streams of revenue that Fred Trump's set up over the years to funnel money to his children especially to Donald Trump who was always sort of his favorite child\nI Want to get into a couple of those streams in detail but first us to talk about where the story comes from you write that you had more than a hundred thousand pages of documents as well as interviews what kinds of documents are we talking about here\nBy the time we were all done we had more than two hundred tax returns related both Fred Trump personally and to his various business entities we had general ledgers bank account statements property records and some court records that were helpful to time the pieces together\nOkay sort of dig a little bit more deeply into this reporting you've got about ten blockbuster stories and this one's sprawling article and I'd like to tell me about one of them\nYou write about a company the Trump family created called all county building supply and maintenance and in theory this was a company to purchase and install refrigerators and other appliances improper to use it for Trump owns in practice it allowed for Trump to transfer huge amounts of money tax free to his kids how did this work\nAll county looks like a company\nKnow when you hear the name but it actually had no existence in the world other than on paper Fred Trump I'd always negotiated personally the\nPrices for the things he bought boilers roofs but in Nineteen Ninety two bills for those items began being in voice from a company called all county building supply all county within voice\nGet the money and then they would create another in voice to Fred Trump's businesses with a twenty percent thirty percent like pat added on to that or a hundred percent in some cases you say and some in some cases there were some cases right where they're getting things for free and then building\nFor Trump's businesses whenever the cat was would just be split\nBetween Fred Trump's for surviving children who are the owners of already\nThat's right and they were performing no work for that the only work was done by an employee of Fred Trump's who was also a nephew of his ... employees secretary who handled these buildings things uh among her other tasks\nFor Trump to gifts to all of his children but Donald you write more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there's an instance where\nHe bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino but there was one time the father pushed back against us on Donald Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia Donald Trump tried to change his father's well what happened\nThat was right in Nineteen Ninety or Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by who's creditors and he had some lawyers right up a caught us all a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings who is doing this you just have the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and but the piece of paper in front of him\nHis father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back and ultimately called Donald Trump sister who was then a federal judge in a lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and Donald we wouldn't have any more control or employed over the state than any of his other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well we think that's not\nTrue um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about the transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings\nAnd that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me or the New York times story you just heard about says that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nIt seemed to me
