state what state you are in Mexico or what country you're from Central America\nHe says he had to conform to survive the\nActual moment then you know kind of shocked me into it was when one of the older Mexican guys one of my neighbors\nWere walking the chow and he had this you know hand the bar moustache you know and it sounded like he was talking to the movies you know he had that makes me an accent that stereotype you know and he says you know ... we don't talk to these ... you know we don't engage with them we don't do business with them\nAnd if you do you're going to get in trouble at least you're going to get beat up at wars you going to stab\nI knew then that I was in a different world because of the consequences their relatives standoffs among prisoners where we had like the stair downs right where it was like get off my table type thing right\nAnd one particular incident that I remember they had just brought this new picnic table onto the yard\nAnd everybody wanted it because it was by the basketball court the black sand on it and they claim to in the Mexicans were like hey man oh no we want that table\nThey were literally willing to kill somebody for a damn table

I live like what was his roommate is from Mexico\n\nLike a big person's closet you know bunk bed and then you have a lock her in the bank right above the toilet and to think\nYeah so it's you know on the wall and the bunk at the same time\nBut then Clinton today is getting more and we had the Haitian and getting prisoners from different backgrounds to play sports together worked together that was new for Jesse for Fifteen Years he'd only socialized with prisoners with Mexican heritage\nWas like a fish out of water I was uncomfortable because of\nThe camaraderie that there was amongst races when I Would walk the yard it bothered me that blacks whites Mexicans were playing basketball together or that there are playing baseball was like man these guys are out of line he didn't know who to trust one of my um first neighbors when a guy here in West luck\nHe offered me a burrito one night and I was hungry at hill and the black guy and he's offering more real and I said oh no I Can't take this hell no you know I thought it was a set of mind when I got back in the ...\nYou know I started thinking wow you know I'm I'm really hungry I back on and he looked at me and he says you know it's not like that here you know I started thinking about that\nHe started getting involved and found his place at a newspaper published here this than Clinton is one of the only president newspapers in

where\nWe don't even communicate with other races\nBonner ruined Jesse are now really tight when I first met Jesse that I think I was going to be that close to him no absolutely not right because Jesse these kind of stand up is you know you don't know how to approach to Jesse you know he got their start in look I guess is um all the years that he's been incarcerated you know however um since the time that I have known him\nThat brick wall has been coming down slowly but surely and he smiles more he plays more and he even gave me a hug me All right\nJesse says he's been thinking a lot about his childhood his mix of friends back then\nYou know I went away from um\nFrom my childhood and I've kind of slid too far you know I was just like\nStuck he has a wider group of friends now and

maybe most memorable for another discovery it portends NPR's Joe Palca has more\nThere are several things that do make the new object nicknamed the goblet remarkable Scott Sheppard says size is not one of them\nOn a small end of a dwarf planet we don't know exactly how big it is but we think it's about three hundred kilometers in size which was about six or seven times smaller than what poodle is\nShepherd is an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution for science he and his colleagues first spotted the object in twenty Fifteen\nThere's only one thing we know immediately when we find an object and we know its distance from the sun but that's all we can say we can actually say anything about its orbit\nThree more years of measurements have revealed the new objects orbit and it's a doozy first the goblins orbits isn't even close to round like earth it's a very elongated ellipse next it takes forty thousand years to make a single revolution around the sun\nAnd it never gets closer to the sun than six billion miles about twice as far as Pluto is from the sun objects this far out with really elongated orbits are just weird\nThe current models of solar system formation don't protect these objects\nJuliet Becker is an astronomer at the University of Michigan now it's possible that these models are wrong but Becker says a better explanation may be the giant planet some astronomers thinkers out there\nAnd easier solution is the existence of planet nine because it naturally creates these objects in the solar system\nThe gravity of big planet like Jupiter or Neptune Ken slings smaller objects into weird orbits if they happened to wander by but the goblet doesn't get anywhere near Jupiter Neptune so some astronomers think planet nine might be out there doing the swinging\nBecker says right now only a handful of objects points so the existence of planning on so there's plenty of skepticism that it really exists\nI guess I have kind of a ticker in my mind of how many new objects do we need right now we obviously don't have enough but this particular object is such a unique orbit and it's so useful but like I the kicker in my mind just jumped up like where a lot closer to having enough objects\nCertainly the goblet gives new confidence to several teams already searching for planet nine but so far no luck Joe Palca NPR News [noise]\nYou're

people he'd end up slurring his words stumbling is not credible for him to say he had no memory lapses and the nights he drank to access I Know because I drank with him um how should we assessed that\nGoes on if you if you kept reading and says she actually can't point to any specific instance like that\nUm the quote that jumped out at me was for it was a sloppy drunk and I know because I drank with him um\nThere's also I don't think I don't I I Do not think that's a fair characterization\nAnd this back and forth for people who are looking for\nBrett Kavanaugh not being fully truthful about his drinking this this back and forth would be where you would find that uh there have been a lot of people who've come forward and said\nThey think that actually was a pretty fair characterization I should add though that the White House has delivered to me statements from a couple of people who have not went to college with including a sweet mate\nWho says that he saw cabin on not just at the end of the night but also in the morning and said that he did not see behavior that involved blackouts or anything at the level that has been described\nBy others so what do you make of these dueling narratives that we heard represented by President Trump and Senator Schumer haven't listened to the test them\nAbout whether he was truthful or not\nPresident Trump said today that lying to Congress would not be acceptable but President Trump does not believe that Kavanaugh lied to Congress he believes in and talking to people at the White House who are working on Kavanaugh's nomination\nThey believe that in Kavanaugh's opening statement that clip that we played earlier where he says\nI drank to access I drank a lot of beer I liked to be here and I did things that I look back on and cringe that that although it is broad and not specific\nCovers just about everything they say you know he admits to everything except blacking out and when it comes to blacking out that is much more difficult to answer definitively\nIs all of this likely to have an impact on the three or so senators who appear to be on the fence\nIt's hard to know a those three Republican senators say that they are waiting for the FBI investigation to come through they keep getting asked in hallways by reporters whether lying matters to them but\nYou know the definition of lying may be different

of questions to lawyers who've been responsible preventing judges carry joins us now he carried I also\nSuit but the judge has already have to complete a pretty thorough and very long questionnaire is it surprising at the White House didn't touch any of these allegations of sexual misconduct and Brett Kavanaugh's case it's true that judge candidates gas a bunch of questions known in shorthand as the\nSex drugs and rock and roll questions things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a wrap sheet what about financial improprieties but those questions usually started age Eighteen and go forward\nIn this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh\nHappened when he was Seventeen year old to be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but there were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol from that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rock as parties to his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in
