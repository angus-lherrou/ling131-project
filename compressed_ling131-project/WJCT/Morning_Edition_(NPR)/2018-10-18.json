expected to push midterm turn out to levels that we haven't seen in decades\nRight early voting is underway and twenty states yesterday was the first day for voters in Tennessee to cast early ballots county election commission offices reported that lines were long in Georgia absentee voting has roughly doubled compared with this point in the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nNPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro has been following all this\nMorning are you still lines out the door at polling places voter turnout at numbers not seen in decades what's going on here well\nLook actually I I spoke with a turnout expert yesterday Michael McDonald at the University of Florida and he's forecasting that this year turnout is expected to jump to between forty five and fifty percent\nAnd that is remarkable for mid term generally midterms are pretty low turnout affairs only about foreign ten people who are eligible to vote cast ballots we'd a record low for Seventy years found in twenty fourteen\nAnd I you know that kind of turnout has not been seen since the mid Nineteen sixties if it gets to forty five fifty percent of course that was another time of social and cultural upheaval\nYeah that's a really interesting point what does a Mr McDonnell base his predictions on\nHe said he bases on essentially for things one that there was high turnout in primaries there was high turnout in special elections\nHigh self reported interest in the election and that these high levels of early voting that we've been talking about that they're taking place at all of those things all those indicators are pointing in the same direction with Donald told me quote it's probably going to be a turnout rate that most people have never experienced in their lives for mid term elections\nPretty excited [laughter] President Trump is headed to Montana today which is the start of a three day campaign trip to rally Republican voters so what seems is he going to be hammering on as we get closer to election day\nWell he's all about what he's dubbed the liberal angry mob or just last night he tweeted a head of his Montana trip about democratic incumbent Senator Jon tester and how he's quote worse than the Democrat mob and he's talking about because when testers office released information\nThat a doctor Ronny Jackson in the White House had fostered a hostile work environment that Jackson Mondo a withdrawing his nomination as VA secretary\nOr and despite his was drawn out Trump is digging in saying that you know tester behaved worse than the than the Democrat mob did with justice K that being justice Kavanaugh look this is pretty transparent Noel this this really has to do with Trump trying to keep the GOP based fired up heading into November we know what the Kavanaugh\nA confirmation battle did to Republican enthusiasm and spiking that\nTesters favored to win in one of these states that Trump won in and twenty sixteen and they are competitive races in Nevada and Arizona as well where Trump is also having\nThem in the last question for you real quick how does the high early voting numbers affect turnout on the actual election day Tuesday November six\nWell you know if you have something like a third of people turning out to vote early in this election it could lessen lines and make it easier to vote on election day itself but overall it'll bring the floor way up a which is what a lot of people are predicting now\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro thanks to medical You're welcome\nAll right so there were hopes for a deal to ease the departure of the United kingdom out of the e you but those hopes are fading after summit in Brussels that ended with no deal\nRight and there are no further talks expected in coming weeks so you officials say they are preparing for the worst case scenario\nWe are harting or lots of people for our customs and the commission river ... to work with even more vigor\nOr or no deal scenario multiple you expected to happen to have to prepare\nThat was the voice of the Netherlands prime minister mark route to offering that uh what no one really wants to help in the worst\nCase scenario other NPR psoriasis are hot enough and has been covering all this from Brussels she's with us now good morning ...\nGood morning so we cannot downplay the importance of this summit this was a big deal there were high expectations going into it right\nThere were but those expectations ... excuse me those expectations died along with a sense of urgency that something had to happen today if there was supposed to be a deal implemented in time so instead of seeing what we normally see at the sun is a which are people\nAre like staying up till the wee hours of the morning looking bleary eyed camera out a deal we had the EU leaders going out for fries and beer um after a very civilized to our dinner meeting on so\nThere really is nothing in the works at the moment\nWas British prime minister Theresa May invited for beer and price\nShe was not part of the outing was neighbors uh Germany France luck Sandberg in Belgium the leaders of those countries that went out\nAll right so what exactly went wrong at this summit\nWell it goes back to this old issue that's been just pervasive all along with ... holding things up and that's the border between uh the the country of Ireland which isn't the EU in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. they just can't come to an agreement about\nWho's going to run the border I mean will it be an open border is the are you going to continue to be linked to the u._k. that sort of stuff so it is they just cannot come to an agreement on it\nWell the ... you had asked to read somebody to come to Brussels and give them some new ideas on the border did she have anything\nShe did not she was very positive people talked about her body language the various leaders who spoke with the press or that she's very positive but she had nothing new to offer a she did seem to be a little bit more than ... and to compromise or that's what they were getting out of it\nWe heard the Netherlands prime minister said his country and the European Commission are preparing for that march two thousand Nineteen breakfast aid to come without an actual deal what would that look like\nWell it would be really problematic uh for one thing you're talking about the ... the country or the u._k. being in the ... right now you don't have really borders I mean there's a sort of a joint approach to customs free good\nA free trade of goods that sort of things you have to create the mechanisms in order to have a border to have customs that sort of thing that that takes a lot of doing a\nAs does air safety I mean for example you know airports interact and and now you have to create new deals these things take time and it's just not something that's going to happen quickly\nNPR's psoriasis are hiding now since right thanks so much You're welcome [noise]\nThis is

Netherlands prime minister mark ... and ... and nothing has been following all of this from Brussels she's with us now ... good morning Noel so we should not under play at this summit there were some high expectations that this might finally seal of Brexit deal right\nYes that was definitely characterize at the make or break of whether there would be an breaks that deal a button said everybody backpedaled a and in fact uh some of the the leaders of the ... went out for beer and and French fries to sort of underscore how relaxed they were at this point and how they had no expectations anything was going to happen\nWhile that is some telegraphing fair so what went wrong exactly\nWell it's the same old issue that's been holding up this deal for for many months now and that is what happens between the republic of Ireland which is part of the emu and Northern Ireland which is a province in a United Kingdom\nYou know do you put a hard border there do you not uh people are very concerned if there is a hard border there that it would threaten to peace deal so they don't want that but they just can't come to an agreement where they should put the boarder who should run that border how the customs union would work and it just they don't seem to be getting any closer on that point\nWas that you had explicitly asked Theresa May to come to Brussels and give them some new ideas that would help and all of this I did she bring anything\nShe did not um but uh ... what's really interesting is that there seems to be a lot of sympathy for her even though she didn't uh for example to lug simmered prime minister ... said he realizes that prime minister May's in a tough spot at least one point he realizes that\nThe reason I'm losing the tricky situation because she felt

leaders are counting on their negotiator Michelle barred gay to help break this logjam\nWell we heard the Netherlands prime minister saying his country and the European Commission are basically prepping for that march two thousand Nineteen breakfast day to arrive without a deal if that happens what would that look like\nWell it would be absolute chaos because you're talking about having to create new customs unions knew or knew customs and border is basically you know have security people to to vet people with passports coming through\nA you're talking about way uh increase costs to various countries Germany for example is estimating more than a hundred and ten billion dollars in costs that they would incur um if if breaks it were to happen in terms of increased taxes and that sort of thing\nUh so it's it's just something that nobody wants on either side of this equation\nHow likely is that cast to happen at this point\nWell everyone is still saying that they are cautiously optimistic it won't happen that they come to a deal or possibly a in December\nUh so it's something that they're going to work towards at this point the negotiators have to come back to the table and try to hammer out something that everyone can live with so still a lot\nTo be done NPR psoriasis are hiding now since ... thank you so much here welcome\nHurricane Michael devastated parts of the

honorable discharge they don't typically qualify for a VA benefits even though many like owning struggle with service related trauma it's a group with a high suicide rate\nTo address that the VA last summer's started a new program this group of veterans can come into the VA and be treated for mental health issues at least for Ninety Days\nWe asked the VA how many people use the program and the first year\nThe agency gave us figure showing that nationally one hundred and Fifteen veterans did a fraction of the veterans who would now qualify for mental health care [noise] twenty five of those patients were in San Diego sector Neal door and he's with the San Diego VA\nThat came in and saying that they had an urgent need and and they were evaluated and received care for for that urgent need whether it was a substance use disorder or suicidal thoughts\nVeterans advocates are disappointed that just one hundred and Fifteen people took advantage of the program when the da says there at least five hundred thousand veterans with other than honorable discharges Christopher Goldsmith is an Iraq vet who works with the Vietnam veterans of America\nIt's not possible that that the number of people who need it's a failure to contact them to fully formed them and some of the stigma\nVietnam veterans of America lobbied the VA to help veterans with other than honorable discharges executive director Rick weidman says the da just simply didn't promote the program\nIt's a program that most people who are eligible for it I don't know about and the reason for that is that be a refused to do outreach\nDr Keeter Franklin heads the VA suicide prevention programs she said the VA tried to get the word out through veterans' organizations\nWe rolled it out rather quickly are rejected like eating out versus messaging across the board just to get a message out ... large across also allow ... car rental record that part of the ...\nThe old Ninety Days program is about to get a much larger mandate democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut was able to push through legislation that will require the VA to treat vets with other than honorable discharges Murphy says as long as there are mental health issues are related to their service\nIf you have PATS the man because of that Patriot's day you act out you should not lose eligibility for you or veterans' benefits that's what's been happening\nThe new law also and the Ninety day cap which some veterans advocates say made the program even harder to navigate and it requires the VA to seek out people who qualify\nThat means service members leaving now but also hundreds of thousands who left with less than an honorable discharges in the past finding those veterans will be tough\nI felt shot I still feel shut\nAfter years of being rejected Josh owned and is now getting his pie TST treatment paid for by the VA he says it's been a lifesaver but\nHe fears other veterans have already given up\nI wouldn't be surprised that most of them aren't alive and the reason why I say that is without treatment without proper care even loved ones like I don't think without God and my family I tell her to have done with it I don't want to do anymore\nMurphy's legislation gave the VA one hundred and eighty days to set up its outreach program that deadline has already passed in a written statement the da says it is quote writing

and Google have greater sway over the economy then the president Congress or workers Molly Wood is the host of marketplace tech Hi Molly\nHayes debris so this was a big majority Seventy eight percent of Americans say financial institutions and tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy does this make sense to you or are Americans overestimating the power of tech and big finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified result it crossed all the demographic lines it was male or female it was Republican and democratic or the people that Edison point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent was a majority but sixty percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to the sort of\nThe mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies then we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders has pressed Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they leading or are they having a lot of attention drawn to themselves\nI think we are increasingly seen policymakers start to ask the very real question about how much influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm\nFederal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole it's a big summit and Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and how they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concern seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so\nIt is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans concerned\nNevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about it and they want these platforms to do better because frankly that's the only thing that's going to push them in that direction\nBollywood host a marketplace tech\nThank you so much thanks very [noise]\nYou can check out

we have to leave them because when ... when all these civilians were being killed they told us it was by accident even though all you have suggested otherwise and so I think\nAnd I've been making is to my colleagues for years the Saudis on telling us the truth um that they are in fact along to us and I now think that many of my colleagues eyes are being open\nTo the prospect that Mohammed bin Salman has not been straight with the United states about other things I'm just like he is not straight with the United states uh about\nWhat happened to your mom showed senator as you well know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia into question experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to geo political stability in that region\nAre those risks enough to stay the hand of the United states\nAll this idea that the United states more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous I'm\n... and how it was important well it's important to remember that\nIf Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states or Saudi Arabia I'm frankly at this point more than the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on foreign oil than we were in the past um and and I would also argue that\nWe need to look at a broader scope of the train line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia a ... year selling

member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thanks you senator thank you ...\nIt was well known among western journalists who have covered Saudi Arabia and the broader region among them NPR's Deborah Amos that has been reporting from Saudi Arabia for decades her first trip there was back in Nineteen Ninety One and she joins us now thanks for being with us today\nThank you what went through your mind as you read this final column from ... in the Washington Post you know in a way for me it felt like an ... for a man\nWho was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember his disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in Bahrain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career of the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been a reason for his demise\nBecause as you note so he was working for the post and now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm it's much\nMore powerful so as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger or not to set the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia uh Mohammed bin some on can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who was in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin Salman moms rise has been very quick um and his sort of\nGoal is to move the kingdom of conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them in like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to jail people in a five star hotel he also jailed of Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with him so\nYou know at the same time he was fed in the west he was building this um you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria or you know we saw with the son of a Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers I'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as\nA man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom\nAnd that for certain he has not and I think that that is now dawning\nOn the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king saw him on decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replace him\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question a you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince says toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security\nTo allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now I I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes is

Trump Administration has been blocking the appointment and re appointment of judges to that panel so out of its members terms expire that Supreme Court of trade\nIs shrinking if it loses one more person it'll stop functioning we are joined by a former WWE CEO appellate body member Jennifer Hillman she served from two thousand seven to two thousand eleven good morning good morning\nSo a lot of people might not be familiar with this a WTO appellate body can you give us an idea of like what kind of cases would come before you when you were there\nAll of the cases are cases that are brought by one country against another country complaining that whatever that country did violated one of the rules of the WTO and they can range from really small cases to really big cases\nSo the Trump Administration just last month blocked the re appointment of a judge to that panel and it's now at the minimum number of judges I never got called judges are called members but the minimum number of judges it legally needs to even function\nSo it is not clear if the administration is trying to choke this court to death or if this is some kind of bargaining position what do you think they're trying to do\nI think they're trying to choke it to death um and I think they really are trying to effectively killed this dispute settlements system but this is just a decision by us Tiahrt to consistently blocked any process to allow for the appointment of any new members\nThe U.S has you know an array of complaints about the WTO a bit it's treated unfairly that there are reforms needed is

imposed\nTerrorists or other restrictions on imports coming into the U.S market and other countries have complained that we haven't done that consistently with those WTO rules\nDo you agree that there are other reforms needed a WTO you know it's not set up arguably to deal with a lot of complaints against China for example\nYes they're unequivocally aren't necessary reforms in my own view the biggest substantive failing of the trading system rules has been its inability to discipline subsidies\nProfessor Jennifer Hillman served as a WTO appellate body member\n... a a justice of trade from

the last column written by Saudi journalist Jim all ... he's the writer a U.S resident based in Virginia who disappeared after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish officials say the Saudi Government murdered him by President Trump says the U.S needs more evidence before holding the Saudis responsible\nWe've asked for it if it exists prices I don't know I'm not sure yet that didn't exist probably does passively does\nTurkish media reported the existence of a recording yesterday it allegedly captured the last moments of cars showed jeeze life\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has denied any involvement in the disappearance but some lawmakers are calling for Saudi Arabia to be held accountable Senator Chris Murphy is one of them he's a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations committee to morning senator\nMorning do you feel certain that you know what happened to democracy\nI I don't know that without the evidence that the Turks reportedly have I can say that I feel ... and\nUm but uh I have seen no evidence and I've seen the classified information available to members of Congress to suggest that there should be is alive or everything that I have seen 'em that spoke publicly available and privately to bail\nLeads me to believe that the Saudis good uh unfortunately more show inside that conflict\nSo then how does the U.S hold Saudi Arabia accountable at this point specific place\nOr the first thing we asked is for the president to do its own investigation and who's responsible and a sanction individuals they'd be believed order\nA this execution and so that process is underway the president's required by law to report to us on is finding a job but Congress can act on its own and I would argue that we should take the step of removing the United states from a military coalition with the salaries\nOf that is currently bombing of the country of Yemen resulting in thousands of civilian deaths inside that country and the reason that I think that these two should be linked is because the United states is partnering with Saudi Arabia because we believe that the salaries when they tell us that they are not intentionally killing civilians\nWith their bombing campaign given the fact that they are likely lying to us about what happened to your show I think that it is likely that they are also lying to us and have them lying to us for a long time\nAbout what they are doing inside Yemen I Believe as many others have but they are in fact\nTargeting civilians inside Yemen with the United states bombs with the United states a system that is the case that we shouldn't be any part of that coalition than it would be a I think important message to send to us that if you're not telling the truth but we're not going to be in business do\nYou live in making this point about Yemen and civilian deaths there and us involvement potential involvement in Yemen for some time but you are legislation to stop us support for Saudi Arabia in that war hasn't gained much traction\nWhat makes you think that this specific case of of an and allegedly murdered journalist might make any kind of difference might be a tipping point\nWill I Will admit I Am very frustrated that the United states has been assisting Saudi Arabia and killing thousands of civilians inside Yemen hasn't gotten\nMuch attention until the\nMurder of ... this journalist\nUm but I think it's getting attention now because the two are linked because we have supported Saudi Arabia is bombing campaign because we have to leave them because when ... when all these civilians were being killed they told us it was by accident even though all you suggested otherwise and so I think\nAnd I've been making is to my colleagues for years but the dogs on telling us the truth\nI'm there in fact lying to us and I now think\nThat many of my colleagues eyes are being open to the prospect that\nUm Mohammed bin Salman has not been straight with the United states about other things I'm just like he has not been straight\nWith the United states uh about what happened to your mom showed\nSenator as you well know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia into question a experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to geo political stability in that region are those risks enough to stay the hand of the United states\nOr this idea that the United states more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous\nI'm ... and how important well it's important to remember the if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past and and I would also argue that\nWe need to look at the broader scope of the train line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia when you're selling Saudi Arabia I'm much more arms today than we were ten years ago\nUm and and so what I'm suggesting that we were earns you a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years on suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thanks you senator among\nThe Associated Press asked President Trump this week if she would bear some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want to blame if the GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and says there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nNot only is it about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the president\nAnd why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nAnd Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for", "year": "2018",
