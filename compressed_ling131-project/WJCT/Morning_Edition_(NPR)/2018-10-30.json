nationalist\n... say they're not ready for politics right now as you're gonna roles for victims are just getting started I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm David Greene after the killings in Pittsburgh we've been learning about gab of social media site to learn how it's just one of the places where anti Semitism extremism live on the line\nAnd this hour Rachel Martin begins a series of conversations with voters about how personal question can shape there it is to the October thirtieth George Michael released his album face\nUm no other people's go on a throughout the week and one woman I spoke to name Jerry spin told me that of course this is a politically charged moment after all the midterms are are just a week away\nAnd she told me she tells me that um she's not expecting much from the president's visit but she is hoping that down the line there will be political change on the national level\nI Want to find other ways to commit myself to change both both in terms of my volunteer commitment since I'm retired and in terms of changing our national leadership\nOkay one of the voices we've heard in Pittsburgh through NPR's Brakkton Booker Brakkton thanks so much really appreciate it thank Steve\n... what\nEffect narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nMothers question curious new urgency after the events of recent days one man allegedly sent multiple pipe bombs too political and media figures and then another killed\nEleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue both were involved in social media conversations that featured explicit racist diatribe before they ventured into terrorism\nWell how to conspiracy theories persist and spread wealth summer has spent a lot of time thinking about this he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast morning search or one of the products for coming by what's an example of how this\nWorks the way that a conspiracy theory would start and and and go go national go go bed\nSure absolutely so really the most obvious example right now is uh is the so called caravan coming up from endorse we've seen the president sent troops down to the border are basically to respond to it as I say a fiction in terms of the actual danger posed the United states\nThis is something that bubbled up really on you know fringe Youtube videos Twitter red threads and now we see the president reacting to it\nOh wait a minute you're saying that this you can trace this back and some time before the president a became exercised about this it was a big deal on various sites\nExactly as you said there's been some analysis that looks really the first mentions of this and and the various ah you know so it's sort of fake news essentially use to promote as you know people will take a picture of someone with boils and then they'll say oh you know this is only the care of and it was completely unrelated but it kind of ramps up the hype about it\nAnd you end up with someone on Fox News which I Believe happened yesterday saying gosh these people might be bringing any number of diseases they had letters or what have you with us and the president the United states talks about this has this happened a lot with the president\nAbsolute as far from the first time a you know I think the most obvious example is when the president claimed after the twenty sixteen election that three million illegal votes were cast and causing the popular vote that was an idea he clearly got or is it through various channels from the wars and he sort of use that to then create the presidential voter fraud commission\nWhat are some of the influential sites hear the word gab I think is new to some people because the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting had been active I'm making anti Semitic remarks on gab ... what are some of the other ones that are Q\nA shirt so so there's various uh ... it's almost like a mirror world\nFor all these various site so you know YouTube would obviously be the main video say well if you're kicked off YouTube you might go to a website called like bitch shoot or something and so there's various a person's Facebook and Twitter and\nSo on and they don't say where racist we're here to be racist rice\n... ... you know it's interesting some of them do actively cord the alt right some of them have positioned themselves more as a broader free speech platform in the case of gap I think they definitely did a lot of outreach to the alt right and that was sort of part of their business model I'm\nBecoming more influential\nOr you know it's interesting I think they're very prominent within their niche I mean these sites are still like fractions of a fraction of what a a mainstream social media site without\n'em and do they get directly to policymakers or is there some intermediate a\nWell you know we've seen the president's a campaign manager Brad ... scale mentioned gab before is that you would join if they would take some technical issues so so are there are some links to the mainstream Republican Party\nWill summer thanks for coming by really appreciate it after having any reports for the Daily Beast\nAnd let's get an update now on one of the news stories that can be driven by conspiracy theories the U.S will deploy more than five thousand troops to the border with Mexico in an effort to stop a caravan of migrants some of whom say they eventually want to reach asylum in the United states\nYou know last night in an interview with ... the president said there are quote a lot of bad people and the caravan and he called it an invasion\nThousands and thousands of people in the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country\nAnd in a tweet President Trump said quote our military is waiting for you and quote Mexican authorities estimate that the caravan has about three to five thousand travel\nIt must check that out with freelance journalist David ... who has been traveling with the caravan he's now back in Mexico city he was with them just days ago welcome to the program\nA good morning I'm a first I Want to get a sense of how far away this caravan is from the border we're told that us troops will be at the U.S board Mexico border within days um is the caravan within days of the United states\n[noise] no not at all week skill a probably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in a caravan are saying that their destination teeth wanna which obviously across from San Diego\nAnd that's a quite a bit a more distant or with any luck they would make it to Mexico City\nProbably around ... uh the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nUnless checked the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United states who said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined in size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to to to estimate that yourself\nNobody knows for sure\nThe obviously the official number a that was given at the time the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday cheering miniature ... Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred and five people\nHow to apply for asylum another five hundred to go home of voluntarily mirrors along the route and put the number it closer to six thousand or not which is a because on the number of people that they were serving a because you're obviously providing a lot of food and uh\nObviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be hired and\nNot okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves at a a nightly they had it couldn't have innately assembly were they when they live in a in a in a village what they'll do is deal they'll set up camp and they'll they'll be in the town square and uh [noise] they will have an assembly\nOne which they will vote on proposals usually that eating when they will leave the next morning what will\nThey will take and the proposal was read to them and they voted to not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states felt that we still both of them will do their best to get to\nThe United states okay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here could be any other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there's no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get to you'll get that they're probably moved and moving about forty miles a day some days\nMore somebody left uh but that still putting them uh [noise] probably late November at the earliest they would get to the border to wanna\nOkay David Akron reporter has been traveling with the caravan thanks so much for a walk\n\nThis is NPR News\nHouses of worship are facing their worst fears yet again the pastor of America's biggest Methodist Church says he wants to bridge cultural divides and help the faithful through the troubles of the world we have more churches than any other denominations more churches in their post offices or McDonald's\nPasser Adam Hamilton on how his mega church meets these difficult moments next time on\nThe weekdays at eleven on eighty nine nine W.

and I'm David Greene in Culver City California how do fake narratives and conspiracy theories make\nIt from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events in recent days including after a gunman killed eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect posted explicit racist comments to social media an extremist conspiracy theories can also end up driving official policy will summer thinks about all of this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's with us this morning either well thanks for having me so what's a good example of how this for a short so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the dark as uh the edges of the right wing Internet or with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind it\nAnd uh you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off as sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you you are saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this so called caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it worked its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics\nAbsolutely people don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and it it kind of hit the hit the me enough and the message\nAnd then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on a you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah I\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories affect the actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast and you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that\nToo and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to raise the standards of the job of of the press to knock these things down should it fall to social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their\nYou know I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when the press tries to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people have kind of decided the balls and the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going I mean it seems like something that is really\nAccelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and ... and ... even before that a but it it is really exhilarated with social media and also I think uh the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't\nIn real life will summer

his top issue is health care\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the AC a very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there's talk when voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by a Republican income and Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold medal of government control your health care ending Medicare as we know doubling taxes we reached out

earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations well accusing golden end up being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really

say I'm ... I'm not\nGolden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for ... for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate public when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in ... refused to state whether he voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody way before\nI ask golden if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority\nI don't view my role as resistance I like to say I'm a marine no better friend no worst enemy if the president does something helps Maine I'm with them if he does something hurts Maine I'm going to stick up for our state\nLet your voices be heard joined the conversation on the border on Fridays at noon on W.

something that happens an immigrant and from assuming she knows better and it's one way to show explores identity\nAnd Easter bread creators America days he says he's glad there are more projects involving Muslims but he says there isn't going to be one breakout moment but hopefully there will be many moments and the more stuff that's out there even the bad stuff the better\nDot dot is the flexibility under privileged but I think I'm white communities or is that they're allowed to fail in Hollywood and no one really bats and I it's like it's okay you can you can jump back up and here it was thrown millions of dollars a gallon for you to bigger next project so that's the point that we have to go to\nIt's a struggle a lot of communities of color and minorities face in Hollywood\nThe two thousand Eighteen Hollywood diversity report from UCLA found that despite progress minorities are still under represented in key jobs from lead actors to directors to writers right now there's an appetite for shows about Muslims in part it's because of some writers like our daisy has written on Modern Family in outsourced are creating their own content\nAnd their support for it he got a grant for pop culture collaborative to create the series\nAnd some of the interest is Hollywood reacting to Anton from an anti immigrant sentiment from Donald Trump\nAfter he announced his candidacy in two

like scripts that use the term allow Akbar which means God is great\nSo you've seen many TV and film projects that have a whole lot about being used in very violent scenes\nHow they didn't negotiates the studios to try to get them to change it translated or offset it with happy scenes like saying God is great at a wedding or a dinner party because for Muslims it's a beautiful phrase portrayed as ugly\nYou know so someone's here's all the luck but when they're dining out and all of a sudden you know they're calling nine one one because they think of family is doing something bad when all

like he didn't care for sure I wouldn't vote for him again\nI just like his style I was just like the way he does things he's ... he's not going to shoot into anything\nOn the same way you know a bunch of people who don't like living in a little\nModern change\nAnd this is a big part of Trump's appeal we heard people talk about how when they're rooting for the president there really rooting for themselves\nAnd being just as humid as us the fact that he he failed how many times before he finally succeeded you know and I guess one of those tries finally worked out for him and he worked his way up\nThat is the voice of Alex Collins he's twenty four years old and he works the overnight shift at the male factory he and his fiance page Spencer\nThey're living a life you know so many Americans really they're almost never to get\nOn a Tuesday night recently they were huddled on the couch together watching TV this is the only our of the day when they get the hang out then it's out the door page drives Alex tore\nMe [noise] I Love him\nGetting home\nThen it's on to her personal routine drop 'em off\nSay bye love you and I come home\nSit down and watch TV at a couple of beers than how it was a ... planning or do laundry and then I usually am in bed anytime between like ten thirty and wine\nAt five AM for pages off to work at the restaurant she leaves Alex a list of chores there honeydew list he walks in the door around seven AM and it gets to work on it\nThe honey do list and then once I get through all that it's just time to wind down I mean lots of little TV mess around my phone come right around noon one o'clock it's time for bed I lay down semi alarms God I Wish I slept\nMore when he wakes up he gets that magical hour with page and then the cycle starts again as for politics Alex and page don't always agree she voted for Bernie Sanders last time Alix went for Donald Trump\nHe is always lean conservative partly because of his faith he's been a foster child homeless he fought a heroin addiction and in a way religion found him\nI didn't really believe in it too much up until the sixth or seventh foster home ended up in\nOne of my foster brothers actually stopped me one night he asked me some questions you know what I thought about God\nAnd he worked with me from their own and eventually down to the point where you know I was going to church every Sunday\nBut his vote for Trump wasn't about religion or party again it was about this deep personal belief that Trump could make everything right for him this young man making ten twenty five an hour and trying to build a life with his partner two years later he is starting to feel some doubts\n[noise]\nKind of question myself a little bit on on that decision that I made on voting for him I mean\nI'm not really seeing the results yet\nThings started getting a little bit more expensive I mean I'm surprised how much milk went up that was a big one for me I God I Love milk I like chocolate milk I drink it all the time and prices on things started going up and it's like why is that happening\nIn fact milk prices have largely gone down in Missouri since Trump became president but if Alex is paying more at his store and he uses that as a measure of this president it goes to show the kind of expectations he has\nYou know this man was supposed to be able to fix everything make everything better make prices go down you know\nQuantity go up quality go up and we're not really seeing results from that\nAnd the tariffs decision that that hit your workplace did that affect what you think of him\nYeah it kind of did whatever his reasoning for trying it than the timing was bad I feel like it ended up doing more damage to the economy and to America has a whole than it did for anything I mean two hundred people lost their jobs\nThat's a big blow to a small town like this you\nSound like you're open minded like you're giving him these two more years to kind of\nSee what happens I mean if he can show results and make things happen then he'll have my support again\n[noise] but until then I mean it's yet to be seen\nA small Missouri town where Donald Trump is absolutely getting his wish this political moment is very much about him one way or another\nSo David given how important Missouri is in the mid terms what does the president's support their means for people who were actually on the ballot this fall\nI mean he's a looming large everywhere Steve I think we're all hearing that as we travel the country there's voters out there who are paying attention to specific

roughly five thousand us troops to the border at rallies for Republican candidates this fall the president has explicitly port the distant caravan at the center of the election campaign and election seemed to be continued last night on Fox\nThousands and thousands of people on the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country where\nPresident was apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles away from the United states with that said there is a group of several thousand migrants with varying descriptions of its size and purpose to check the latest facts we called journalist David ... who was recently with that group and we asked first if it is getting near the U.S\n[noise] no not at all it's still a probably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in the caravan are saying that their destination is cheap wanna which obviously across from San Diego\nAnd that's a quite a bit a more distant or with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around ... of the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nI must check the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United states\nWho said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined in size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to to to estimate that yourself ... ...\nNobody knows for sure the obviously the official number a that was given at the time or the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred asked to go home of voluntarily mayors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand or not which is based because on the number of people that they were serving a because you're obviously providing a lot of of food and uh\nObviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nUh okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves had a they tend to have a nightly assembly were they when they arrive in a in a in a village what they'll do is they'll\nThey'll set up camp and they'll be in the town square and they will have an assembly one which they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning what route they will take\nAnd the proposal was read to them and they voted to not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states so that was so both of them will do their best to get the United states\nOkay so some of them some of them are coming to the ...\nThere could be here could be on the other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there's no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get they'll get that they're probably moved their moving about forty miles a day some days more some days less\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person couldn't cross the border and just wanted to be closer to the U.S children

money brought in with the federal deficit up Seventeen percent\nIn the accounting here just ended Stephen Moore thank you for joining us here thank you many worry that Republicans have gone soft on deficits and the quest to cut taxes are you going soft on if it's\nIf you don't get the economy growing faster than one half to two percent sure not gonna bring down the trade deficit you're not going to get new jobs get business is growing and a lot of these other problems are much easier to solve\nBut that's the answer to people who are particularly focused on the deficit is give it some time the editor oath will bring it down\nBut Trump has given us a lot higher growth already know look Republicans have done a terrible job of controlling spending and I'm the first one to point the finger so Republicans for that end Democrats you don't think\nThe president should be leaning on those Republicans a little harder on\nAs well yeah I think you should have veto some of those spending bills Trump takes a lot of criticism from conservatives for not talking about Medicare and Social Security which is you know it was a big part of adding bicycled entitlement programs my feeling as one of the reasons Donald Trump won the election is precisely because he said he wasn't going to cut Social Security and Medicare\nSo I mean when you step back from this though is the Trump Administration everything you'd hoped for when you through and you are a lot but the only time during the campaign is it is it a okay and\nAll that look I mean the proof of the putting us and eat it we've got the

right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect was an active user of the social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gained traction either well thanks for having me so what's a good example of how this were a shirt so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the dark as uh the edges of the right wing Internet or with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that\nAnd uh you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off as sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you you are saying that you've been able to actually\nTrack this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics\nAbsolutely people don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and that kind of hit the hit the me enough and the message\nAnd then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on a you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida it was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah I\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories effect actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to raise the standards of the job of of the press than not these things down should fall the social\nBut I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I

Wish I slept more when he wakes up he gets that magical hour with page and then the cycle starts again as for politics Alex and page don't always agree she voted for Bernie Sanders last time Alix went

in it too much up until the sixth or seventh foster home I ended up in\nOne of my foster brothers actually stopped me one night he asked me some questions you know what I thought about God and he worked with me from their own and eventually gone to the point where you know I was going to church every Sunday\nBut his vote for Trump wasn't about religion or party again it was about this deep personal belief that Trump could make everything right for him this young man making ten twenty five an hour and trying to build a life with his partner two years later he is starting to feel some doubts [noise]\nI kind of question myself a little bit on on that decision that I made on voting for him I mean\nI'm not really seeing the results yet\nThings started getting a little bit more expensive I mean I'm surprised how much milk went up that was a big one for me I God I Love milk I like chocolate milk I drink it all the time and prices on things started going up and it's like why is that happening\nIn fact the milk prices have largely gone down in Missouri since Trump became president but if Alex is paying more at his store and he uses that as a measure of this president it goes to show the kind of expectations he has\nYou know this man was supposed to be able to fix everything make everything better make prices go down you know\nQuantity go up quality go up and we're not really seeing results from that\nAnd the tariffs decision that that hit your workplace did that affect what you think of them\nYeah it kind of did whatever his reasoning for trying it than the timing was bad I feel like it ended up doing more damage to the economy and to America has a whole than it did for anything I mean two hundred people lost their jobs\nThat's a big blow to a small town like this [noise] you\nSound like you're open minded like you're giving him these two more years to kind of\nSee what happens I mean if he can show results and make things happen then he'll have my

wants to immigration to be a major issue President Trump has a new way to talk about immigration\nHe gave an interview to actually goes in which he said that he is interested in the idea of ending birthright citizenship that's the legal concept that someone born in the United states or to a U.S citizen is also entitled to be a citizen\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing to human lessons well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us it's ridiculous and it has to end\nA NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley joins us next morning Scott\nGood morning Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell uh it it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today\nThis was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team and we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this\nUntil now we are a week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in\nDrafting an order like this as just a left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over a there's an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of April where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a that conveniently rises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check a little bit of what we just heard the president said there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get\nEighty five years of benefits or the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and worked a job and creates a value for the economy correct\n[noise] well that's right and we're talking about sort of two phenomenon one is a babies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a a a nation\nA phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to us specifically for the purpose of of having children we should say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive order as it is a pretty constitutionally dubious\nAnd that's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying um\nYou need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boats so I'm going to try and scooter\n[laughter] he may try it and this certainly face a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this has catnip to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right Scott thanks so much really

rabbis have been going to the more to be with the bodies in the days since the shooting\nWas so we're we're not supposed to leave the body alone and we have people who come in and guard some can be with them while they're there they pray they say psalms and so it's just somebody should pass from this world by themselves and it's an honor someone for everybody who's who's involved in it\nDiamond

difficult thing to\nBurial traditionally takes place quickly in Judaism ideally within a day or two that timeline has been pushed back slightly because of the criminal investigations surrounding the

wallowing in our grief or we're not stuck in suspended animation as we anticipated burial that's at some later date\nThe funeral director says there will be heavy security and she'd expecting an
