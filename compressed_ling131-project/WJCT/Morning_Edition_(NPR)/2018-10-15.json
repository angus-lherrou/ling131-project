[noise]\n\nHarvard University faces a lawsuit this morning\nRight this is a high stakes legal action it could affect the future of affirmative action in university admissions and this case is different than other lawsuits that challenge preferences for underrepresented minorities this lawsuit is on behalf of Asian Americans and the charge the Harvard gave preferences to white Kirk\nCarapezza in Boston member station WBUR GBH is here either Kirk\nHey good morning the suit to about ... who's filing a\nWas filed by students for fair admissions it ended claims Harvard capped the number of qualified Asian American applicants by using personal ratings and in court over the next two to three weeks the group will need to prove that Harvard is intentionally rejecting applicants\nBecause of their Asian because of their race\nI just want to sound for a second you said yes students for fair admissions who could possibly be against that but this is a group with a particular point of view on the world right\nYes this group is led by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum you've filed previous a lawsuit against the University of Texas University of North Carolina I spoke with attorney ... he's with the Asian American legal foundation which is supporting this lawsuit Chang is Chinese American and he's also a Harvard graduate\nHarvard is systematically saying that Asian candidates are not like a bull in our and don't have good personality is by orders of magnitude again less than candidates of any other ethnic group which is really nothing but racist it perpetuates and feeds and create stereotypes\nI guess we should explain this kept saying that candidates are not likeable what they're referring to here as a kind of personal characteristics test or a evaluation that people are given when they apply and that is affected the number of Asians whites or anybody else who goes in hottest Harvard respond to that\nHarvard says there's been no discrimination against Asian American applicants points out Asian Americans now account for twenty three percent of all the students at a higher an event in Detroit last month I caught up with the Harvard new president Larry back out and he defended the colleges admissions process\nNobody wants to be judged on their numbers alone\nHe will understand and recognize that we learn from our differences\nThat creating a diverse learning environment in which is the learning experience for every student on Capitol\nAnd feedback out told me that what's at stake here is Harvard in higher educations ability to create that diverse environment which he says the central to its mission\nAnd Harvard is defending this how I I don't want to stand as just a little bit when we say that that twenty three percent of the student body is Asian the accusation is that Asians would be an even higher percentage if it were not for this personal characteristics test is that right\nRight if you just focus on academics in test scores alone Asian Americans would would would be significant larger proportion of the number of students at at Harvard\nAnd how significant is it correct that the Trump Administration has weighed in in favor of the plaintiffs here\nRight the Justice Department filed a brief in support of the lawsuit saying Harvard's admissions process quote may be infected with racial bias here in Boston judge Allison boroughs who presided over the case she was nominated by President Obama a she's the same judge who blocked President Trump's executive order designed to ban refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly\nMuslim countries she's really known for her independence streak so I don't think she'll be swayed by the Justice Department or the Trump Administration or any other political agenda\nNevertheless a pretty dramatic case Kirk thanks very much thank you Steve Kirk Carapezza W GBH in Boston\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay it's Monday which means we're two days from a big Brexit summit and talks between the United kingdom and the European Union are stalled\nThey are the prime minister of the ... the main is holding a cabinet meeting tomorrow there is a threat that some of the numbers might resign over this political party that's propping up her fragile government at this point says walking away from the European Union with out a deal is quote probably inevitable\nNPR's Frank Langfitt will never walk away for this story and he's on the line from London once again either Frank absolutely nuts so how is this how does go over the weekend\nWell the big problem is we've talked about many times the is is you know how does the u._k. levy without creating a hard border on the island of Ireland and this is so contentious ... working solution is actually just to postpone a solution to kick the can down the road that's your best idea at this point\nAnd have the you can continue to operate inside the use customs area so wouldn't eat customs checks between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland which is of the Northern Ireland of course as a part of the u._k. but to you and you can't can't agree on how long this customs arrangement would expire and that's one of the main reasons that talks collapsed up this weekend\nI guess we should just remember so Britain is still for the moment as part of the European Union which means there are open borders people can travel from place to place they can live\nFrom one place to another and the latest idea is that for at least a little while if the British couldn't get the Europeans to go along they would continue to lead goods move across those borders\nExactly well well at least across the island of Ireland yes and in fact yeah the u._k. would actually stay in the customs union the problem with that though is for breakfast ears they say you know they're afraid that this was going to go on forever and this is actually a way that could undermine the whole idea of wrecks it brings it would never happen\nI'm also they want to be able to get out of the U.S soon as possible because one of their big pitches back in two thousand and a sixteen during the referendum is they would uh cut new trade deals with other countries and this would actually reinvigorate or help the economy here I'm In the United kingdom\nThe bottom line is that um analysts say it may just can't get an open ended cousins arrangement through her own parliament so she's basically having problems in the end problems back here\nWow so we're still in a place where Britain's Theresa May does not have enough of her own conservative party on the same page that she can go to the Europeans and say we're committed to whatever proposal were just brought you\nYeah and that's and that's part of the problem and and and I think particularly the idea of this open ended customs arrangement\nIs just not flying here David Davis he's a former Brexit secretary he resigned earlier not too long ago in road test he's calling for cabinet rebellion against May's plan Northern Ireland is democratic union party\nThere propping up a prime minister May's government they're also against this plan and if they pull out they could cripple the government by refusing to vote on any big bills you wouldn't be able to get anything done\nAnd in Steven ... the prime minister getting consensus on this so far is proving nearly impossible what happens over the next couple of days that\nWell I think what we're going to see is a see how the cap that response tomorrow I mean as they're open dissent to people threatened to resign I think that's the next step\nMay will fly to Brussels on Wednesday um but there are no talks planned between now and then so it seems like it would be much harder to get an agreement there still time left the wants a deal by the end of this year UK scheduled to end a leave at the end of march and there's a possibility the the UK still could leave without a deal\nFrank

day\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin Neil Armstrong\nWas meticulous calculated in the Apollo eleven mission where everything could go wrong Armstrong's thought of every contingency plan but the one thing he didn't prepare for was sitting at the kitchen table to tell his boys he might not make it home\nTo play it in the evening\n\nWhen we're not sure we're going to get on to them\nLot of things have to go right before\nWe have a real confidence in the mission\nRyan Gosling plays the stoic Neil Armstrong and the new film first man it's directed by Damien ... who also did la la land and whiplash\nAnd his first name ... brings new whereas right inside the loud claustrophobic spacecraft they carried a cruel to them or seemingly impossible journey that purged all reckless\nI think it was one thing that struck me the most when I saw some of these aircrafts in space capsules in person was how\nSmall and rickety they looked they looked like a sardine cans you know and and um the technology is so crude looking and so analog I'm so there is a beauty and that and there's also something terrifying and that and I think it actually but by ... by honing in on that uh we really wanted to\nHopefully remind audiences are you know that this was in the sort of gilded easy sleek high tech space travel that um that might have been sold to the public this was a really a hard and dangerous or labor and\nInsanely risky yeah I mean you know they said we're going to go to the moon before they had the technology to do it and they just had faith that they would catch up in time\nAnd the film makes you realize how little the public actually knows about Neil Armstrong the man and this particular loss that you learn about early in the film his infant daughter died of cancer years before he ever went to the man\nI mean it it's this unfathomable tragedy uh but but but in some ways what's even more striking about it is how many people Neal worked with didn't even though he ever had a daughter I mean that's how close to the best he\nHe kept that event he in Janet were fiercely private and um I think in many ways the movie especially as we did more and more research the movie kind of shifted in in my mind and I think in Ryan's mine and all of our minds from\nFrom a you know sort of mission movie about the race to the moon to a movie about grief and and coping and Neal's case a man who suffers such a profound loss that\nIn some ways you understand that his thoughts wind up just go into space go into the broader universe and and uh and maybe searching for answers that he just can't find here on earth\nShe Neil Armstrong in homes portrayed as a man pretty typical of his generation in his ability to compartmentalize his emotions plus that truth him\nI think it was and and um we had to really rely on on people who knew him behind those closed doors people who knew the non public Neal because the public Neal yeah it was pretty reticent I'm pretty uh even seemed to reclusive um of course once you get to the private Neal uh he was a actually a immensely ...\nPull of goofing off he had a really sly sense of humor and a dry wit he was also capable of a of a real you know almost sort of a scary intensity when it came to the passion with which he attacked his work and his passion for aviation I think we wanted to try to get a bad vulnerability that human qualities so that you you know because\nI think he's become and the collective imagination such a\nPoker face to almost marble statues hero but I'm\nThe people like his kids he was just dead you know\nAnd to people in the neighborhood he was you know he's the guy down the street\nSo that you know the movie has gotten some criticism from some on the conservative side of the political spectrum who have taken issue with the fact that the film doesn't show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting the American flag on them in\nSo let me ask you about that was that an intentional or mission [noise]\nUh well you know we we don't um at the American flag on the moon you see it are clearly in several shots and I think this conversation about the sort of a mission has been happening or exclusively among people who haven't seen the film\nSo I'm just really excited that the movies is opening and and that people can start seeing it and see for themselves what um the tribute I guess that we we tried to to\nPay in the movie to what was undeniably an American enterprise and a a group of uh just American heroes I'm the one other thing I'll say though is is that it's it was really important to us to try also to wherever possible focus on\nThe untold story and and things that people didn't see and didn't know and take a very personal subjective angle on these sort of big historical events are in between the things that you read about in the history books and you were actually seen the sort of stuff uh that again hopefully help to tell the human story and help show that you know these were human beings and not a\nMythological figures these were ordinary people doing the\nHeap as we've been talking a became a hero and an icon but you stop the story before we see that happen in the chronology why did you make that choice to to end the film where it ends with him coming back but we don't see him um urge to like the throngs of cheering crowds [noise]\nWell it's a\nUm we we know about the sort of a\nTickertape parades and whatnot um I was really surprised to learn about this time in quarantine that the astronaut spent right after coming back from\nFrom the moon and to get to actually visit that quarantine and see how small and on glamorous bedrooms word that they stayed in and and uh you know those government buildings and\nYou come back from the moon and suddenly you're thrust right into the the epitome of the mundane um and I just found that fascinating and it was this tremendous moment of hope that the entire world was given by the moon landing\nBut also just a reminder of the loss that it took to get there uh it didn't actually feel appropriate maybe is the word to end the movie with just nothing but cheering crowds and and people getting their pictures taken it felt that there had to be some acknowledgement in a way of um just the men's sacrifice and and a loss that will never go away\nBut without which you know we wouldn't have had this tremendous game that the whole world got to benefit from\nAnd he never went up into space again\nNo he didn't um yeah I mean in some ways you know it's ... ... Ryan had an interesting way of of referring to when we were kind of trying to figure out how to frame certain scenes in the movie and in the shooting of them\nHe would talk about how you know to him this wasn't a movie about a guy landing on the moon it was a movie about a guy landed on earth um and it's that journey to actually truly come home in every sense of that word and to land on the ground and to and to be a one with your family it's a much longer journey in a way and the journey to them in\nThe film is called first man we even speaking to that that director Damien says al\nDamian thank you so much thank you so much for having me [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\nW.

from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep when Britain voted on Brexit in two thousand sixteen advocates for that change said there was no downside\nThe u._k. would withdraw from the European Union but the British economy was so big so vital\nThat Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that now is prime minister Theresa May prepares to meet European leaders this week was time running out there is a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering this story in London either Frank\nGood morning Steve how has this story evolving\nWhat's that going very well you know uh basically they were talks over the weekend a dominant ... he's the breakfast secretary flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and they're supposed to the premise you may supposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you're not discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discussed during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across a Ireland the island of Ireland and neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can't agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the EU for a limited time the doesn't want that they were afraid they want a guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks or a stalemate\nAh so what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend the free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion exactly what they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult problem\nTo solve all though you also noted that even that proposal or is not something the Europeans are legal too eager to grab onto\nNo they're not actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of her party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier Brexit tiers they sold this to people in the United kingdom as he was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tie their hands they say they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit fears then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch their armed\nYears who say that to an end even prime minister may has said in the past\n... no ... no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running a and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament there's going to be a cabin\nMeeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk if there would be no ... no deal between the two um and what that would mean certainly the u._k. economy many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous market across the English Channel\nOkay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens to the next day well now we have\nTo see if she'll even fly to Brussels you supposed to fly to Brussels but if there haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering and kind of center on her way she's not going to risk that again\nSo where does still may in time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union and there's not a lot of time left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London\nBoth political parties in this country have a lot at stake this November some Democrats say they're very survival is on the line or for President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress the prize on election night is not just to stay in power but to stay relevant NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirm judges take another whack at Obamacare help President Trump shut down the mother investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a\nSimple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across for that will greatly affect the willingness for some who have been at it for a long time like the ... and whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it won't be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd then was happy Carter speaking with Huffington Post's reporter

the world's largest oil exporter and they've already talked about\nIf there were any sort of sanctions or any sort of a punishment for Saudi Arabia that they will respond with even bigger ones now oil would most likely be some kind of part of that\nAnd that was this editorial that a lot of people have picked up on it came from the general manager of the official Saudi news channel Al Arabiya and in it he says that reality is looking at all kinds of measures\nThat would put pressure on the U.S if the U.S was to think about sanctions these could include an oil production cut and that could drive prices up from\nAround eighty dollars a barrel to more than four hundred dollars a barrel now there's no indication that you know any of this is going to happen but you can imagine that kind of talk is giving the market jitters and it's worrying a lot of people about you know where this might go if it becomes more of a confrontation\nRight and that four hundred dollars a barrel is the in the editorial it's not necessarily what independent analysts are talking\nAbout yeah that's right but it points to the kind of rhetoric that Saudi Arabia is already employing saying look you know first of all we had nothing to do with this but equally if you target us we have the clout to target you\nRemember though that Saudi Arabia messing with its own oil production is also a bit of ... the um

that change said there was no downside\nThe u._k. would withdraw from the European Union but the British economy was so big so vital\nThat Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that now is prime minister Theresa May prepares to meet European leaders this week was time running out there was a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering this story in London either Frank\nGood morning Steve how has this story evolving\nWhat's that going very well you know uh basically there were talks over the weekend a dominant ... he's the breakfast secretary flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and they're supposed to the premise you may supposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you're not discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discussed during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across an eye on the island of Ireland\nAnd neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can't agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the EU for a limited time the he doesn't want that they were afraid they want a guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks or a stalemate\nUs so what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend the free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion exactly what they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult problem\nTo solve all though you also noted that even that proposal or is not something the Europeans are legal too eager to grab onto\nNo they're not an actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of a party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast ears they sold this to people in the United kingdom as it was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tied their hands they say they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit fears then saying OK find great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch\nTheir our breakfast years who say that uh and and even prime minister may has said in the past\nUh no ... no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament is going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk that they would be no ... no deal between the two\nUm and what that would mean certainly to the u._k. economy many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous market across the English Channel\nOkay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens the next day\nWell now we have to see if she'll even fly to Brussels she supposed to fly to Brussels but if they haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering in kind of center on her way she's not going to risk that again [noise]\nSo where does stalemate and time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union and there's not all\nTime left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts happy to do with Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London both\nPolitical parties in this country have a lot at stake this November some Democrats say they're very survival is on the line for President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress the prize on election night is not just to stay in power but to stay relevant NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirmed judges take another whack at Obamacare help President Trump shut down the mother investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power\nTo set the agenda and get bills across for that will greatly affect the willingness for some who have been at it for a long time and I was ... and whether maybe there should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and bold there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it won't be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "15"}
