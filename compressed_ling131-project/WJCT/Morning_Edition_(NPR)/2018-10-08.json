S. but pond pay was very upbeat that real progress on the new North Korean nuke\nIf you could be made it a second summit and perhaps Noone who's a beat it as a Kim Jong un according to North Korean state media he said that he was satisfied with productive in wonderful talks with Pompeo on denuclearization and other issues\nAnd Kim said he was optimistic about the future because he and Trump have deep confidence in each other any idea what\nProgress we're actually talking about when it comes to the nuclear issue\nOkay well the way they phrased it the way the U.S side raises it is that they made progress on implementing the Singapore summit between a Kim Jong un and President Trump 'em and nuclear disarmament is a big part of that\nAre also Kim Jong would when invited international inspectors to go check out\nAs dismantled nuclear test site called ... but really that's not really um that's the U.S doesn't really see that as a disarmament measure it more as a confidence building measures that test site may actually be defunct anyway\nBut new details about the main things that the two sides want North Korea of course wants to formal treaty ending the Korean War the U.S would like to see most of all time line and an inventory of how of what it has in when it's going how it's going to get rid of its nuclear assets\nOkay so then pump ... moves on to China where it sounds like things were not totally friendly\nAnd that's why we don't know exactly what happened in these talks\nBut ah when Pompeo sat down with ... his Chinese counterpart he got an earful Loni said uh you know you're hitting us on on trade on Taiwan and on base was accusations by which I think he was referring\nTo this speech the vice President Pence gave last week which was a bit of very confrontational tone\nIn one said look you come here you want to cooperate with us on the north Korea his shoe that's exactly why we have to avoid confrontation\nSo is that at risk now I mean could could China's cooperation could not be so cooperative on North Korea if if they feel good things for us to do with the U.S\nWell China says it is not abandon the goal of a nuclear free peninsula or it's going to fulfill its international obligations such as un sanctions\nUm but you know Beijing and soul both think that North Korea needs to be rewarded when it makes progress they think it has made progress and they're also both very interested in investing North Korea because they see things sewing on the peninsula and they want to take take advantage of this opportunity\nNPR's Anthony Kuhn in Beijing Anthony thanks sure thing David\nRight\nThere are still no signs of missing Saudi dissident and journalists last week Jim all cause show gay went into the Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul he was never seen coming out\nYet Turkish investigators have now told several news organizations that Chris Yogi is dead they say he was killed by a team of Saudi agents and that his body was

it it it just feels pretty grim right now\nI um I mean Saudi Arabia is obviously denying that the accusations that that they may have killed him but can can you talk about what kind of journalist um he is and why he might be a target of the Saudi Government\nAbsolutely um you know so he's he's been a journalist for about Thirty years\nUm I think what what people should know is that for a long

were some things that needed to be modernized and we we don't dispute that we were pretty concerned though and it was pulled off the table\nSo having farmers are already reeling from tariffs imposed by China which has slashed sales to the largest export market losing fails to Mexico would be another blow\nThe benefit sneak up on ya trade develops slowly over time these things get opened up and then when they shut off then you know what you've lost\nSo he's glad that there's a deal to replace NAFTA even if it just preserves the status quo for soybeans to put it another way he's relieved that negotiations are over rather than rejoicing at the outcome\nJoy lens who farms Wheaton barley in North Dakota feels the same way even though he does see a benefit for wheat farmers in this deal\nBe

people's bank of China also says it's cutting reserve requirements for banks by ... percentage point\nReserves are basically how much banks have to set aside in cash and other liquid assets as a cushion and the thinking is if Chinese banks don't have to keep as much capital on hand they'll anymore\nAnd why is China doing this\nIt may be related to the trade war with the U.S at the Trump
