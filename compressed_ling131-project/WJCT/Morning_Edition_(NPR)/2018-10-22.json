P. eighty nine nine us\nYour community your world\n\nGood morning the U.S wants out of a nuclear deal with Russia to administration accused Russia raking it and President Trump that China take advantage of\nMexican officials talk stopping a caravan of Central American migrants on paper\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep instead the migrants were allowed to pass north work with some hoping to reach us\nAre far behind Republicans in the number of governors but have a shot to capture the governorship\nAlso this hour how Afghanistan's election turned out it's Monday October twenty second this day in Nineteen sixty two\nJohn F. Kennedy told the nation of Soviet\nPete talking to people hear what they say is that this is an opportunity to feel safer on this migrant route so they have plenty of reasons for wanting to flee of violence and poverty and things like that and when they hear a caravan is happening they said this is a really good opportunity for\nTo not be so exposed on this migrant where that is really dangerous and we can we can be a big group and feel safer\nWorth underlining the difference between the soundbites in what James Frederick just reported from there on the ground I'm\nThe president describes hardened criminals the reporter looking at the people describes a mother with three children a mother with four children are and the complexity there is there's a lot to it it's just different than the soundbite although we should underline also they do not have permission to enter the United states\nMonday it and then on the ground reporting came from James Frederick was actually with the care of and in Mexico James we appreciate and\n\nOur President Trump is saying that the United states is going to withdraw from a nuclear treaty with Russia that has been in place now for decades\nNow President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed a treaty in Nineteen eighty seven it's called the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or the eye and half treaty and it banned the two powers from having particular kinds of ground launched ballistic and cruise missiles\nThis cause more than twenty five hundred weapons to be destroyed now in recent years the Obama administration in addition to President Trump's administration have accused Russia of violating disagreement starting back in two thousand fourteen\nThis isn't Obama though decided not to withdraw from the treaty then because some European leaders expressed concerns that that could trigger an arms race\nAnd let's bring in NPR's Lucian Kim NPR correspondent in Moscow Hi Lucy in\nThe morning so what exactly is President Trump's argument here\nWell the Trump Administration is saying that Russia has been cheating for years um as Steve already mentioned Obama already accused President Clinton of testing a new cruise missile that violated the treaty which the Kremlin denied\nSo these accusations have really been around for some time and in fact someone who was criticized them a lot um is of Trump's national security adviser John Bolton and he just arrived in Moscow over the weekend\nAnd he's expected to deliver this message to ...\nOh that's interesting timing so we might hear more about how the two countries are going to talk about this will have the Russians said anything yet to this point after after tremendous announcement\nWell the reaction we've been hearing over the weekend has been quite predictable or sharing officials calling it very dangerous a continuing black male and one of the signatories of that agreement Mikhail Gorbachev\nA said with the withdrawal is not the work of a great mind and that it's a mistake but in fact you know this is not really a huge surprise there recriminations or mutual all Russia has been saying that elements of\nThe American anti missile shield and Eastern Europe\nIs in violation of the INS treaty\nAnd some analysts here in Moscow say that could actually wanted to industry for a long time but he wanted the U.S to be the one to rip it off because there are a lot of other countries first and foremost China that are developing these medium range missiles and Russia doesn't want to be have it's tied ... hands tied in countering those threats\nOh that's interesting so potent wanted this any way it's just that big a deal I mean this is going to have ripple effects or or or not\nWell it definitely has ripple effects I mean it feeds into this Russian argument that the U.S as always taking a unilateral action without consulting anyone else\nThere's really a widespread feeling in Russia that after the Cold War\nThe west and especially the United states didn't do enough to integrate Russia and in some kind of knew over arching\nSecurity agreement so you know in two thousand two of the Bush administration left the anti ballistic missile treaty now we have Trump leaving a the INS treaty and this could endanger the so called new start treaty negotiated by Obama which is up for renewal\nAnd parents will see in Kim in Moscow Lucian thanks as always thank you [noise]\nAnd so in a single day in July of twenty Seventeen the state of Georgia purged more than half a million voters from its voter rolls that's eight percent of registered voters in this state\nWell more than one hundred thousand of those voters were removed from the rolls because of his so called use it or lose a policy that is a policy in Georgia and at least nine other states that eliminates voters for deciding not to vote in some prior elections\nAnd one reason we're talking about this this morning is because Georgia secretary of state who oversees voting and oversees the voter rolls is Brian Kemp and he happens to be the Republican candidate for governor W. A. B. E. Johnny Kauffman is here to talk about this he reported this story along with reveal and eight PM reports\nSay they're Johnny hey they're so tell us why this is significant well this is a\nReally close historic race for governor here right now there's lots of national attention on it and it's kind of seen as this sort of test for the twenty twenty presidential contest\nAnd Brian Kemp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams who would be the first black female governor and the country and her strategy is all about boosting turnout among people of color right\nDemocrats and civil rights groups say to these voters or they don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans and so they say to use it or lose it perjury is disproportionately affect those voters and that\nReally this is a new voter suppression tactic they're Republicans are using to help them when\nIs this an issue that seems to be capturing the attention of voters this election gets closer\nYeah this has become a big campaign issue and uh we went to a small town in southwest Georgia called Moultrie um most people there I ... in the town or black or Latino and turnout is really low\nAnd we spoke to this man and Reverend Cornelius ponder who's on the city council there and he says part of that low turnout on is because of all these obstacles devoting including the purchase so here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the podcast reveal\nIt almost gives people the ... that mindset that that this is a privilege not a right and so now anything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nIs so when it comes to purchase a hunters and actually with someone who was removed for not voting\nShe didn't know at her nephew didn't know it and die her story is kind of that she voted for Obama in two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting off or Abrams but unless she registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and and won't be able to vote and George it doesn't have same day voter registration unlike some other states\nNow you actually spoke to secretary camp the Republican candidate who actually carried out this policy right I mean what what's his argument here\nYet ... says he's just following the law and this is legal the Supreme Court actually approved a policy like this earlier this year or that he said the state sends out multiple notifications before rooms people and that this is in part a way of combating voter fraud\nAnd camp says he has not been more aggressive and purging voters than previous secretaries of state but the numbers show a big jump and people were moved we found one point six million had been removed since he took over\nOkay W. A. B. is Johnny Kauffman along with reveal and a PM reports dug into a purge of more than a hundred thousand voters in\nGeorgia and that has become an issue and in this coming election Johnny thanks a lot for the reporting [noise]\nYou're welcome\nThis is NPR News\nTallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum isn't the political side of his life\nHe's running to be Florida's governor against former Republican representative Ron dissent is polls show them in a dead [noise] can Gillum star power give him across the finish line will meet the mayor next time on one egg\nWeekdays at ten after first post connect on eighty nine nine W.

C.\nAnd I'm David Greene in New York City a group of migrants is focusing fresh attention on the flow of people from Central America\nThey've been labeled a caravan and we're talking about upwards of five thousand people many fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving north and many hope to reach the United states now Mexican authorities spoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are heartened to see a lot of people and I don't want them to address you\nKnow we should say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them either James\nI Do so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan [noise]\nSo I Am and type a true in Mexico right now\nIt's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and ah ended yesterday\nUm people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boys is probably three or four years old or with\nHis parents as their digest sleeping under a little plastic bags here um these people walk more than one two miles yesterday to get here temperatures got about Ninety degrees um season just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\n[noise] yeah and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here\nUm because yesterday I was walking with the caravan though we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police that we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan\nAnd man and a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left and the caravan kept marching so they don't know what's the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet\nSo we've been obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um\nDoes that tell us anything [noise]\nSo so you're right we we\nHave been saying for years people playing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad um you know talking to people about why they're in this chair bound why so many of them have come together\nThey just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because this migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids\nTravelling alone puts you at risk of so many things are cartels and gangs attacking\nYou which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest the best place they can be\nIn of course president so I'm not saying though that they are not going to be allowed into the ...\nIf you're following this reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you\nAmerican voters are choosing more than the U.S Congress this fall they also choose state

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Draine and I'm Steve Inskeep years ago\nThe writer ... a brand new I worked in a clothing store he worked in the holiday season which picks on Black Friday and that experience informs the short story collection he calls friday black\nEyes they brand new book makes its point by exaggerating race and class divisions and consumer culture or\nIs it really exaggeration he spoke with no okay\nYou write in this field of of speculative fiction or dystopian fiction whatever you want to call it but one thing that separates us from other authors I've read in in that genre is that you were writing seems to be explicitly political\nAnd I wonder and as a black writer do you feel that that is partially a responsibility to to have a political take on things\nI don't want to if I could suggest to any black writer has any particular thing they have to do that said I myself do feel compelled to write about certain things um it's pretty much unavoidable that my work um engages subjects that are highly politicized I think that\nMost identities or where they intersect with the culture that they come out of 'em there's this there's politics involved sometimes just existing in space and proudly mildly is somehow political so I think\nUm if you write fiction and anything that's not a vacuum on some level I think it's political and so because no one who writes in a vacuum and no one comes out of a vacuum you're kind of doing some of the political and if you and I think it's a great privilege to think you are not\nMany of your stories are are filled with brutality but there is also a wide vein of dark humor running through some of them which I think might surprise people this story that gives you a book it's title friday black\nThis short story takes place in what we assume is a department store and it's a it's a Black Friday it's the Friday after Thanksgiving which we all know is is kind of a nightmare of consumerism your\nProtagonist as a young man working in the stores selling fleece jackets\nYou have these chest vicious scenes where people consumers shoppers storm\nThe entrance of the store and there are so overwhelmed at the idea of getting a deal that they trample each other they when they trample each other to the point of death they they show bodies out of the way that is a heck of a way to look at at Black Friday what were you saying there\nTo talk about the humor in it for me it's important to\nTry to laugh when you can because\nI think it's healthy but also I think for me it's a way to help me\nSay exactly what I wanted to say because if I don't add some Lebanese um humor I probably won't get through on some level for the reader I think it's like the sugar kelp and medicine go down sometimes\nUm you kinda get through a story where there's like ... this vein of humor and sometimes I think the punch line is it actually it wasn't a joke after all but with on that story friday but I did work in retail I really haven't seen a like a woman step one another woman like cash for genes\nUm we all know for a fact that pretty much a newly someone gets killed because people in Wal Mart or trying to get TVs in my mind the first thing that happened everyone the country the world should have been like whoa whoa whoa whoa\nYou know maybe we've I'm taking this thing too far but it's\nA scary thing for me to think about what's scary I think how how we can know that happens so regularly still sort of ...\nDo they participate yet the main character in that story and friday black as a young man who wants to get the sales record because he will win a prize and the prize is a coat that he intends to give to his mother\nAnd at one point to a colleague it in the unmanned confront them and says you know seeing seeing the body strewn about hearing the yelling and screaming he says this this is just not worth it your mother knows that you love her she doesn't need a cult\nAnd you know what's what's funny about that moment and I didn't have that moment ... ... if you can believe that originally and really like the original draft and I'm surprised I\nYeah and actually I'm prior to the book being called for the blackout a previous title and after I made that editorial change after Ira buys it and made that moment I was finally like okay this\nThis can be the title of the book because you absolutely need that moment to moment of self implication in which the some because they're like you know you think you're not in this but you are and how to use the same line of logic I'm going to participate in this craziness because I'm going to get my mother is facing and the ... and again for me it's important because like I said I really did worked in retail\nThere where the contest is my story that I'm getting more money or something whoever's made the most sales would get from the north face jacket\nAnd I got it from my mom I really did wow I really did do that and um\nYou know I don't know that she wears it any more\nYou are the the sign of of immigrants from Africa from God yes former parents are from Donna\nHow how do you think that informs the way you see race in the United states and in particular racial tension which makes it so much of your book in in the United states\nI'm sure it informs me and a lot of ways I Can't even really perceive you know my parents are they're very decided we um Africa and they got me in\nAnd they would sometimes even ... I had a built in thing that I had to work doing sort of just about you've been my distinction from black Americans which they like you know you're not from here and I don't think you can act like these people here\nAnd because of the way I started doing in Queens New York I was I understood you know block is different and all you know but because of the way back to sort of pride associated with where my parents come from and I didn't have to default to a feeling of\nWhite is the best which I think is really hard to escape and America\nI mean you mentioned something before like some of my characters [noise]\nA lot of them went to ... some of them there or not but in my mind they're all black you know I don't accept the sort of white ... in in the literary world it's almost like if you don't say they're black or white\nI definitely like sort of tried to resist that and especially because in my story sounds often the way their races revealed his do some type of traumatic incidents happening because of their race and I don't want that to be the case where I'm readers are owning feeding characters that are of color\nHaving that matter of fact in some kind of pain of trauma for them\n[noise] none of climbing Ajay ... thank you so much for coming in to talk today we really appreciate it\nI appreciate it thank you so much [noise]\nDo short story collection is called friday block [noise]\nAnd this is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene [noise]\n\n\n\nW.

to decide whether to protect occupants or bystanders and some crashes and artificial intelligence could discriminate against women job applicants a story we covered the other day\nOr the powerful trait in tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers has just come up with a new ethics certification process\nIt's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hurts and his friends parents about the assumptions built in John Havens is executive director of the ice ... artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for coming in\nMy pleasure to be here this is about what a putting human needs first when it comes to autonomous robots self driving technology\nWell I think in general is sort of an idea of the contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's just new things that people have to understand her trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of a self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a vacation process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dart emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and then actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question than some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to actually define them and be aware of them\nAll ethics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek background of ethics whereas when we have the entire other side of the planet and the global south\nHow's things called Confucian ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that's how we come to these questions and so when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety your trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what I ... about consensus building globally\nIs to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask\nJohn ... is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for autonomous and intelligence systems at the height Tripoli he's also author of heart official intelligence that's the word heart there at the beginning embracing our humanity to maximize machine\nGun ... thank you my pleasure\nThat new ethics certification process also addresses wider economic effects\nOf new technology and pushes for

goals and objectives in the region of the fight against violent extremism confrontation with Iran\nOr maybe progress on the Israeli Palestinian account uh so uh so they've been depend to a lot uh the

C.\nAnd I'm David Greene in New York City a group of migrants is focusing fresh attention on the flow of people from Central America\nThey have been labeled a caravan we're talking about upwards of seven thousand people many of them fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving northward and many hoped to reach the United states now Mexican authorities spoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are heartened to see people and I don't want them you\nKnow we should say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them Hi there James ... so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and ah ended yesterday um people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm\nYou know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boy who's probably three or four years old\nOr with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here um these people walk more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got above Ninety degrees um so you can just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\n[noise] yeah and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here\nUm because yesterday I was walking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police so we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left\nAnd the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet so we've\nBeen obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to the states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um does that tell us anything\n[noise] so ... you're right we we have been saying for years people in countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is\nThe bad there you know poverty is also really bad um you know talking to people about why they're in this caravan of why so many of them have come together they just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because\nThis migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids travelling alone put you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest and best place they can be\nOkay and of course president from now saying though that they're not going to be allowed into the country is a lot of uncertainty for the group you're following that's reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you\nAmerican voters are choosing more than the
