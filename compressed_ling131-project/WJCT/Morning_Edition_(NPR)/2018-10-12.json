service which is so vital because many say they haven't talked to anybody since they've the storm hit so they can't let their friends and their relatives know that they came through it all safely\nMy goodness NPR's Greg Allen thanks so much Greg and stay safe we'll do\nOur\n\nPresident Trump will be campaigning for Republicans this weekend and he will visit eastern Kentucky the president will be in the congressional district some from which a MORNING EDITION team is reporting this morning\nYeah we're in Lexington, Kentucky after spending days listening to voters including Alan ... who is editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creeks courier and he will be at the Trump rally\nI was actually a Trump voter was and I my vote for him again I'm going to read from the same as we can or maybe I won't get show\nMaybe I won't get shot he says halls he is deciding if people support the president's favorite congressional candidate the incumbent anti bar now ... conservative but says he also prefers divided government Kentucky is arrests\nBut also a state where teachers protested a Republican governor this year and Audrey Long is one of those who held up signs at the state capital we talked over dinner\nIn Lexington did those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they would\nHave oh heck yeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office in this year than ever before\nNow we've met dozens of people in three corners of this district to poor rural county an upscale horse tracking lend\nAt a historic black neighborhood now we're going to talk over what we found was Emily bowl you was a political science professor at the University of Kentucky good morning welcome coming out I guess we should just mentioned we have a few friends with your room wagon bikes and coffee what'd you let the country know your your guys\n[noise]\nAll right let's just ask about this district were in the sixth district what would make this district competitive and such a red state\nWell that's interesting so historically Kentucky follows the pattern of other southern states in not\nEven as the state's trend did I'm Republican National level particularly for presidential elections Democrats retain strong control at the state level and so we've seen um districts like the ... able to\n... back and forth we've got some more conservative Democrats something else going on here as well we're in a very modern an urban place in a city and an increasingly diverse place the teacher we heard from teachers English as a second language and get students coming from all over the world a Lexington, Kentucky yeah\nIs there a divide between rural and urban in a place like this if we just drive an hour to the east in the mountains I feel like we're in a very different world\nThan it is well you have different types of rural here in Kentucky right we have the um horse industry which brings a certain type of rural and then we have as you move further East I'm more I'm impoverished from coming\nIn as places where you've got small Hallows as they call them small farms or or nothing particularly going on and tremendous problems with drugs and and other issues that there's an economic divide as well right this is a very prosperous city that were in ... and a place of education how big a place to the University of Kentucky holding this or not that you're biased rented\nNot at all the University of Kentucky is the is the largest industry here in Lexington um along with\nSuppliers like Toyota manufacturers like Toyota and Lexmark and the bourbon industry\nOh no the bourbon industry that's really interesting isn't that industry being affected by terrorists President Trump imposes tariffs and you now have Europeans imposing tariffs on Kentucky bourbon there are concerns about the terrorists yeah so how are the candidates navigating these divides we have Andy Barr Republican we have Amy McGrath a Democrat running for office for the first time\nSo any McGrath is definitely appealing to that more centrist democratic tendency that we see here I'm trying to emphasize some of the economic issues\nAnd how does Andy Barr pushback\nBy questioning the extent to which McGrath is a center is\nOkay and one final question how popular does it feel to you that President Trump is in the state of Kentucky\nIt depends on who [laughter]\nDeeply divided but he did receive sixty two percent of the voting and sixty eight percent of the ... congressional district I think everybody volume of University of Kentucky thanks so much\n\nAlready looking ahead to the weekend on Sunday nearly forty years after he was assassinated while saying mass Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero will be canonize by the Vatican\nRaises and\nArchbishop Romero constantly spoke against the violence that was tearing his native El Salvador apart in the Nineteen seventies he's\nRadio broadcasts demanding social justice reached hundreds of thousands of people but his words also angered the country's military rulers and the IRS Danny hey Jack is with me he's one of our producers at MORNING EDITION he's been reporting on Romero morning to any hey no what did you learn about Oscar Romero\nWell he was a fighter for justice and they called him the voice of the voiceless this was a time when El Salvador's military regime which was supported by the United states killed kidnapped and tortured civilians many of them the poorest in society\nAnd so Romero ran this commission that investigated human rights abuses and every Sunday during mass he named victims of murder and the countless who disappeared\nAnd it was incredibly dangerous for him to do that I'm In his family's were broadcast on the radio and they became sort of like\nA newscast for the poor mom I talked with Franciscan brother of ... and he used to work at the Catholic radio station in San Salvador\nEverybody everybody was listening\nIncluding his enemies and he had many enemies who are they\nEl Salvador's oligarchy um the military or they were threatened by Romero because he openly talked about these injustices and he empowered the poor\nTo do something about it and he died for that I'm In march of Nineteen eighty well he was saying mass at this little hospital chapel in San Salvador he was shot at the altar by a gunman from right wing dust what\nWhy did it take almost forty years for Romero canonized\nWill remember has always been controversial especially within the Catholic Church I supported the poor he was critical of the government so he was accused of being a communist which he was not um but his costs for seen had was stopped by the Vatican for years because of that\nA Vatican official said he was too aligned with the theology that promoted to cause for social justice but Pope Francis finally change that\nAnd this is huge for El Salvador it's a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world so Oscar Romero was words are just as relevant now as they were thirty eight years ago\nA fascinating man and some fascinating reporting NPR's Danny hey Jack Denny thanks so much thank

campaigns in the district this weekend and those who will be in the audience include Allen halls the editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creek courier\nThat was actually a Trump voter was and on my vote for him again I'm going to read from the same as we can or maybe I won't get shot\nHe leans conservative though he also says he prefers divided government checks and balances which makes his congressional vote ...\nThis is a time of political ferment in Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state capital included Audrey law\nDid those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they\nWould have oh heck yeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office in this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily ball you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS\nJournalism professor at the same university morning guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought is this district between Eddie bar the incumbent David McGrath Democrat\nThere couldn't be any harder fault I mean it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just a one for the books\nMoney being spent how much money are we talking about here\nWell Amy McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\n... ... is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy Barr also had\nAny bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nBow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district you absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads in bars and restaurants and online ads to you can ignore that absolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with\nIs Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors this attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nAnd the ball I went to the majority of black cool\nUm I mean I I dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm\nRacist by any means and I never thought anything\nNothing like I I went to a majority black college it's one of the only white girl on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs this kind of part of the reason you support President Trump 'cause he kinda as you see your calls BS out all this and you kind of agree with that\nKind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't I feel like a lot of people have made issues and things that aren't really is you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions of the state\nI think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divides in the country it looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south or the east and so\nTo the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization from the African American and Latino communities because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here across we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American ah waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago was teaching English as a second language to emigrate immigrants as just becoming a more diverse state has to\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits are those the Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky a article which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states how\nReal than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand what this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by\nIt to me this is again a reflection of um Donald Trump's emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in threat often that's been racialized right quite often it's addressed um toward immigrants and the threat posed by immigrants\nBut there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state I'm a the a racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nIf you look at the exit polls and ... and they have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace no they said that race was a ... was ran into a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black population\nWell let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east in April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the Houston\nWe met her outside a farmer's market to choose help to get going near historic theater there so she's very

leave\nAnd the other person I talked to have surgery scheduled but of course that's been postponed now in the hospital he was going to be in his than evacuated\nSome say this day because with a

for the sparring sessions between the White House press secretary and the media\nBut in recent months those briefings have become less frequent to the point where calling them daily would not be

many times where I Would have been happy to just remind briefing against the marshes\nBut he didn't instead he showed up in the briefing room and feel that the incoming\nIt just felt like it was a responsibility you know sort of a democratic duty and\nNo one from the Trump White house would go on the record for that story and Sanders hadn't been to the lectern in eight days so there hasn't been a chance to ask at the briefing but former press secretary Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all and end all and the standard bearer for the degree of accessibility is rather silly in this age\nAnd he argues that when the briefing became a rating sensation in the Trump Administration its utility decreased\nDynamic and the purpose of the briefing has shifted from reporters using it to gather information to reporters using it to further their own personal careers and name right\nBefore the start of the Trump Administration to former press secretary McCurry and Ari Fleischer argued that to turn down the temperature the briefings shouldn't be live televised events that met with a lot of resistance from the press corps and didn't happen\nFleischer who was press secretary for George W.

causal relationship\nWise the fed tightening because the economy is is doing well in fact\nIt's doing so well that corporate profits are at all time highs and the wages are going up and we're actually looking at possible inflation and therefore the fed just wants to take a little bit of heat out of the economy so it can continue on a sustainable pace\nSo that's the ... part of the brain

Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University of more than guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought is this district between Eddie bar the incumbent David McGrath a Democrat\nIt couldn't be any harder fault I mean it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties or see in it or it's just a one for the books money being spent how much money are we talking about here well McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nEight million dollars isn't amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy\nBarr also had any bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district you absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads for bars and restaurants\nAnd online ads to you can ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to the majority of black cool [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean I I dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm\nRacist by any means and I saw anything\nNothing like I I went to a majority black college is one of the only white girl on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs it kind of part of the reason we support President Trump 'cause he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that\nKind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't feel like a lot of people have made issues and things that aren't really is you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nWell I think what's more important to recognize that doubt this state\n[noise] how overwhelmingly white it as Frank said it's about eighty four percent white ... in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divides in the country it looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south for the east\nAnd sell to the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization\nFrom the African Americans um and the king of communities because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here Al Cross we in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American or waiters in\nWolf county Kentucky but the teacher we heard from a moment ago was teaching English as a second language to emigrate in versus just becoming a more diverse state just and\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population as a single digits or\nSo as a Hispanic populations ah and ah ah eastern Kentucky I'm already which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states for how\nReal then gives the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively father fire\nIt's to me this is again a reflection of on Donald Trump's emphasis train thing in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict and Frank often that stand racialized right quite often it's addressed um toward immigrants in the front has like immigrants\nBut there's there's definitely a racialized I wanted to ask about cross\nIn this state um or the or racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of ... was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic friends in Kentucky to look at the exit polls and two thousand and I we have about a Fifteen Percent\nTechnologist racist electric vehicles say everybody knows that they said that race was a poll was ran as a reason for my\nVote and yeah there would have been some African Americans in that but very few because we've only got Seventy five percent black population\nWell let's hear from a person who
