our MORNING EDITION\nQuid Haley's departure give national security adviser John Bolton more influence over America's relationship with the U.S I'm David great\nTrump announced his plans to link on ethanol in gasoline that may help Iowa more\nCourt justice camera and playing out in the west Virginia Senate race\nBut um there's people are taking it seriously I'm at that but this storm is going to

punishing and the storm surge\nInterest rate down awaiting the arrival of hurricane Michael in Tallahassee Thanks Greg You're welcome\n[noise]\nLike when the UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced on Tuesday that she was leaving her post the news really came as a surprise\nYeah but the oval office announcement with President Trump had all the indications of a well planned event it was cordial dignified Nikki Haley laying out the reasons for her departure\nI got an hour for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year friday's shooting a school shooting of a lot and then they come in and say here's our Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years in tax time and I'm a believer in time on that\nAnd I'm like a number of other races and White House personnel changes Haley seems to be partying on good terms with the president\nShe's done a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we've solved a lot of problems and one of the process of solving a lot of problems\nI Want to bring in NPR White House correspondent Mara Liasson Hi there Mara Hi David ... two years is actually a pretty long time for this administration right I mean this has been a White House full of turmoil hum what what might the impact of this departure B\nWhile the impact of this departure on the administration's foreign policy I think will be minimal the UN ambassador doesn't make foreign policy and I think that the secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the new national security adviser John Bolton already were strong voices on foreign policy and I think now they just get even more so\nSo why the timing of this I mean should we believe failing in saying that it's just been a really intense eight years and she thinks that she should be term limited and might want to take a break\n[noise] no I'm the she\nLooked she not only as you pointed out was one of the very few administration officials who left on her own terms she was not fired by tweet\nBut also the timing of this was impeccable Nikki Haley is probably the most adept politician and the Trump cabinet\nShe left on her own terms she wrote the letter to President Trump saying she wanted to leave about a week ago that was right in the middle of winter Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford wouldn't have looked good if she'd resigned right then but\nShe wanted to step down now even though she's staying till the end of the year she wanted to announce her departure now rather than after the midterms because if the president and his party gets lacked and a lot of people start bailing out it doesn't wind up she doesn't want to look like she's\nA rap deserting the sinking ship and she's been really successful unlike any other Trump cabinet official at\nCreating her own political persona her own Brandt independent\nA loyalist but not a sick event and you know she announced in an op ed piece recently two things one that she wasn't anonymous the secret resistor and number two that she did disagree with Trump from time to time but\nOften did it privately sometimes she did it publicly she was tougher on Russia than he was she wants said that the women who were accusing Trump of sexual misconduct deserved a hearing she was able to do all that and still maintain good relations with the president\nAny idea who's going to replace her well\nA lot of names are being floated the president said Dina Powell former a top Trump White House Foreign policy aide current Goldman Sachs executive is on the list he talked about Ivanka his daughter ...\nWho who is he said was highly competent but would open himself up to charges of nepotism von ... we did later that she would not be taking the job so there are a lot of people on the list\nWill be watching NPR White House correspondent Mara Liasson talking about how his departure at the un thank so much Mara\nThank you [noise]\nOr more details are emerging now about the disappearance of a Saudi journalist or more cars show in Turkey\nRight to show he is a Washington Post contributor who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey eight days ago the post says that it has been told by persons with knowledge at the Turkish investigation into his disappearance\nThat a team of Fifteen Saudi men flew into assemble early on October second hours before the show he was last seen as he entered the costs like the team checked into to nearby hotels and then were taken to the consulate by car\nAnd the post is also reporting the Fifteen men departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to both Cairo and Dubai NPR's Peter Kenyon has been following all of his in his stumble Hi Peter how David so what is standing out to you at this point is more information is coming in well\nAt this focus on the fifteenth Saudis who arrived to Turkish paper today are published both their names and their photos all Fifteen of them\nAre these are the men police say arrived in assemble last Tuesday the day ... disappeared a there are a media reports that Turkish intelligence says now identified as some of those men as military officers special forces member and a forensic expert among them\nA Turkish TVs aired footage of a black van that was seen leaving the Saudi consulate uh sometime after the show the entered a\nAirport security reportedly X rayed the luggage of at least some of these Saudi men as they prepared to leave the symbol let's same night are they also X rayed the men themselves kind of standard procedure and reportedly at the request of Turkish intelligence they also searched one of the planes are they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off\nBut clearly the focus is on these men and what they were doing here that day\nWhen there were two planes go right to that they've only searched one of the planes that the less\nThat's right that is a gap at the moment in the story that I'm getting a no explanations as to why one plane was searched and not the other uh there are a number of anonymous tips going out providing other sometimes grisly details in support of this conclusion that preliminary conclusion that ... was killed\nA one official tells the New York times at one of the Saudis who arrived last Tuesday was an autopsy expert and that a bone so it was used on the body after the murder\nSo where does the investigation go from here I mean Saudi Arabia is denying anything terrible happened here what ... what a Turkish investigators do now\nWell there's two leading theories obviously one that he was spirited out of the country or that he was killed and his body disposed of police seem to be leaning toward the ladder theory at the moment\nAs you say the Saudis deny any involvement or they want to know where to show give themselves they say they can't provide any evidence to back up their claim that he left the consulate within our of arriving which is what they claim there's no CCTV footage they say Turkish police are going through their own camera footage from the streets outside the consulate\nThey haven't seen any images of to show the leaving TV is airing pictures of him entering though the first we've seen those uh and they will be searching the consulate building with Saudi permission or that could happen as early as today\nAnd Peter remind us of the diplomatic contacts here I mean Saudi Arabia turkey ... what does that relationship like and how badly this damage it well\nIt wasn't great before a turkey has been siding with Qatar in an ongoing dispute with the Saudis are so far president aired ones being cautious he says we need answers but the main secular opposition party is already calling for an immediate review of Turkey's relations with Saudi Arabia\nSo I think however this plays out it will be to some degree a worsening of touch\nAnd then one of the big question to sell to us relations and how that could be impacted as well\nYeah very unclear at the moment are lots of headlines here quoting Trump saying he doesn't know anything about the show became so some level of frustration but no sign so far the Washington's exerting pressure in Riyadh\nAll right NPR's Peter Kenyon in

Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited you Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol\nDoing this could crop of corn prices up and down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are hopes to have it completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision of doing all the Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nUm ethanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we'll use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation said the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no relief that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will do over any change through the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight I'm I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agricultural manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with\nThis new NAFTA deal or as it's called us in the a as well as other trade deals kind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that looked pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes\nA Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred Hubble she was at the event\nAnd the president she worked changing plenty of complements with each other so the Republican congressman who represents the district David Young with also at the rally he faces a tough race as well\nIn the summer youngest said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and he seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against this myth that what you said that there are some politicians who are posing\nWell certainly the politicians are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the the future in energy they're more interested in and oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it\nI think you only one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality state is getting more dominated by Republicans and he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey\nBut there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help mentioned on election day here's West Virginia Public Radio's David message\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled shame from the galleries\n[noise]\nShe's been doing it on order and\nBy that evening assigned saying shame on mansion hung over mansions office back in West Virginia state Capitol Charleston\nIn the run up to the vote Jamie Miller was arrested while protesting at his campaign office Miller who's an artist also went to Washington with a group of sexual assault survivors to meet with mansion she says he was a tenant and listen to their concerns but after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you do when election day\nI didn't vote for him um during the primary but\nI have voted for him in the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do turn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognized that mentioned is new liberal but his defended him in the past I have been\nA person who has been the person to say to someone that we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than\nHis opponent but after Kavanaugh's confirmation Ireland so she won't vote for mansion in November Emily ... came to a similar decision she's a public school teacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion ... shall leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Morrisey either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that is going to fight for us\nWeekday evenings that say I'm eighty nine nine ... the [noise]\n\n\nThe world's leading scientists believe we have about a decade to manage climate change I'm Joshua Johnson can we find a fix and can we fix it fast next time on one day\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in the Nineteen thirties or New York prosecutor brought down lucky Lucy on now than it tore as head of the New York myself yeah\nIt made the prosecutor Thomas Dewey a household name and set him up for a career in politics less remembered as the staff lawyer who made it possible an African American woman named Eunice Carter\nAnd her story is the subject of a new book that is called invisible the forgotten story of the black woman lawyer who took down America's most powerful mobster aspire grandson the law professor and prolific writer Stephen Carter who told Steve Inskeep that he knew his grandmother growing up it was never told about her accomplishments she did all these\nThings she was a prosecutor for years she was a big power Republican politics for a long time and yes I grew up without knowing any of that but knowing it now I think the story is quite a remarkable and\nI Want to underline that named Thomas Stewart people know it's because of the famous false headlined Dewey defeats Truman he was a presidential candidate was supposed to win in Nineteen forty eight and last but before that was a noted prosecutor in New York City what was the task he was set to in the Nineteen thirties\nSo in Nineteen forty five New York experienced what the press called the runaway grand jury when a local grand jury refused to work anymore the corrupted district attorney's office will just make no effort to break up organized crime\nSo the governor of New York for the New York just returning to choose a special prosecutor ended up being Thomas Dewey and his job was to clean up organized crime in New York\nBy hiring people who've never been prosecutors who never got involved with the prosecutor's office which are seen as entirely corrupt so we hired what he called the twenty against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice quarter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to me in a time of such prejudice that first that your grandmother became a lawyer that she became a successful lawyer and then that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen\nWe don't know exactly why you hired her but higher her he did the downside was that after Dewey hired her he set about again trying to investigate ... but do we want it to investigated for murder\nOr some ... what do you considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman and only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a narrow crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers are trying to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Lucy on oh where did she began\nAfter Eunice was hired she was banished in a sense to the for the cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these mice are coming in and they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they were all dumped on union says there's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation but she didn't want to hold her back in fact from that\nShe actually put together the first evidence anyone had ever had the mob was involved in prostitution because it was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded in proving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nSomething like that once she began together the evidence she persuaded Dewey to arrange a police raids which ... was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night\nThey brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... was it was a reason they arrested only the women because the women\nWere accustomed being bailed out by these men called the Sixers but the rest of the Sixers too there was no one to bail them out but it was to keep the women's they would turn against the fixers then to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses will turn against their bosses and hope to only turn against a Lucy I don't know ... everyone's surprise\nUnisys idea worked wow and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana were prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with\nWas a woman known as Cokie flow brown read she was noticed Cokie flow was because of her cocaine habit or when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Lucy on several times discussing with the prostitution business with his aides\n[noise] she was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times what for interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy ... to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on his lawyer\nDemanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony\nSo kooky flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice because Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team and Lucy on his team had no women so she was there when the doctors examine term return to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony was the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise] so how\nDoes learning this story changed your understanding of New York city and the Nineteen thirties or America the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nOne to take away from it is how similar in a sense America then was to American now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of Nineteen forty five which began in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it'd be written the day it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of black people as they go into stores are talks about employment discrimination\nAll the sorts of things that people talk about today but at the same time I think part of our forgotten history\nIs that there were people who are against all odds in that era and even earlier made really remarkable lives for themselves but there were people who built\nA society or with in the segregated world in which they could live and move and have their being as the Santa wonderful lives even at a time when so many evidence we're close to them\nStephen

Yogi in Turkey\nSo gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post says it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into the disappearance this team\nOf fifteenth Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the cuts with the post is also reporting those Fifteen men departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point is you learn more facts here\n[noise] uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper a described him in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of them in some they say are military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nA Turkish TV meanwhile are airing footage of ... entering the consulate on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later\nA heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night uh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were\nDoing here why search for one of the two points on that both the planes\nWell that's a all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's it's not clear why that would be the case\nIt what officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details or one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert and let a bone so it was used on the buddy after the murder\n... a bone saw hum talk of an assassin assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that that is indeed was a targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that ... was spirited out of the country or I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet at the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left to constantly within an hour of arriving\nBut they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up Turkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the ... uh they say so far they've seen footage of him going\nAnd but no footage of him coming out uh they've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission and that we're told could happen as early as today uh there's no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where that black men when eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabia and turkey weren't the best of friends right but what what could I mean if if indeed this journalist was killed on Turkish soil and the Saudi Government something to do with what could this sort of the relationship between the two countries\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut their side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is\nA beyond the pale of anything that would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a Turkish media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration a big one says quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure in Riyadh\nCause for us investigators to join the probe are happening uh we'll see anything like that occurs NPR's Peter Kenyon thanks Peter ... thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company in the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at ExxonMobil had announced that the company will contribute one million dollars of the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution will support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg bird will send them to climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon so brutal ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nBurleson says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing pong and which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions turtles and says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nTwenty forty five\nAmong other things the questionnaire explores your

get deeper into fall is the decline of China's currency the yuan the renminbi if you prefer is down again this morning six point nine to to the dollar but look up for seven to the dollar which we haven't seen\nSince the depths of the great recession ten years ago started a veteran China watcher Shawn Ryan in Shanghai he's managing director of the China market research group\nChina has manipulated its currency called the renminbi to drop about nine percent in value over the last few months and the government is doing that to offset the ten percent of terrorists that Trump has slapped on about two hundred billion US dollars worth of imports and that's why exports\nAre expected to grow about eight point nine percent in September from China and to the United states\nRight so the ten second economics lesson is when China's currency gets weaker you should make Chinese product easier to buy for Americans yet if we go down to the store this Christmas that may not be what we are going to see here in the U.S\nAmerican companies have to buy from Chinese manufacturers it's very difficult for companies like apple to transfer their production from China to other countries so what's happening is higher prices coming out of China are causing higher prices in Walmart and in the dollar store\nShawn Ryan is managing director of the China market research group thank you thank you\nWe should do the Chinese officials deny engineering the currencies declined nor has the U.S label China a currency manipulator numbers the folks here in London is unchanged dominance and the futures are also little change\nOr global some is on mental health wraps up in London today a bit to get funding and treatment options for behavioral medicine more on par with other health issues globally mental disorders are estimated to cost governments in society nearly two and a half trillion dollars every year marketplaces Tracey Samuelson has more\nGetting sick with say cancer can be really expensive to treat but most of that expense will be hospital based says to to pass a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of public health with mental health the costs are often indirect like not being able to work\nOnly forty percent of adults who have a mental illness reported receiving any sort of service for their mental illness in the prior twelve months and that number dropped to below Fifteen Percent and low and middle income countries\nTreatment might be limited due to a shortage of trained mental health workers or this stigma of mental illness often carries Patrick Oregon is a professor of psychology at the Illinois Institute of technology\nThe stigma is probably a bigger problem is a mental illness\nAnd despite our educated we are there's pretty good evidence is getting worse\nOrgans has another reason why mental illness can be so costly is because it often effects younger people\nIn their prime working here I'm Tracey Samuelson\nMarketplace morning report

that you have to be thinking about social and back\nUh yes I think one of the key things is the great companies are thinking about how are we transform the world how we making the world better and that's both ups and downs and one of the things that we have a whole chapter on this and the book is that as your scaling really fast to actually running this past weekend on the road be thinking about which possible risk taking that you need to mitigate\nPossible risks because there are unintended consequences of this technology you know I I'm thinking of Mark Zuckerberg who I think is a

confirmation hearings that have gone um I I Would say relatively smoothly meaning Democrats express their concerns or their opposition we take a vote um nobody notices outside of the foreign policy establishment\nThe reason that justice Kavanaugh's confirmation was so fraught um was not the fight over his jurisprudence it was the credible allegations of sexual assault a and the fact that he now will suffer\nThe conservative majority a possibly for decades to come\nSenator Chris Coons Democrat of Delaware a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a thanks so much for your time we always appreciate senator that you do and I want to turn to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson who has been listening to this Hi Mara Hi David so Nikki Haley I'm\nOne of the few members of this administration has publicly disagreed with a President Trump ... how did that affect your relationship with the White House and and did that play a role it on her departure here\nWell it doesn't seem like it she was very politically adept she was able to disagree with the president on some things publicly she wants even said that the women who are accusing Trump of sexual misconduct deserved a hearing\nBut uh she managed to craft a political persona for herself was which was as a loyal member of the Trump cabinet but not a second fan you know she said she different from him she was tougher\nRhetorically on Russia but that's true of most of the president's national security team compared to him\nUm she did speak out about human rights you just heard senator Coons talk about that but I don't think Nikki Haley was an outlier so much as she was able to use a maybe the distance between Washington and New York city a as a way to develop a more independent\nPolitical brand for herself and can I just ask your\nMom and you're listening to senator Coons there that this whole question of how Democrats should approached this president I mean they have a base that they want to fire up they don't want to be seen as just being anti Trump nothing else I'm here's a senator who you know post Haley came around to say she's done good things what position as this party and right now\nWell it's waiting to see what position it's going to be after the elections I mean that's the big question going forward will Democrats have more cloud in the Senate will they take the majority well they have more seats will they be able to uh exert more influence on the\nConfirmation process we don't know that yet but what I think Senator Cruz was trying to explain is on certain things like a Supreme Court justice that changes the balance of power on the court they exert themselves as much as they can on other nominations they approve the president's pick\nNPR's Mara Liasson Mara thanks

C. American farmers have had a tough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute\nBut last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nMan this shit is for the acting ethanol alright [noise] way our unleashing the power of the Fifteen to\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa ... good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on ethanol\nSo last night the president laid out his intend to extend the sale of all kinds of gasoline called E. Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could prop up corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHope to have a completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that it was\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation said the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said the release that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change do the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term\nTexans are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here right I'm\nI mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals\nKind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that look pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds uh she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of compliments with each other also the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and he\nSeemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against this myth though you said that there are some politician to opposing\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in an energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it\nYeah I think you only one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mentioned faces a political reality state is getting more dominated by Republicans and he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey\nBut there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going

into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the costs with the post is also reporting those Fifteen men departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn his stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point is you learn more facts here\nAnd uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police they arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper a describe them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of them in some they say are military officers including a special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nTurkish TV mean wells are airing footage of ... entering the consulate on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later\nA heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night\nUh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service searched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy switch from one of the two points on that both the ...\nWell that's all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's not clear why that would be the case\nWhat officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert and let a bone so it was used on the buddy after the murder\n... a bone saw talk of an assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that this was a targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet the Saudis of course denied any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left the consulate within an hour of arriving\nBut they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up Turkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the ... they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nThey've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today there's no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence or where the black men when eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabian turkey weren't the best of friends right but what could if indeed this journalist was killed on Turkish soil in the Saudi Government something to do with it well because it's sort of the relationship between the two countries\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut their side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is a beyond the pale of anything\nAnd ... and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do deny it completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more put to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes ah the Turkish media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration of big ones is quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure on Riyadh\nCause for us investigators to joined the pro are happening uh let's see if something

resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon though bird will soon as group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurden since says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on his main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is
