recover most investor losses what\nIs going on NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley is a good person to try to answer that either Scott good to be with you is the ... what is affecting the stock market what pushed it down what pushed it up well\nYesterday there was some solid economic news from the federal government showing the labor market still in good shape with a lot of job openings we also got some better than expected earnings reports from big companies like Johnson Johnson and Goldman Sachs\nAnd perhaps there was also just a feeling that last week slide had been something of an overreaction uh so you have a little less anxiety on\nOr could this week but uh some considerable anxiety from\nThe president of the United states who has been complaining about the Federal Reserve he appoints the chairman of fed up but it is an independent agency they'd been raising interest rates their job is to balance inflation unemployment as well as the cat doesn't like what they're doing area speaking to Fox Business news last night\nIs the fed because the fed is raising wage too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because you looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nNot happy with what he's doing that's Jerome Powell his own man at the fed it's interesting Scott he says my biggest threat I suppose if you're a president and thinking about your eventual reelection you wouldn't want the fed to push the country into recession\nAnd interesting here Steve the presidents obviously an equal opportunity said critic he calls the Federal Reserve loco and out of control when stocks are falling as they were last week and\nHe's just as vocal in his criticism about rising interest rates when stocks rebound as they did yesterday\nYou did hear him not there to the feds independence saying he hasn't taken his criticism to Jay Powell a directly\nBut some observers including pals predecessor Janet Yellen say the Fed's outs of say the president's outspokenness on this could make the Fed's job harder certainly the fed has been very transparent and telegraphing its plan to raise interest rates but that does raise costs for debtors\nIncluding the federal government who's deficit balloon to the last twelve months by Seventeen percent and is on pace to hit a trillion dollars in the coming year\nOh well let's talk about that because Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader Senate Republican leader has been discussing that are suddenly concerned about the deficit let's listen to him talking to Bloomberg\nMature disturbing it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid\nUm excuse me are those are the things that have increased the deficit recently Scott Horsley\nNo those are certainly big parts of the federal budget but the immediate cause of a spike in the deficit is the GOP tax cut a corporate tax receipts last year plunged by thirty one percent and a boost in both military and domestic spending including interest on the debt\nIs there something familiar here Democrats have said this is the essential Republican playbook you cut taxes that increases the deficit and then you say oh my goodness I'm worried about the deficit time to cut entitlement programs\nYes and and Democrats were very critical saying that McConnell was playing by that play book and his comments yesterday worth noting that President Trump campaigned saying he would protect Social Security and Medicare

Ebola infections has come to the Democratic Republic of Congo\nAnd that's why this latest outbreak of Ebola has killed at least two dozen people in the last week and it's now threatening to spread the Congo's neighbors Rwanda and you've gone to the world Health Organization plans to meet today to determine whether this current outbreak rises to a public health emergency of international concern\nOkay those are just words but they could meet a lot of especially since health officials are trying to find out how to fight this disease you know war torn country NPR's resides in men is covering the story good morning good morning so supposedly go ahead and declare a public health emergency what does that mean in practical terms well\nIt's mostly a symbolic sounding the alarm but it's it's particularly effective way of galvanizing public awareness it's a way to rally international support and focus and even action for things like funding for example\nAnd it's worth noting that the Daily Show has only declared this kind of emergency on a four times\nSince the start of this alert system I'm most recently in twenty sixteen Wednesday corrupted in Latin America\nAnd then before that on during the twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen Ebola outbreak in West Africa that are infected twenty eight thousand people\nOkay that was an appalling outbreak uh is something happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo the risks rising to that level\n[noise] well one of the the key issues is that this particular outbreak is taking place in a part of the country where there has been fierce fighting between rebel groups and the government and there's been an uptick in attacks\nBy rebel groups on on government forces on peace keepers and also on civilians um and ah and what's happened is that people who for years had felt abandoned by their their government and international community because of these attacks\nUm started to turn against the health workers I'm sort of seeing them as a you know an arm of the government that is not protecting them from the violence\nWow so it is not just that it's difficult for health workers to get into a chaotic place or a generally unsafe place they themselves had been targets in recent months\nSo it's not so much yeah at the health workers had been targets by the rebel groups but it's that the population has started to this trust or the health workers um so and and I should say it's you know a small group of people I mean overwhelmingly the population is cooperating we've had\nSeventeen thousand people more than that um who have taken this experimental vaccine um\nBut you know there are these pockets of resistance where you have people who um you know there were rumors that the vaccinators are actually part of a plot to split spread the disease and um or you'll have safe burial teams come in and I'm\nIn a one or two times a week um there'll be an attack on the safe burial team um and then you know when

turn now to\nRecent developments in the economy because there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he called the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal morning David governing\nSaid the president has colorfully criticized the fed before but calling their the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new\nUm he's critique is that they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates to muck so far after\nAll the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though unemployment is at a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up but I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go too fast or expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen\nAnd some people think that's more than ... needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nBehind the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen tells you to budget committee hearing last month\nThe soaring deficits are\nUnusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years when you look under this you find a number of elements a but one thing that jumped out this most recent reporters that corporate\nTax receipts have fallen by thirty percent\nIn the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates if these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out in ... is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not come up at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot is clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office in other\nUm uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more of the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAll right that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans though blame a government spending for the death said Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt was very disturbing ... programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid Dutch Seventy percent of what we spend\nYou're does he have a point [noise]\nWell I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid or fifty percent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans in interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent\nBut he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending as a society ages over the next decade are going to be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time David Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David\nYou're welcome this fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote in Georgia the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina and it's so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen for two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout\nHere's Alexandra open a member station WFSU\nTo prepare for early voting election director Adam Reagan in ... county just north of Charlotte is testing voting machines by running sample ballot through them [noise]\nThese machines were meant to be in five early voting locations throughout the county but the new law requires all types within a county to be open from ... to ... pm during the week and as a result Reagan can only open three sites this election\nEarly but he was very popular and gets to county and and I would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus are British eerie responsibilities to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights and a state where a voter id redistricting and early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring in June debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos quake said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting as them refer and has been referred by a certain population and certain populations who was right to vote as not only in our life has been rejected in recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen law that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the debate\nWhat we set out with the issue to do was to be able to make it more reliable and dependable John voters would know that the early voting sites or sites in the county was open from ...

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep actor Jonah Hill grew up in the age of irony for many young people in the nineties it was cool not to care about anything those who did were mocked one definition of nerd is just somebody who's really under something\nIn the world of a new movie directed by Jonah Hill caring can mean you're not manly Rachel Martin has the story of a film about which hill cares a lot Jonah Hill\nDidn't want his first directing project to be just anything you wanted a story that matter to him personally mid nineties isn't a story about his life per se but it is about the universal longing of a teenage kid who just wants to fit in [noise]\n\nI think you're pretty cool you\nFrom the slogan\nIt's about a group of friends growing up in LA yes in the nineties and skateboarding is at the center of their universe Jonah Hill was determined to treat it with that kind of reference\nSkateboarding has always shown his Cowabunga dude and like you know\nAnd it's offensive into skateboarding is really sensitive even when they heard oh it was a kid from Superbad is going to make a skateboarding movie you know like some down that was the reaction Oh yes skateboarding is the most protective insular community which is why it's so difficult to make a film involving its butchered you know it's misunderstood imagine if there was like ten movies about NPR hosts\nAnd none of them have been on the west right [laughter]\nThat's my next door but none of them had ever set foot in a recording booze interviewed anybody you know what I Do it's like any\nReally proud subculture so that's the backdrop at the center of the story is a Thirteen year old named Stevie things are bad for him at home his brother beats him up he is lonely and looking for some kind of connection Stevie sees this group of kids hanging out in front of escape shop and instantly he feels close to their tribe\nIt's the kind of closeness you can see from ten thousand miles away it's sort of a\nIdiosyncratic perverse closeness haired with a lot of toxic masculinity and\nOn the surface cruelty but such a deep connection and family situation did you have that did you have that group of skateboarding friends I did I've had it in many various ways whether it was skateboarding film\nBut I definitely felt like an outsider I definitely felt like I didn't belong and\nThere's a certain person that skateboarding draws huh you know skateboarding now is such a it's going to be the only sport for God's so mainstream but when I started the boarding it was not cool and society really look down on you as a nuisance\nOne of the things I loved about it was the non judgmental and this in certain ways escape orders and I think that created a lens that I saw life through whether it was sense of humor musical taste cinema taste it really wasn't ethic an aesthetic for me that I carry with me to this day\nThere was something about maybe it's just me but it was the Potter of how the guys talk to each other and maybe that's universal like this is how adolescent\nBoys are with each other they are too\nYeah and the only thing that's ever even come close it's been such a magical experience showing this film because it is my heart it is my heart and my soul\nAnd the point zero one percent where someone views the toxic masculinity or homophobia as me thinking that funny right has been heartbreaking because\nIt was done so intentionally to hold a mirror up to how people in this generation grew up in the changes we're having to make in the wrong lessons we've learned to me they speak so aggressively about women and gay people that it's it's that is how it was and I felt it would be way more disrespectful to change history\nThan to show it just as it was and let the audience to see how ugly feels\nOur pop culture critic cared NPR's Linda Holmes said this about the film quote it felt like a salute to how toxic masculinity makes boys feel included which is true she writes but not sweet as he'll seems to find it\nHow do you respond to that\nI just disagree I found that it was connective tissue which is unfortunate\nI still think these people were there for each other even though they had a lot of behavior I don't think is cool\nThe point of the movies that nothing's black or white I'm not I'm more or less I'm not here to like\nTell an audience how they should feel I think the way they speak about women and gay people is really a messed up way to go about that\nAnd then at the end of the film they still are there for one another so I don't think anyone is purely good are purely bad\nI Hope to create complex characters that constantly are challenging what you think of them\nCan I ask you about the casting because they're not a lot of names that people would perhaps recognize I mean the acting is pretty phenomenal especially the star the film and the guys who play the people in his boarding tribes [laughter]\nOh that's really nice I mean the singular most moving experience in my life was casting first time are not actors\nAnd they became these people and became actors in art is one of the kids all and the kids along curly hair who's very like white and fun and funny at lunch I was you know we all the kids were joke around talk trash and stuff and I thought he looked really offensive and that was abnormal\nAnd you feel kind of big brother leader protective over them so I was concerned and then I looked down and he had his rumpled up script under the table and he was rehearsing his lines during lunch and as a kid who had never thought about acting before\nWhich is so funny right because the guys the characters are playing are struggling to be perceived like they don't care about anything it's not cool to care\nIn the nineties especially it was the lame missing ever to say that you cared or tried at least in the culture I I grew up in right and what I Love about spending time with these kids now is that they are motivated\nAnd these kids give such naturalistic performances I and just so proud of them it's very moving\nYou got the directing back now you know my whole dream my whole life was to be a writer director I fell into this Fifteen your acting career where I got to learn from a lot of my heroes and\nIt's something I wanted to do and would have done sooner it's just that\nYou only get one chance to make your first film and I really wanted to wait till it was something that really meant something to me I Love this film I stand by it and I hope to just keep making things that I care about that would be a great life I should be so lucky\nThe film is called mid nineties Jonah Hill is\nThanks so much for talking yeah it was a pleasure thanks for having [noise]\n\nMerger cared enough to tune in

criticized for a slow response to hurricane Puerto Rico and then separated migrant families at the border and there was little doubt that Democrats will win the Latino vote but\nBy how much some Republicans hope to do better than expected which could be good enough Senator Ted Cruz has some Latino support as he runs for re election in Texas and then there's Rick Scott a Florida Republican governor is running for Senate in a state where the Latino vote is big and ...\nSo that's about all the reports along a busy street in Orlando a group of Rick Scott supporters chanted no more now than in Spanish as they wave Puerto Rican flags but just steps away the governor of Puerto Rico was backing Scott's opponent Bill Nelson\nI Am proud to say that I Am endorsing Bill Nelson for uh once I get in the U.S editor of Florida and helping people avoid them\nBut even in endorsing now and the governor of Puerto Rico described Rick Scott as a friend Scott has gone to Puerto Rico eight times in the last year he also created a welcome center at the Orlando Airport where Puerto Ricans arriving after Hurricane Maria could immediately get driver's licenses\nAnd through that all he's won over some skeptics\nMe the betting on us as you at risk up in the beginning that he was governor for electing\nCarrying the as far as considers herself a one hundred percent Democrats we first met him twenty Fifteen she despise Donald Trump back then and she still does but she says Rick Scott is no Donald Trump Scott has done a lot for Puerto Rico\nOr my input to go you know he'd do something for me\nAnd so she plans to vote for Scott this November\nWe're not MIT is a democratic pollster in Miami he says there are really two main strategies for any Republican to win Florida you either maximize the white vote or you chip away at the Hispanic vote\nPolling shows Nelson has the support of a majority of Latino voters but a couple of surveys in August and September showed scot doing well with Puerto Rican men and older Latinos\nAnd the fact that Scott was doing better than thirty five percent suggested that he was in a position to trying to deny Bill Nelson reelection which I think is a concern of many Democrats because potentially could up and any plans to recapture that chamber\nBut a Monday says even those Scott is trying to make inroads in the Latino community now since still has one big advantage\nHe happens to be on the ballot in the year we're at least the political atmospheric conditions suggests that it's good to be a Democrat\nDemocrats insist the choice is clear when you look at policy but voters don't always pay attention to policy sometimes they pay attention to who reaches out\nReached out to get it very early in the year and it's been passed and since then he's president and the Spanish media will radio and TV\nThat's likely to be a lot of progressive who works on Puerto Rican outrage and the Orlando area he is not a fan of Scott and thinks the governor was disastrous on health care and housing but he admits Scott is running a clever campaign\nWhat are you going to the job is building at the ... campaign to sharing and the little victories they may have had\nFor months Scott was bombarding the airwaves in Spanish and even those GOP previously raised millions of dollars for Donald Trump he now runs ads in Spanish and which he tries to distance himself from the president\nOne of the news doing their little located I mean the president to throw\nSome democratic and privately worry that Nelson ties with the Latino community\nAre not deep enough he's been in office for decades and during that time the Hispanic population has nearly tripled but now since campaign dismisses the criticism Amy McCotter state lawmakers supporting Nelson says Scott might be more visible but that's not\nA reason to vote for it I don't think that's the most important thing the fact that you see somebody all the time doesn't make them effective it's what they're doing that I think the most important so actions speak louder than words\nNelson says he's been busy with the Senate in Washington DC he points to his efforts to get hurricane relief fund for Puerto Rico he's held dozens of events this year focused on Latino voters and lately he's stepped up with his own Spanish language ads I smile at NPR News\nUSA Gymnastics is again looking for president

affirmative action a lawsuit is underway this week against Harvard University is led by a conservative activist who has no past charged that college efforts to balance their admissions discriminate against white students\nYet the Harvard suit alleges the university is unfair to Asian applicants and should be admitted even more than it does some Asian American groups support this move ... with a New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line can mourning\nMourning how widespread\nIs Asian Americans skepticism about anything that it's seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Asian American still are poor affirmative action but the the group that I talk to represent a growing very vocal faction and powered by social media out by their own and diligent an organizer they'd had quite an effectively and affecting the popcorn ...\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action\n[noise] well they are very much into a kind of number I should mention a a a coach should mission that isn't actually often exercise in reality but\nAre they view the quote unquote penalty toward Asian student I'm In categories like personal

different if we move away from an elite university like Harvard to a less elite university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around a hundred of action has went down to this question at Harvard because Harvard is an unusual institution and here's the thing um when we look at work play\nA job hiring contracting a lot of people Asian American equator supportive of that so it's really provide a you'd go at an issue at all\nOh okay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what a scene is affirmative action across the country\nI Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression that some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own\nReasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks at auction would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them weren't involvement by far or I'm waking up with it were worm so\nYou know they have a lot of autonomy

S. and from Americans for the arts\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I knew well king good morning we're going to turn now to recent developments in the economy because there have been a lot of them\nThe federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he called the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going to invest\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal morning David Corning so the president has colorfully criticize the fed before but calling it the the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new\nUm he's critique is that they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates to muck so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though on employment is that a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up\nBut I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go too fast or expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen\nAnd some people think that's more than ... needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nOur end the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen talking to budget committee hearing last month\nThese soaring deficits are\nUnusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years when you look under this you find a number of elements of but one thing that jumped out this most recent reporters that corporate\nTax receipts have fallen by thirty percent\nIn the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not gone up at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot is clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office and other uh uh\nThe arbiter say I think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more of the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that could happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun a bit Republicans though blame a government spending for the deaf said Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt's very disturbing it adrift drew in bed at three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid Dutch Seventy percent of what we found her ear\nDoes he have a point [noise] well I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid or fifty percent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent\nBut he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in\nAnd the big drivers of government spending as a society ages over the next decade are gonna be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time David Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David\nYou're welcome this fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote\nIn Georgia the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina and it's so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen for two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout\nHere's Alexandra Olga member station WFSU tea\nTo prepare for early voting elections director Adam Reagan in Gaston county just north of Charlotte is testing voting machines by running sample ballot through them [noise]\nThese machines were meant to be inside early voting locations throughout the county but the new law requires all fights with any county to be open from ... to seven PM during the week and as a result Reagan can only open three sites that selection\nEarly but he was very popular and guess county and and I would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus are this year have responsibilities to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights and a state where a voter id redistricting and early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring and joined debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one sided they'll down the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has been for fun and has been for a certain population and certain populations shoes right to vote as not only in our life but it's been rejected in a recent court decisions\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen law that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the Jim debate\nWhat we set out with the

affirmative action a lawsuit is underway this week against Harvard University it is led by a conservative activist who has no past to charge the college efforts to balance their admissions discriminate against white students\nYet the Harvard suit alleges the university is unfair to Asian applicants and should be admitted even more than it does some Asian American groups support this move ... with the New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line mourning\nMourning how widespread is Asian American skepticism about anything that is seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Asian Americans still Barclay port affirmative action but the the group that I talked to represent\nA growing and very vocal faction and powered by social media powered by their own and diligent an organizer they'd had quite an effectively and affecting the author I'm actually\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action\nWell they they're very much into a a kind of number I should mention a a a coach or admissions it isn't actually often exercise reality but uh they view the quote unquote penalty toward Asian student\nI'm In categories like the personal ranking a very subjective rank harbored offers\nMhm as a kind of an aging Asian American\nOr you say numbers based do you mean to say Asian Americans a lot of them do really well on tests and so they think the testing should be the be all and end all\nYeah and some of the folks I talked to create a ... a because a lot of them are a newer immigrants from mainland China or casting is very much a make or break way of social mobility\nOr they do believe that the court that Asian Americans get should count for more than I Am shocked features like leadership or um personal ranking\nIs this debate any different if we move away from it all the university like Harvard to a less elite university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around her neck action has what all down to this question at Harvard because Harvard is an unusual institution and here's the thing\nUm when we look at work play\nA job hiring contracting a lot of people Asian American leader or a quarter of a kind of that so that's really provide a youth wing go at an issue at all\nOkay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country I Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression\nThat some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own\nReasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThat talked it would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them were involved in the fight far before um linking up with that we're going on so\nYou know they have a lot of autonomy they're they're really doing what they want to all along could be able to partner with something someone like Rick blooms sort of serendipitous for both sides\nVery briefly what is Edward Blum the activists give them that they wouldn't otherwise have\nYou know I think he really has a long term vision he's been working a he was part of the goldfish
