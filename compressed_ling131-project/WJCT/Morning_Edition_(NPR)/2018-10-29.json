two surviving members horror of it than diamond have now published a collective memoir simply called beastie boys book they spoke to Rachel Martin about it\nIt's interesting to read about how the beastie boys came to know each other when they were teenagers and find their sound but honestly what drew me to this book was the idea of these guys now men in their fifties reflecting back on their life\nAnd I really had one main question had the beastie boys actually grown up and as you will hear in the following exchange\nThe answer is sort of here that I'm more of its reading an excerpt from the book about the lost art of mix tapes\nI'm not trying to be all well back in my day we had to carry blocks of ice up a mountain native shards of broken glass just to get a drink of a handful of rain\nBut it's true that the physical relationship to music was different there was more touching holding cursing and financing\n...\nBut never will read it and we might like where am I married I was a very\nSort of weight am I essential description of cars that much you're just going to have to trust me when I tell you that the two of them interrupted each other throughout our conversation with

around Manhattan all into clubs they shouldn't have been in making music wasn't supposed to be for them\n[laughter]\nRap was black music was underground music it wasn't something like teenage white guy's dead so why what made you think that people would take you seriously school people taking seriously wasn't something that was really a consideration for us [laughter] the second we heard\nRap music wasn't like anything else do we heard before it so that was like that's what we wanted to do and probably like so many other teenagers at the time whatever rap twelve and she would have come

because he had this vision for things but it was really\nAbout for all of us that we all felt the freedom that we're going to make what we want to make you know everything gets so big and so chaotic and so beyond our control but out of all that we realized wait\nIt's just the three of us we need to figure this out and not listen to anybody else and that somehow served us incredibly

you can read more remembrances of these men and women at NPR dark\n\nHere's a trend far more Democrats are describing themselves as progressive these days than they did four years ago there are

the status quo of our party and maybe even a status quo politics says that those are you know lines by which you have to stay away from if you want to win in a state like mine but I think our primary race really blew that to shreds\nGillum also wants to repeal the state's controversial stand your ground law the law gives Floridians the right to act in self defense even to the point of using deadly

Mexico's ambassador to the United states and bastard ...\nGood morning Steve I I Want to begin with the facts here seven thousand or so people which is a lot of people looks like a lot on TV but I Do know it's part of this much larger somewhat ordinary flow of migrants so how serious situation is is the view of your government\nWhat what we're facing here Steve is really a humanitarian crisis the Mexican government response has been\nBasically two things are urging people to winter in compliance with immigration law to Mexico and then F offering refugees that those two all those people from Central America to requested including\nHealth services education and an identification what the Mexican Government want to assure is that movement and whatever migration fixed place it's legal it's safe and ...\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the fall of Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have a meeting trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against a forward the even though that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee status of so Felice very simply to uphold our laws\nThere's for essence of the human rights commission on ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police cars acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced you\nOffered them refugee status I Believe you said and yeah the leader of his groups in from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan\nSeemed to do because of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but all of them would be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with a sign of well\nOut of the the number that we have is ... ... thousand five hundred people\nAre out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a ... percent that a request for refugees that this\nOne thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been ... to the states so right now it's unclear I think that a lot of them will in fact in requesting to stop this because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican ...\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's murder that's on all the numbers that have been a a thrown out there though Fisher number for us it's field around three thousand of them are in the states of ... the carbon was a little bit bigger but I'm Around two thousand I mention of ...\nYou know coastal five thousand have already a percent that their request for refugee status\nOr this is important in front of us perspective ambassador because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell as some of them are fairly inning tend to get to the U.S and we have close cooperation with us so far these two kinds of this\nIn the best possible way but I Do have to say that the official theories of the people that are still in the car to have such east around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps and around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and the ... the situation continues to evolve\nAnd uh obviously being monitored

did you tell people or I didn't speak the actual vigil itself but throughout the day as I was meeting with leadership and and speaking to groups I think the the most powerful conversation I had was with the students at University of Pittsburgh\nOr who are really struggling with a how to make sense of what had happened um and I think the message to them was to double down on our commitment to love and to a as Dr King said not try and drive out hate with hate only love can do that\nAnd you know David want you to remember that this massacre was perpetrated by a person who's not only anti Semitic and hated Jews but he targeted this synagogue because they had had refugee ship but they were working with highest which is a historic Jewish Agency that\nAre resettled refugees from all over the world not just Jewish refugees Muslim refugees Christian refugees\nAnd it was a commitment that the synagogue had made to welcome asylum seekers and migrants and so I think the message is we as Jews look outward and welcome all people with love and open arms and we're going to continue to fight for the widow and a stranger and the orphan and all those who are suffering in our midst I just think\nAbout this I mean it's been more than a year now since Charlottesville and the unite the Right rally in and there were people infamously chanting Jews will not replace us I'm now we have this uh what what are you learning in these moments about anti Semitism in the United states of America\nAnd let's not forget David that in Charlottesville\nAre not many people don't remember that that same morning three of those white nationalist neo Nazi thugs stood outside the local synagogue in Charlottesville with assault rifles threatening so what we saw as threatening of gun violence a year ago has now become a massacre with gun violence\nSo the two conclusions I draw our that words matter and rhetoric and kind of this climate of bigoted rhetoric matters and when the right and the kind of a a ... to the right wing extremists on all sides get emboldened when white supremacists get involved and then they turn to action\nAnd the plague of gun violence in our country this is what the students were outraged about these are the same students who after the Parkland shooting a mobilized on the march for our lives and have been working on this upcoming election\nAnd they in tears said to me rabbi has nothing changed since Parkland and I had to reassure them that the arc of history as long as Dr King taught ... towards justice\nAre you optimistic that we can grow from this I Believe
