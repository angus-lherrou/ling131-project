C.\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California President Trump's political career is in park defined by his willingness to openly mocked people he disagrees with now Trump is calling for civility after at least seven apparent pipe bombs were mailed to his political opponents\nYeah that's right at a rally in Wisconsin last night Trump condemned the act and then he turned his attention to the press\nThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil town as you stop the endless hostility and constant negative\nAnd oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nSo far authorities haven't released any information about a possible suspect\nAll right we're joined by White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR's national security correspondent Ryan Lucas to talk through all of this morning to you both mourning mourning Iran I Want to start with you it seems like there were at least seven of these devices mailed out um who are these suspicious packages meant for\nWell the first was found Monday outside of New York home of the billionaire investor George Soros who of course there's also a big contributor to democratic causes a the others were then discovered address to Hillary Clinton a former president Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan\nNow the package that was intended for Britain was actually sent it to CNN office in New York\nAnd discovered in the mail room there yesterday and then late last night the FBI said that it had confirmed\nTo more suspicious packages that were very similar in appearance of the other five\nAre these two were address to Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very sharp critic of a President Trump so officials are\nAlready talking about these things as pipe bomb they're using that term what what exactly are those and and who would have wanted to send pipe bombs to to these people\nWell in terms of who would have wanted to send them we don't we don't know at this point uh there is no word on a possible suspect\nUh this is still very early in the investigation now as for the the the packages themselves um we know that they were sent in identical bubble raft manila envelopes uh they were the address is on them were all computer printed\nOn the return address on every single package was that a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida are each package had six us a postal service stamps the one that was actually address to a former attorney general holder\nDidn't make it to his office it was a return to sender the FBI says so in that case to the address of Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages she has said that she's a very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this and it actually her own office in Florida was evacuated yesterday or because of a suspicious package there\nTam let's turn this over to you for a minute I mean this is a pretty unusual moment in the country's recent history how was the president been reacting the president has\nBeen reacting in the way that you would expect the president to react he has at can damage or any acts or threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nI'm ... and in his rally speech last night and he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he he's talking about wanting to turn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe at not at attacking once political enemies in moral terms\nNow the reality is that he has done just that attacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nYeah well it's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative [noise] um but it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday yeah so this rally was\nAt an airport had aircraft hangar in ah in Wisconsin um and there was a big crowd of people and it had all the trappings of a usual Trump rally\nAccept that then the president simply red from the teleprompter and uh he he does this it ... it was almost like he went to a rally and he delivered a speech that you'd see in the East Room at the White House um and he was um he was a self conscious about that I sort of\nCalling it out to his supporters they're saying hey look I mean here's a clip\nYou see how nice ... there's like have you ever seen that [noise]\nWe're all very well [noise] and we can keep it that way right\nHow long he keeps it that way is not clear a off and he will become teleprompter Trump for a while and then he will switch back to rally Trump uh and and you just don't know when it's going to happen in the prison\nIsn't saying anything directly about the people who were targeted to have any of them said anything\nYeah that's right he didn't say any of the names of the people who've been targeted often they're features of his rally at a Hillary Clinton was speaking yesterday at\nAn event and she said that she is fine thanks to the secret service she called it a troubling time a deep divisions in the country NPR's Tamara Keith and Ryan Lucas thanks

allegations are about Exxon refusing to write down the value of its fossil fuel assets that are still in the ground\nTwo sets of books one internally that they were um keeping so that they understood

[noise]\nI'm Joshua Johnson New York times reporter Suzanne Craig and Ross Buechner on which taxes President Trump avoided and which ones he might have invaded next time on one day\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm David Greene so when the final season of the hit Netflix series house of cards Francis Underwood is dead and the spotlight now turns to Claire Underwood the first woman president of the United states you play by Robin Wright [noise]\nFirst one hundred days president\nFriend is dead or may not by me here's the thing\nWhatever friends told you the last five years [noise]\nDon't believe a word [noise]\nNow the death of her husband was a rewrite the show runners Frank pull you as a and Melissa James Gibson how to re envision their Emmy Award winning show after Kevin Spacey who played for instance Underwood was accused of sexual harassment and assault last year they were determined to continue house of cards without him\nRobin Wright Frank and Melissa James Gibson all sat down together in our studios in New York City to talk with Rachel Martin\nRobin if I could ask you about the allegations who told you\nOr did you find out in the press\nAnd we all found out through the press and you know of course shocking surprise and then you're polarized as a team\nWith the moral and ethical thing to do and they made an executive decision and Marcy a Netflix and and all of us deciding to close out this beautifully operatic show and what it also would have meant to shut down\nIs that we would have been putting almost two thousand people out of a job in the state of Maryland where we shoot and that was security that people were dependent on\nDid you essentially have to go back to square one I mean how much had you already started to think about the upcoming season or even I think I read you'd started shooting at right Melissa put you on the spot we had started shooting it and we we'd throw at it through um really quite just about the whole thing\nBut all of the DNA was was there at you know she's in five ended with a rabbit character Claire turning to the camera and saying my turn so that was indeed what we continue to serve and explore and I will say just because\nThe character Francis Underwood is not on the screen doesn't mean who's essence is not on the screen and that doesn't mean that is not still being dealt with and in his options became a traumatic opportunity to see who would try to fill that space\nRight we knew to deny the existence of Francis Underwood would be dishonest you know to the history of the show um there's no way that ... and in dialogue with her past him she's forging a future for herself and she may be comfortable\nIn this position but others around her or not and there's this scene early on when ... character this D.C power broker he has could Joel old Clare president Underwood into signing the bill and when she finally agrees he\nPhysically grabs her hand and covers it with his as she signs it and I found this so disturbing to watch\nMaybe because of everything else that around the show but like this idea that he feels he could manipulate her what was that seemed like\nFree riding there's a lot of discussion around that remember where I was in which she asked for\nComment and the decision\nAnd behind saying yes to let him do that was because in politics and what's so much of the backbone of the show is about is you always have to sacrifice something to get what you want\nI mean we always knew that we wanted this season to be an exploration of who owns the White House so no matter what and this was a physical managed than infestation of a of a scene we were working on\nAnd you know ... ... is this country [laughter] you know within the world of the show ready for a female president\nHer [noise] um if I could ask you Robin just about your relationship with Kevin Spacey you've talked about read it before as something that was a it was a professional relationship um you didn't really know him socially\nBut you told variety last month and I'm quoting here that you feel sorry for anybody who's life is in the public arena that you hate that part of the industry\nAnd you also said you believe in second chances do you still feel that way about Hollywood writ large and about about Kevin Spacey\nUm yes I hate what the media does with our sentiments in our words um [noise]\nAnd I didn't say just that sentence is the problem being extracted [noise]\nUm you know that's one sentence out of a paragraph that I said I said I Believe when people do the work and they reform I think everybody has the ability to do that\nDo the work and reform that is what I said and in that instance then you should be given a second chance in life\nIf they're true change that occurred so I wasn't pinpointing\nAny specific human being I was talking about humankind and their abilities so when I was paraphrased um I've just decided to not common anymore because I'm I'm so sick of\nBeing taken out of context and then then that's being insensitive to victims out there that I'm not insensitive to\nAs you all move away from this project\nWhat have you learned from this show these characters\nNormally you're making a movie for six eight ten weeks and then you say goodbye or those people\nThis was a six year relationship that we had we spent more time with each other than we did our own families and people would come on set and they walk off and they were like wow it's palpable how close everyone is you can feel how everyone had each other's back they just want all\nOf you to do the best work I mean we would crack up after a certain\nScenes lines that you guys could right and we're like we just actually ... [laughter] we line came out of my\nMouth I Can't believe that it was fun the last day of shooting I imagine was full of a lot of emotions it was just jumping up and down in shopping at the same time you get to put characters to bed I'm sure it's the same for you guys as writers right\nYeah but that night nobody wanted to go to bed don't nobody will do not want to leave this said it was until they break that people actually finally left because well didn't want to go [noise]\nWell it has been a pleasure talking with the three of you thank you thank you [noise]\nThat was our co host Rachel Martin speaking with Robin Wright who stars in the Netflix show how hard she was also joined by the show runners Frank for you as a family physician [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Noel King [noise]\n[noise]\nUnlock your news member but over one of those episodes of your favorite TV show\nPassport or a glass of this American Life and coming to Jacksonville talk I costs seven things I've learned worked out a bunch of stories and videos that have never been on the radio Saturday you remember ten\nAboard a theater tickets at Florida Theater duck\nOn the next radiolab story of a serial killer he's writes his lawyer and a dangerous secret that set a precedent that's on the next radiolab Sunday at noon on eighty nine nine W.

[noise]\nEight out of ten white evangelicals voted for President Trump and twenty sixteen and poll suggests they continue to strongly support him\nBut ahead of the mid term elections new group is trying to carve out a space for evangelicals who find themselves at odds with the president's rhetoric and policies as NPR's Sarah McCammon reports they're asking conservative Christians to think differently about issues like abortion it sounds a little bit like a church service\n[noise]\nAnd a bit like a campaign rally you've heard it\nRepublican we're here to remind\nOn a recent evening under the heavy branches of live oak trees Doug Padgett stood before a couple of dozen people gathered on folding chairs on the Rice University campus in Houston\nBack home in Minneapolis patch it is a pastor and he describes himself as a progressive evangelical but right now he's traveling the country by bus preaching a message that juxtapose is Trump campaign slogans against quotes from the Bible\n... years to be reminded the first\nThe kingdom of God on behalf of all of them were [noise]\nWe must not record we're here to be reminded that you can go home for a very so\n... it's called

donations their touring the country ahead of the midterms visiting more than thirty congressional districts chosen in part based on their religious makeup\nCongressman Ted Lieu of the Democratic congressional campaign committee has informally advised the group\nAnd an event in San Antonio this week Tracy good rich who is still home schooling two of her for kids that she and her husband quietly left their evangelical church soon\nAfter the election that kind of feel like I'm In the base where I grew up in the evangelical home\nAnd with the\nSeveral years has kind of not have feeling like I have a home as the things that I was about representing pricing Christ likeness had been completely the opposite things I have and supported by family and friends and community\nThe average says she voted for Republicans until twenty sixteen but she doesn't like the way Trump talks about vulnerable people she says like immigrants women and the poor she says many ever evangelical friends initially opposed Trump until it became clear he would be the Republican nominee\nLiterally all of a sudden Donald Trump you know we couldn't see anything wrong with Donald Trump it was just like [noise]\nNow were blind to everything Donald Trump but it was all on the abortion issue\nWhich describes herself as pro life but says a lot of other issues like helping the poor should be just as important to Christians that's in line with the message the common good is preaching as the group tours of the country\nSinger me up have been traveling with the group performing him\n\nHe's ruining predominantly black Baptist church unlike their white evangelical counterparts black Christians overwhelmingly vote for Democrats have said people who've faced a history of disenfranchisement often see the abortion debate\nWhen you are fighting to keep your family together when you're fighting to keep your children face from criminals and some cops\nWhen you don't know if someone's going to pick up your resume because of your name\nIs something that we feel we can leave in God's hands\nGot padded says since the bus began visiting parks in churches in early October the issue has come up again and again\nI've not thought or talked about abortion in Fifteen Years as much as I have in the last three weeks\nPatch it published an op ed in USA Today this week arguing that evangelicals should put more energy into reducing abortions and trying to criminalize them and should vote against politicians who support Trump's agenda\nChristian Hawkins who runs the anti abortion rights groups students for life is a former evangelical who converted to Catholicism she says she's heard this argument before and doesn't think most conservative Christian voters will buy it because of how they view abortion\nThere are certainly a lot of issues that Christian care about when they go to vote by the end of the day we know that there is a human rights atrocity happening inside of our country not atrocity is abortion\nHowever the issues are framed poster Robin Jones of the public religion research Institute says moving white evangelicals away from the G O P would be an uphill battle\nYeah once you have several generations that are voting eighty percent Republican I'm it's less that they're doing that because of one particular issue and more than it has become in many ways a kind of tribal identity that's just inextricably tied to even talk all identity I think that that is the tie that binds much more than any single issue\nThe common good is trying to push beyond those identities

Supreme Court but to the lower court says well\nLower court nominations don't get a lot of public attention they usually fly below the radar but they've long been governed by an elaborate series of Senate rules and traditions\nThat are aimed at ensuring that presidents don't have carte blanche to pick nominees now those traditions are being tossed aside at a rapid rate NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story\nPrior to the Trump Administration there was plenty of tit for tat and the escalating partisan war is over judicial nominations\nBut the tactics were aimed at blocking nominees since President Trump was sworn in however the GOP Senate leadership has moved aggressively to speed confirmation of new judges in the process ignoring our tossing aside rules that have long existed to ensure that there is some consensus in picking judges\nGone for all practical purposes is the rules that prevented action on a judicial nominee who was not approved by his or her home state senator\nGone is the practice of not holding a confirmation hearing until the American bar association has completed its professional evaluation of the nominee\nGone is the general practice of not piling up nominees in one hearing and now for the first time the Judiciary Committee is holding confirmation hearings during a Senate recess over the objections of the minority party\nNo other Senate committee has been holding hearings during their recess but for judicial nominees the Senate confirmation train keeps on running even though and likely because Senate Democrats are defending a near record number of seats in the election and have to be out on the house things\nIndeed just two Republican senators Orrin Hatch of Utah who is retiring and my ... of Idaho showed up at yesterday's hearing for two appeals court nominees\nA hearing that lasted just Nineteen Minutes and featured one controversial nominees talking for several minutes about his wife parents children even his cat\nI asked Senator Hatch who never agreed to such a recent hearing when he chaired the Judiciary Committee why Republicans went ahead this time\nWell I don't know why all I can say is that the you know we have to move move ahead than if they're not cooperating you just go ahead and move ahead and so far we haven't had a lot of cooperation\nGoing ahead has yielded important

opponents of President Trump now we should say the president's political careers in part defined by his willingness to openly mocked people he disagrees with but Trump right now is calling for

night the FBI said that it had confirmed to more suspicious packages that were very similar and the parents or the other five\nAre these two were addressed to Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very short critic of a President Trump\nSo officials are already talking about these things as pipe bomb they're using that term what what exactly are those and and who would have wanted to send pipe bombs to to these people\nWell in terms of who would have wanted to send them we don't we don't know at this point there is no word on a possible suspect\nUh this is still very early in the investigation now as for the the the packages themselves um we know that they were sent in identical bubble raft manila envelopes uh they were the address is on them were all computer printed\nOn the return address on every single package was that of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida are each package had six us a postal service stamps\nThe one that was actually address to a former attorney general holder didn't make it to his office it was a return to sender the FBI says so in that case\nTo the address of Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages she has said that she's a very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this and it actually her own office in Florida was evacuated yesterday or because of a suspicious package there\nTam let's turn this over to you for a minute I mean this is a pretty unusual moment in the country's recent history how was the president reacting\nThe president has been reacting in the way that you would expect the president to react he has at can damage or any acts or threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nI'm ... and in his rally speech last night\nAnd he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he he's talking about wanting to turn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe not at attacking one political enemies in moral terms now the reality is that he\nHas done just that attacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nIt's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative [noise] um but it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday\nYeah so this rally was at an airport had aircraft hangar in ... in Wisconsin um and there was a big crowd of people and it had all the trappings of a usual Trump rally\nAccept that then the president simply red from the teleprompter and uh he he does is it ... it was almost like he went to a rally and he delivered a speech that you'd see in the East Room at the White House um and he was um he was a self conscious about that I sort of\nCalling it out to his supporters they're saying hey look I mean here's a clip by the way\nYou see how nice to have you ever seen that [noise]\nWe're all very well [noise]\nAnd we
