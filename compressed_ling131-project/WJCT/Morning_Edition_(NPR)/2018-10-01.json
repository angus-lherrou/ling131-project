I guess we should remember that the old NAFTA it's a free trade agreement but not strictly that its free trade except when it's not quite free trade there are a lot of complexities but the basic idea is goods crossing borders without tariffs most of the time how is this new agreements supposed to be different\nWell let's start with a brand new parts of the sections that can't on the U.S agreed upon in this last minute scramble both sides gave up some ground from positions that they were pretty entrenched on Canada said it's going to pry open it's dairy\nIt which has been very protected open it up more to us farmers\nThe U.S backed away from this demand they wanted to get rid of these independent dispute resolution panels that deal with complaints about unfair trade the administration didn't like them at all thought they stepped all over American sovereignty\nUs gave gave up there um and also significantly in the U.S agreed a rich and understand with candidates not going to go ahead and slap tariffs on autos imported from Canada prison trumpet threatened that a bunch of times\nUm remember those those terrorists on a Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum sure you know they're still in place for now and they're supposed to be negotiated\nOut on the ... oh that's interesting you mentioned that dairy rules will change this has been like a very public complained to the president he's made a number of complaints about Canadian dairy practices so you're saying that will change but I Do have to ask this is an immense trading relationship between three nations is it really changing that much\n[noise] well that's an interesting question I mean you know ... parts of it that were in place already when the U.S and Mexico came to an agreement are\nYou know are significant and the ones that really aren't deal with auto manufacturing you know it ...\nThe ... that increases the amount of content that has to be produced within the border of North America and and more significantly even it requires that at least forty percent of the vehicles made in within this trade zone\nHas to be made by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour you know this was designed to push up wages in America and hopefully to the Trump Administration move more manufacturing a back to the u._s. it's\nGot a new name though doesn't it which is not insignificant because this is a president who is all about branding so if you've got a new name then something's changed right\nWell you know that President Trump always hated NAFTA you're always call it a total disaster the worst trade agreement that the U.S has ever negotiated so yeah it's\nStates Mexico Canada agreement\nExact right ... right cause them to smoke you use ... does it it was ... we had to go out of five or so um what has to happen in order for this to be final this Congress have to sign off yeah Congress has to approve\nIt you know um that would have been very very hard if we just the U.S Mexico deal alone probably the odds are better if it's if it's all three countries um but we'll wait and see what happens in the midterms if the Democrats take control the house or Senate or both they could insist on changes and make it difficult\nWell that's interesting although of course there are some Democrats who would favor changes NAFTA also already thanks very much You're welcome ...\n... maybe

to Benjamin Netanyahu's agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably two state is more likely but you know what if they do seem to if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they both happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less\nSome Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts ... told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care to state that represents them is that Israel or Palestine or some other science fiction name\nHe's are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity therapy in which they fulfill themselves as individuals and groups in every possible way that any American a rich person or Chinese person wouldn't well\nPalestinians today I've traveled going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces\nBut demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that if the Palestinians are denied estate millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter differently he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement\nOf a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister [noise]\nLook I think people mean different things when there's two states going into the liberal I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement with the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to not have the power for\n... power that must not be in their hand is the question of security in the area was to the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's\nAll about the width of about ... kilometers mhm we're both Palestinians and Israelis Lou Israel must return overarching security responsibility otherwise we'll good what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left and basically militant\nIslam came in under\n... observing drew on or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gov observing them or do we do if you have a state that have most of ...\nBut not the our security is the other food or not if I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position I've been very very clear\nBoth to the previous administration under the Trump\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago and a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that there are two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or\nIsrael is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says now you're not willing to put the state labeled again\nPenn State label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject for Israel but I think there is it's not an either or model I think we have a third modeling preferred leave which is basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones who obscurity look in the middle east which was littered with failed states\nThat's often the best you can do to try to do something of you know you get a ...\nBut your your town and work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads side of the question are you willing to support a proposal that would give\nPalestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights than their own territory in other words they have their own parliament now their own government going flag on their own or\nWhatever I don't even know but they have very very little writes compared to what the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer a role model oh Jim or no blue governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd or with the Palestinians are actual demanding something that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time but they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have a lot and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have an overriding bar and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question\nHow come you don't feel that much terrorism in the west back well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good I'm going out with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off\nBut here's how it's done we have the intelligence about terrorists in one of the Palestinian town\nAnd we would call up typically I don't know if ... wanted to take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't know why should we

teacher inspired her in a way he may\nNot have intend to teach me how to blow up a little girl so play rock and roll you think that compels you even further out\nAs a teenager Jones formed her first band and all girl hard rock group called the runways today they seem way ahead of their time but in the late seventies many people didn't know what to think and the thoughts that did occur to them were pretty vile there were people\nRight from the total very beginning that we're\nTaking shots and being very nasty what did they say exactly [noise]\nSlut die core [noise]\nTrying to throw us off our game trying to get us not to have that sort of confidence in our own selves and now that was easy to do because his teenage girls\nI was not\nConfident you know and I sort of set off the other

of second class citizens and um so the girls were responding to what they perceived\nAs or power I suppose thousands of girls rock in our car and stuff it was quite a juxtaposition from what we experience shaped\n[noise]\n\nRoughly a year later you decided that the band had\nJust gone in a different direction and you had to leave what was that decision like\nSo horrible it felt like defeat\nAnd um was all for stupid reasons why I thought and you know so it was really it was gut wrenching for me because of the runways ... was my baby\nYou went to a pretty dark place\nYeah yeah yeah what do you remember from that time\n[laughter]\nYeah not a lot I was trying to\nBury at all you know it was too painful to to sort of a try to assess and figure out what happened I mean I was I was in trouble and I thought about joining the military exits I'll learn something on meet people get some discipline all travel\nAnd um I never had to do that because a couple of weeks later I I met Kenny Laguna who uh met me to complete a project at the runways had signed on to before we broke up to write some songs for for a movie\nAnd counties here so you can ... just a second but I Want to go get a little more so you meet this guy this music producer Kenny Laguna right\nKenny had made a name for himself doing music\nThat is different than yours is a it was something called ... music at the

it's possible but you're not deciding yet that he did lie\nI think it's entirely possible I'm frankly speaking for myself I thought the tone of the judge Kavanaugh use the very explicit part isn't um attacks I'm On the Senate and in particular in the Senate Democrats\nAre really did not show a judicial temperament he would have been better suited to leave those a sharp and partisan attacks against Senate Democrats to his advocates on the committee\nAlthough we should be Frank senator Republicans of course have accused Democrats of extreme partisanship here they don't like the way that these allegations were revealed that they don't like the demands for further investigation and\nYour colleague Lindsey Graham the Republican colleague Lindsey Graham in his speech or explosion really when he was quite angry or during the testimony on Thursday said of Democrats quote what you want to do is destroyed this guys\nWife hold his seat open and hope you win in twenty twenty I'd like to ask directly used that gr objective to keep the Supreme Court seat open for years if necessary until Democrats can install someone you like\nThat's not my goal um and I found a senator Graham's outburst really are both out of character and\nUh unfortunately contributed to what has been a sharply partisan divide on the committee I I think part of what made a Senator Flake or join me in my call for a week long pause\nWas his concern um that are this hearing and this environment is not just tearing apart our committee and the Senate but reflects a way in which were tearing the country apart\nLooked real hair and all this I think as Dr Ford who came forward with allegations when she had nothing to gain and everything to lose I think this one week pause is a\nReasonable bipartisan gesture not to keep this nomination open indefinitely but to show that we took seriously enough doctor for delegate lead to actually\nTo let me just ask about thirty seconds or so senator if you're presented with a candidate for this position\nWho you extremely disagree with on the issues but Kavanaugh is cleared or someone comes after him who has a clean record or a seemed to have a clean record are you going to say yes even though we just lost the process is fair it's fine Republicans won they got their justice are you going to accept that process\nUm I did call the White House and urge the president to nominate someone who is can for mobile\nWhen Justice Kennedy announced his resignation I Will say the judge Kavanaugh is truly at the extreme end of an American legal thought on some key issues I intend to vote against him but I Do think that this week pause was an important opportunity for the allegations against him to be investigated\nAnd either um confirmed or denied\nSenator Chris Coons of Delaware thanks so much thank you Steve\nI have a good morning now and NPR's Mara Liasson has been listening along with us here Mara Liasson what did you hear there\nWell what I heard was that a senator Coons laid down the criteria for what would satisfy him and my thought was that doesn't really matter if it satisfies any Democrats\nThe only thing that matters is is the process this week long investigation satisfies Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake who are the three moderate Republicans who wanted this pause something the president and\nA leader Mitch McConnell and Kavanaugh himself didn't want but the math is that the Republicans can afford to only lose one vote and you have senator Collins saying it's very quote reassuring to the public that we're doing this investigation he's\nUm she said it shows Republicans want to make sure we have all the facts to make an informed decision so there might be the kind of thing Democrats wanted to but be aware of what you wish for because it just might Greece this gives for a cabinet confirmation\nNPR's Mara Liasson thanks very much\nThank you it's October and the fall election campaign is in high gear so or the social media operations full of mind games and false heads things that marred the twenty sixteen election campaign NPR's Tim Mak has been asking how people can protect themselves\nThe online social media world in many ways is an illusion the Senate intelligence committee recently heard from an expert who testified there is twenty five to thirty times more fake information from automated accounts on the extreme left in the extreme right then there is genuine real life conversation\nAnd with the mid term elections just around the corner experts are bracing for a spike in foreign disinformation we're going to have an October surprise that spread brewing\nWho during the Obama administration worked at the national Security Council on how to respond to Russia's efforts to spread false information during the invasion of Ukraine is\nNot a question in my mind of whether it's going to happen it is a crushing only of when and how large\nThe government and America's intelligence agencies have traditionally been more capable in tracking cyber attacks and espionage\nBut the Russian online influence operations during the twenty sixteen elections were done All right there in the open something that caught American spies and law enforcement off guard here's Victoria Nuland a top State Department official during the Russian interference campaign and twenty sixteen testifying before Congress\nThere was a tendency in the U.S intelligence community to look only at classified information so we were as a government not as aware of what was happening in the private sector\nNow Americans won't be caught off guard like they were then but we still need to Wade through the sludge of our online news environments and be smarter about the information we read and I just here's April ... who's the head of intelligence law at the national Security Agency that's been\nSocial science research demonstrating that if I tell you some really outrageous proposition something that's clearly an chair I tell you you know it came this guy's green today the first time I say to us it's a dumb thing I've ever asked\nThe next time I say you're going to be more inclined to believe that and by the third or fourth or fifth time it starts sounding almost possible\nA big problem is the nature of the Internet which allows for an actress to pretend to be American spreading real information here's Kevin Mandiant the c._e._o. of cyber security firm FireEye\nIs an unbelievably complex challenge for a free society especially with the anonymity of the Internet to really police you know the ideas that you're reading the ideology or reading and who the true source of those ideas are\nRafi Krikorian joined the Democratic National Committee in twenty Seventeen to be the lead on cybersecurity and has given some serious thought about how to combat misinformation\nWhen I Would tell my father to do is going to stick to just look for opposing points of view should understand what the opposition to a point of view might be in like a huge data in putting your own head to try to sort through what's going on\nUltimately the biggest recommendation from experts in online disinformation campaigns is to diversify your new sources and remain skeptical\nThe German that we use is digital resilient that's ... who leads the Atlantic council's digital forensics research lab of a degree of critical thinking where if you see something that's overly a motive or you know doesn't seem quite right\nCheck another source just do some basic kind of legwork on your own to say okay well that could be right it could be wrong and just have a degree of skepticism on what you're seeing online\nAnd if there's one thing about which there's bipartisan consensus in Washington DC it's
