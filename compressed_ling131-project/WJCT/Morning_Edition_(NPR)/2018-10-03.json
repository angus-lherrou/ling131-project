J. C. T. eighty nine nine is that\nYour community your world [noise]\nGood morning we know more today about President Trump's finances how we acquired much of his money from his father an hour's wealth is change\nThe New York times reports the trumps father slipped him a few hundred million dollars of waiting taxes and according to Forbes magazine the president has tried and failed to profit on his\nI'm Steven and I'm Rachel Martin the death\nToll continues to rise after the deadly earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia\nNow asking is that country's early morning to fail\nAnd the decades old back story of American conflict with North Korea it is Wednesday October\nAnd the claim that he only ever got a million dollars from his dad and it was alone and that was it was always bogus it sounds like he himself I don't think different\nYeah I don't think anybody took that very seriously for very long\nDamn Alexandra Forbes thanks very much\nThank you [noise]\nNow when the president talks he's sometimes slurs his words and his words about public policy are often disjointed\nBut in a speech last night President Trump sounded a theme he seemed more comfortable with defending people he believes are falsely accused accused of sexual misconduct he took the opportunity to mock a woman who says she was sexually assaulted the president was speaking Christine Blasey Ford who says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh attacked or during a party when they're both in high school\nBut Ford has not recalled every detail Trump described her testimony this way\nI had one I had one\nWell do you think it was it was what I'll do it\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise] the president\nHimself had described forward as credible just days ago without birth to a cheering crowd and Mississippi comes as the Senate prepares to vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd the fight over that vote has in some ways been changing\nThe United States Senate to development with long term implications NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell has been watching it happened and she's in our studios in mourning mourning what's different about the Senate\nThings are testy things are we're watching the senators fight with each other basically on the Senate floor which is not something they typically do they keep their fight to the hallways or do you know to sniping in private but this has become\nAn intensely political fight and it's not just about whether or not ... you know blessing for his memory was exactly what she said it would be it was also in some ways about the treatment and the conversation around sexual assault\nAnd the idea that it could be becoming more political conversation it's something that Senator Bob Corker mentioned to me when I caught up with him yesterday with listen\nI Know a lot about sexual\nAssault that we don't care about that is ridiculous but that's the way it's being portrayed and and uh you know it's a shame\nNow Corker is retiring and he's had his very public clashes with the president in the past but it does bring up this idea that comment like company making make it harder for Republicans to keep this out of the political around and keep this focus on moving Kavanaugh forward as a conservative judge that they support for his judicial record\nI guess the application of someone like Corker is they they really rather sexual assault not be something that we have to political debate something we could all agree is is a bad thing and I should be prosecuted or should be dealt with and some very direct way instead it's become this matter of intense political debate you said people are tense\nI ... I Want to underline that for people who don't follow the Senate every day I'm sure these guys have never really liked each other just as early but something's different now\nYeah I mean they they get into arguments but the Senate has kind of it and it's titled as the world's greatest deliberative body and part of that is that they like to get into debates they talk to each other they work out in the gym together but I'm hearing stories about staff meeting that are becoming public griping sessions where people are complaining about each other\nAnd it's also getting a little bit tense for senators who are worried about their safety\nNow I I Walk around the Capitol almost every day and it's very rare to see somebody who isn't a top leader with a police escort but members Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee are walking around public spaces with police officers that their side and people are being confronted in airport that become quite it's it's a big change\nThe fact of the matter though is that the president sees this as a political winner for this method she was asked by a reporter Peter Alexander of NBC yesterday do you have a message for young men in this moment the president responded it's a very scary time for young men in America that is not something I imagine that senators ahead of mid term want to double down on no because\nRepublicans in particular are fighting for the vote of women and we talked about that in ... very often but that is coming up yet again\nKelsey thanks for your reporting really appreciate thank you That's NPR's Kelsey Snell\nOr at the embattled prime minister of the United kingdom Theresa May is giving a speech this morning at the annual meeting of her conservative party\nThis week her rivals have attacked her plan for breakfast with what many also see as an idle replacing her as prime minister meanwhile they're just two weeks left before may is supposed to meet with the European Union and come up with yet another new plan that they might accept\nNPR's Frank Langfitt has been at the party's meeting in Burma do they say Birmingham in Birmingham yeah remembering 'em Birmingham Birmingham, England this week and he's now back in London or what do we expect from this speech ...\nWell I think the context is part of the most important thing in the sense that breakfast is the biggest challenge we talked about this before that the u._k. space probably since the end of World War two there's tremendous uncertainty here a question about the leadership in the direction of the country\nAnd people are expecting her to strike an optimistic note but they're going to be I think more focused on her presence or confidence or delivery\nCan she convinced people it's it's very difficult time that she can pull off a Brexit deal when he was against it which he's pitched as well as many members of her own party um and last month and a huge rejected her breakfast planned people's you saw that as a public humiliation\nStates to come out and appear strong especially as you were pointing out their rivals who are clearly eyeing the waters here and maybe looking for an opening in of course\nIf you remember from last year it's got to be a lot better than last year speech because she got into a terrible coughing fit and that was deemed disaster there should be better\nOkay so hopefully she's got some water up they're going to be a Boris Johnson just name one rival uh not not too happy with her at the moment\nNo not at all he actually came out yesterday what was called the fringe event away from the main venue\nAnd he told the party to just get your plan a witch her plan calls for a closer relationship with you a he called it a cheat an outrage these are very strong words at a at a party meeting and not what people voted for it back in two thousand and sixteen um she wants a short break and more independent of Britain and here's some of what he had to say\nIf we did it wrong army perceive that he's gone democratic solution if you laid off in Hong Kong we won't put traps these talks tedious business\nPortraying ... for ... years it was go out to bars that classic bars are although you know um I mean it's just it has been pretty toxic and pretty tedious it's the same story over and over again how is driven by responding to this\nWell she kind of put him down she said uh you know ... always puts on a good show but\nShe said his plan doesn't do anything to avoid a hard border a new border on the island of Ireland which is a big issue and people are very concerned about\nUh Johnson is known to be very ambitious but many in the conference actually that I talked to a day at the meeting up in Birmingham don't think he's necessarily the right person for the job at this time he's charismatic he's entertaining sometimes they'll soon as we don't really detailed guy and trade negotiations are pulled out details\nDelicate I Want to make sure that I understand the bottom line here Frank Langfitt spoke it sounds like Britain conservatives continue to argue among themselves among variations on a plan you know all of which are totally unacceptable to the Europeans anyway\nI mean at this point most of it bars this plan could be but he creates other protect potentially some very big economic problems for the United kingdom the fear of kind of walking away um so that's that's the big concern here is can they get a plan that doesn't damage the economy and the the UN parliament will\nAgree to NPR's Frank Langfitt thanks so much happy to do it Steve and you're

small children and they're chasing you and they're asking for food and they're holding up signs that say we also need food we need to need food there was a sense\nA hollow was getting more of the attention than some of the other areas like I'm done with the law which has been very very badly hit and still being explored as to the extent of the damage there but you you you you approach this and and you see obviously you know the the marks of\nA ... destruction along the coast now houses are destroyed on both sides of the road and then as you\nMove into Paul do you see a along the they just nothing but you know houses that have been snapped like twigs UC\nCement homes that are leaning in into the bay and every part of human existence is strewn among ... among the debris so you know something very powerful came through here have you had a chance to talk with survivors yet\nYou know I did and I of course you ask them what was that like where were you um how how is it that you're still standing here um and generally you knew they look at you and they say we were just panicked\nAnd there was no time to act\nIn fact one man said I you know my my sense is just went blank and I

the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't know the president's mockery\nCame at the same time that the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges if possible the agency has been

following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nHappening now breaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described president\nSexual assault allegation but\nAnd didn't catch that this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations but it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's

police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned us on so any potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nWhile determining the future for these sites W.

McDonald testified yesterday Jason Van Dyke is accused of shooting a Seventeen year old sixteen times in what he says was self defense turned\nThe weeds and knife\nLower right side of words crosses horse my left shoulder\nAnd when he did what did you\nSome of the testimony yesterday from Jason Van Dyke Patrick Smith of member station WBFO easy in Chicago\nHas been following the story Patrick good morning the morning okay so I just now I went back and watched this dash cam video again and again ... McDonald is not doing what the police said but\nHe's walking along the street has gotten out of his vehicle he's walking past the officers he's a distance of about a traffic lane away from the nearest one and then suddenly spins and goes down as he's shot that's what a shock to people but it sounds like this officer describes those very events are very differently\nYes he does and and honest and insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um ... you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective\nUm that was it and understand yesterday he talked a lot of things that that he said the dash cam video can't see like McDonald's face and his and he describes his huge eyes and and his and you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke\nAnd then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonald turning toward him where and waving and nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense a requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nIs that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that desk can video to show why he would reasonably be fear for his life like that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nI guess that [noise] excuse me I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat's right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court Raj watchers are the first two weeks of trial or do you think's going to take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um where you really have to testify cop or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self dissent that's what's gonna\nBring it home from the jury we'd all sorts of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how's the cross examination go\nWell um when boxer Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he described the shooting when he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony\nWas contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nAnd I did not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nDid his initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually described in great detail alleged movements five on McDonald's the wave of the knife raising the knife and and it describes observation deck backpedaling from McDonald none of those things are on the dashcam video\nPatrick Smith of member station WBFO easy in Chicago is covering this trial and his reporting among other people's reporting can be heard on that stations podcast called sixteen shots Patrick facts thank you\nFor

evidence against them including social media posts and video\nSurveillance video phone video journalists video from August eleventh in August twelfth we have more digital electronic evidence and video form that investigators did in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing\nThe U.S attorney said there was strong support from Washington for his Thirteen month investigation\nThere's a clear directive from on high that these cases need to be taken very seriously\nAnd he suggested this week's harass might not be the last\nThe FBI's hard at work the Virginia state police as hard at work I

Theresa May gives a speech and just as that last year's version of the same meeting she is trying to get her party behind some plan for Brexit in just two weeks she is supposed to meet with the European Union leaders and find a new plan that they will accept\nNPR's Frank Langfitt is covering all of this either Frank ... is this moment any more desperate than all the other times that conservatives have gotten the failed to agree\nWell at the time is running out as you point out I think that's what it is creating a lot of tension here is there's not a lot of time left on an incredibly difficult and intricate negotiation and the problem for the prime minister has been\nShe can't at the European Union to agree to replant and many people in her own party up there in Birmingham they don't agree with the plan either she gave a speech today a lot of it's going to be about domestic policy but she's she needs to appear strong and confident\nAs the country goes into what many stories would say is the biggest challenge that making them has faced since World War two ah so that's she's going to be coming on actually very soon and we'll be hearing what she has to say what have her critics said well she has a lot of critics but the probably the most prominent one is a man named Boris Johnson he's the former foreign minister\nHe's frankly seen as widely gunning for a ... job and he gave a big speech yesterday where he trashed her plan to leave the European Union she calls for one for more closer relationship with the youth still be able to trade goods seamlessly he\nCalled this a cheat an outrage not what people voted for back in two thousand and sixteen he'd like to see a sharp break with the European Union a more independent and independent Britain and and here's what he said yesterday\nIf we get it wrong nah mean proceed with these undemocratic solution if you made it often offer we will\nPut traps these talks the tedious these toxic tedious business it certainly is toxic how does the prime minister respond to that\nWell she put him down gently uh yesterday on the on the TV he she said for us and that's not how everybody refers to him he's a major figure here always puts on a good show whenever criticisms is that the plan that Mr Johnson's putting out there\nUh she says doesn't really address the need to avoid a new hard border on the island of Ireland this is a huge issue we've been talking about right now as as you know Steve the border is seen less you can't even see it people and goods flow freely across in the Irish people in Ireland they they want it that way\nUm there's a real concern that it could change and she one of the reasons she's trying to continue to have good going back and forth with the EU is to avoid a border of any kind\nOf behind these details I have an image Frank Langfitt of an ocean liner I don't know maybe the Titanic had important iceberg and you've got several people jostling for control of the wheels Boris Johnson being one of them what if what we're rank and file conservative thinking this\nWell I I think that for the moment I think they're going to stick with prime minister may it's it's sort of hard to imagine given the stakes here that they would switch horses in midstream and wall Mr Johnson is a very good performer in terms of speeches there there are concerns that he's not the right guy\nSuch a delicate time I was talking to a man named Anthony Martin he's the chairman of east Hampshire conservative association and and here's how he put it yesterday in Birmingham\nHe would be great to have the big picture great inspiring people but he would need a vote on they can deal with the details [noise]\nWould you want to see him as a future him\nYes and no I'm undecided\nI Am a supporter of Boris Johnson but he he's a law my character\nYou either love him on the um ...\nCharacter so it's it's an expression here in the United kingdom Martin ... is the sticky dark brown foods bread and it's probably Britain's most divisive food\nProduct\nWell suppose they get on the same page and come up with a plan is there any chance that the Europeans are going to accept the ... [noise]\nWell that's that's a very good question and we what was interesting to see it as we haven't seen a new plan they sent her back to the drawing board or the leaders in Brussels and we're waiting to see what she's going to come up with to go see Asians right now seems stalled\nUm and we just got to meeting two weeks to go um and the concern is if they don't come up with a deal they could you take a crash out of the you could do a lot of damage to the economy here\nNPR's Frank Langfitt always a pleasure talking with you sir happy to do it Steve\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test avenue nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gone to a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to\nBut today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nOr some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing system makes sense\nI think carrying the testing\nOf this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about the writing of scenarios it'd be good for the president to be able to speak directly to\nBut this is where a doctor redlin or has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her to think that the president might be using so just just for clinical purposes or create a diversion of the presidency was under threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concerns you're right it would be so one thing about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nThis is Ira Glass this American Life end up coming to Jacksonville even talk that costs seven things I've learned is basically just an excuse to tell

is China getting a shutout in this updated version of NAFTA\nSo China isn't explicitly named in the section that we're talking about but non market economies are not market here means we're at refers to economies where the government controls are manages things that the market would determine and other economies so maybe a setting more heavily subsidizing certain commodity prices for example\nThe new NAFTA says that if one of the three member countries wants to pursue a free trade agreement with the non market economy it has to notify the other two countries and if it does complete a trade deal with a non market economy the other two countries can leave NAFTA within six months and form their own bilateral deal\nTo they're they're talking about China though\nExactly I'm kind of likes to think that it's a market economy and it's actually battling to be recognized as one is at the world Trade Organization but the U.S Europe other countries are fighting that saying China's government still has a really heavy hand and it's a company\nIn the snow or non market language was not in the old enough to\nKnow the countries could always give six months' notice and leave the agreement as President Trump has threatened to do numerous times but this writing in this explicit language for for leaving this explicit reason for leaving now\nWhy is this a a big deal I mean there's countries could always leave NAFTA if they want it\nWell critics think that this amounts to giving us veto power over deals that Canada and Mexico might want to pursue with China I'm a ... a member of ... of

J. C. T. Jacksonville\nTimes reports Trump's father bottled him hundreds of millions of dollars in various ways to avoid some taxes had according to Forbes the president has tried and failed to profit\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the death toll continues to via\nAnd the decades old back story of\nTaking campaign money and putting it into his business is uh it's it's hard to believe it's all good tent\nThere you're reporting about his dropping net worth having to coincide with the New York times huge investigative piece about how Donald Trump got a lot of his wealth according to the times his father funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to him in order to avoid taxes does that reflect what you found too\n[noise] yeah it does it does a ring a bell you know in Nineteen eighty two was the first year that we put together the for four hundred lists of the richest people in America Donald Trump and his father were on it each of them was a two hundred million dollar fortune\nNext year they called us up and said well now it's actually all Donald it's four hundred million dollars to Donald if you take that two hundred million dollar difference in Nineteen eighty three adjusted for inflation up to today that's about five hundred million dollar\nIt's the actual documents found that he had an heritage four hundred and something million dollars from his father so it does seem consistent with what we've seen over the years that Alexander was Forbes thank you thank you\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces questions not only over accusations about his past what about the way he has defended himself\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated an orchestrated political hit\nHim sworn testimony Kavanaugh spun out of conspiracy theory with no evidence saying among other things that the Clinton family was up to go to Jeff Flake one of the very few undecided senators told the Atlantic festival this week that he is troubled\nOr do you give a little leeway because of what he's done through but on the other hand we can't have this on the court we simply can't\nHow important is this question job ashes vice president for Strategic engagement with the American Constitution Society which is a liberal legalized advocacy group mourning\nMourning can you really conclude that Kavanaugh would be unfair on the bench just because he says people are out together\nI think there's a real concern there you know he spent the first week of his uh hearing for the Supreme Court nomination talking a lot about how judges should be neutral arbiters and calling balls and strikes and he went to great lengths to explain the importance of that\nAnd then he ended up on a this past Thursday a ending with a phrase what ... what goes around comes around so I I don't ...\nFor the future if there was a time when he says Democrats are up to get him he may have been hyperbolic but some Democrats are out together and they really don't want it to be on the Supreme Court\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone a sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray it's why they were black robes and they sit behind\nA left turn said literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing a thing what is the manner in which he could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passion about it but\nHis behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking and an arrow were not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from a lead again in the courtroom\nThe judge would be shocked um so I think um you know there was a way for him to make his case\nAnd in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and now it's somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats whether you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody make him\nA no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would file a motion to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument or if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I that I Do know that I Would make that argument that far better than I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nAll because President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court involving him rights\nGo I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the American Constitution Society thanks so much thank\nYou a new State Department visa policy declared that starting

McDonald is not doing what the police said but\nHe's walking along the street has gotten out of his vehicle he's walking past the officers he's a distance of about a traffic lane away from the nearest one and then suddenly spins and\nGoes down as he's shot that is what a shock to people but it sounds like this officer describes goes very events are very differently\nYes she does and and on the stand insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective\nUm that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot about things that that he said the dash cam video can't see like McDonald's face and his and he describes his huge eyes and and his and you know no expression on his face he was looking through\nVan Dyke and then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonald turning toward him with and waving and nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of is that he was reasonably\nIn fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be here for his life life that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nAnd I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court routes boss or the first two weeks of trial or do you think then does that take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um well you really have to testify cop or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to bring it home from the jury we also heard from a lot of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how the cross examination go\nWell um when Boston Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he described the shooting when he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony\nWas contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nInducted not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nIt as initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually described in great detail alleged movements by requirement Donald the waving of the knife raising the knife and and it describes officer Van Dyke backpedaling from McDonald none of those things are on the dashcam video\nPatrick Smith of member
