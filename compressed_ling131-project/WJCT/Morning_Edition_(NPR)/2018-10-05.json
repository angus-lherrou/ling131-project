campus and what could be more worthy [noise] a lot of miss justices have happened and systems had been put in place that are fundamentally unfair\nMiss justices you're you're saying most justices I mean that the accused and have not been treated fairly and I know this is something you have written a lot about ah when this has happened on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what have you seen happen on college campuses you say that I'm just [noise]\nIf you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that isn't titled to support\nAdvocacy help and the people charged with doing that should the leaf you and help you\nBut that can't to bleed over into the investigation and advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth\nAnd we don't believe the accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh adjudication\nI'm young men who say they were\nGrossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds and they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems are based on\nA pre determined assumption\nI at the end of\nThe day I mean that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still\nEncouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you protect the accused without sending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter] I don't have the final answer in some ways we can look at\nKavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way maybe what we

an adversarial process\nAnd there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day\nUm they didn't chip away at her and her credibility remained intact and uh I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this\nI could not believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control [noise]\nThat's on the next radiolab Sunday at noon on eighty nine nine W Jaycee\nT this week everyone got to see a text alert from the president the same can't be said about us taxes lots to discuss on the friday news roundup that's next time on one day\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene today we're marking an anniversary twenty five years ago this week was the last time the federal gas tax went up to today\nThat tax is still what it was in Nineteen Ninety three Eighteen point four cents per gallon and yet the cost of building and maintaining roads and bridges are going up here's more from NPR's David Schaper\nThe first week of October Nineteen Ninety three to top TV shows were home improvement Seinfeld and the first Roseanne the top song was Mariah Carey dream lover you could still buy a Sony Walkman for twenty nine Ninety five gas was just one dollar and eleven cents a gallon and one of the top movies that year start\nBill Murray Frida I'm reliving the same day or a\nGroundhog Day or is about bill Murray's character getting caught in a time loop and he spends decades reliving the same Groundhog Day those of us that have followed ... can't help but feel some of that same repetition\nCarl Davis is with the nonpartisan Institute on taxation in economic policy and he says that's because the federal gas tax is still the same Eighteen point four cents a gallon that it was when Groundhog Day was playing in theaters twenty five years ago\nThe whole reason this tax exists is to keep our roads paved and to keep our bridges from falling down and to do that effectively that needs to collect a sustainable amount of revenue over time and they can't do that if it's just not updated for decades at a time\nWith rising construction and labor costs than less gas being used in more fuel efficient cars the purchasing power of the gas taxes now sixty four percent less than it was it Nineteen\nNinety three Illinois transportation secretary Randy blanket horn says\nThat stagnant federal gas tax means less money to fix and improve his state highways bridges in transit system\nWe're losing revenue another day just because of inflation without new federal money the cap of what we can do is there we are right now simply maintaining what we have\nSo Kevin ... the national conference of state legislatures says well Congress won't raise the federal gas tax states are taking action themselves\nAnd the last five years we've seen many states more than half of them actually enact legislation to increase funding for transportation\nSince two thousand ten thirty three states have raised their own motor fuel taxes Missouri joined them next month that voters approve a ten cents a gallon gas tax hike and Colorado voters are being asked to raise the sales tax to boost transportation funding\nIn many states are also now indexing the gas tax to inflation so it'll go up as construction costs rise some states are also trying alternatives to the gas tax like mileage based user fees that will tax electric cars that also where down roads but don't use gas\nStaying with that Groundhog Day theme Congress does hold hearings from time to time out ways to hike federal funding for transportation but there's almost never vote ears Nevada congresswoman Dena Titus at one such hearing almost two years ago\nWere having the same conversation that same rhetoric named if they see an F a structure we need to look at they asked us just a matter of paying for it but there's no substance to plan\nSo when it comes to congressional inaction on transportation funding and the late baseball legend Yogi Berra might say it's deja vu all over again David Schaper NPR News Chicago\nEarlier this year Apple's chief financial officer said the company would buy back shares of stock one hundred billion dollars worth wow\nWhen you have a trillion dollar company you can do that this is part of a bigger trend of American companies engaging in stock buybacks to explain what exactly they are and why they're sometimes controversial returned or rain or corn and Stacey Vanek Smith of the Planet Money team\nBefore we get into the whole debate over buybacks we should\nExplain what they are probably okay\nIt's when a company decide is going to buy its own stock and it buys that stocks from the people who own the stock from\nIts shareholders and gender the company will pay its shareholders little premium for those shares so why do companies do this we put this question to John Cochran\nI'm a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford\nAnd I also have a blog grumpy\nAnd here's what grumpy John says about buybacks\nA company makes a lot of profit either 'cause they're you know apple and Facebook and money is pouring in the front door or the corporate tax cut increased above so so they got money sitting around\nYou're seeing a sign of our company will manage that they're not going to take this dream of profits and make crazy investments they don't know how to make they're going to give it back to the owners\nSo they can give cash back to the owners AKA the company's shareholders which seems fine right I mean it's better than wasting the money\nThen or Paladino is an economist at the Roosevelt Institute\nShe says that when companies are giving all of their extra cash to shareholders it means they're not investing more money in workers' she's looked specifically at what Wal Mart could have done with the money it's planning to spend on buybacks and twenty Eighteen\nShe calculated it could've increased the pay of one million full time workers by about ten thousand dollars\nPer year so when Walmart says they really can't afford to pay their workers so that families can live above the poverty line we have to look at what they're using their money for and say that that's simply not true\nBut John ... says companies are supposed to answer to their shareholders it's actually their duty is not their duty he says to benefit the wider economy\nThe point of the company has to make money on behalf of its shareholders\nThis does benefit workers because when a company is run efficiently it has to hire people and it has to make those people productive\nAnd in the end high productivity is hell wages are are beat up but I think it's a misunderstanding to think that the company makes money and then decides who to give presents to and maybe give presents to workers or maybe it gets presence to owners or maybe decides to give a bonus to the electric company just to be nice to them uh it's just not how it works\nSo well this debate has been happening buybacks have grown by a lot back in the early eighties ran rules around buybacks were relaxed by the Reagan Administration companies in essence ... five hundred we're spending about four percent of their profits on buybacks in the past few years Lenore says that's jumped to more than fifty percent\nIt will be probably one trillion dollars spent on stock buybacks this year that's more than President Obama spent on the Recovery Act and that's just in twenty Eighteen alone\nSpeaks stock buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny from leaders on Wall street and even from lawmakers in fact a few months ago legislation was\nIntroduced to the Senate that would restrict stock buybacks and take us right back to the Nineteen eighties

initial vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court today a handful of votes most are expected to make a difference\nComing up one MORNING EDITION from and\nYou're listening to eighty nine nine W. J. C. T. Jacksonville your community your world at six in the morning\nSenators are voting after they had a chance to share a single copy of an FBI background investigation just how limited with the bureau's background\nI'm and I'm Steve Inskeep in this hour we're running a former federal prosecutor\nThis hour where you're the winner of the Nobel Peace prize we get a glimpse of the longest Trump is she visits Kenya story corps headlines\nAnd the White House has broad discretion to\nDirect the FBI to follow certainly injure not follow certain leads\nAnd really the question here is you know what what was the scope of the FBI investigation or the president at one point suggests that the FBI was permitted to do whatever it was like um but there's been numerous press reports from various sources suggesting that that was not the case\nI mean James Comey the former FBI Director did this op ed days before this investigation suggesting like this was a moment I mean the FBI was with limited in terms of time and scope it but he said the FBI\nCan do this suggesting it with the independent agency that that would rise up in this moment I mean if indeed the White House was really dictating a lot of this how uncomfortable might that have been for people inside the agency\nWell that certainly could have been ... uncomfortable I think age is you know may have been telling themselves well this is you know we're only we're doing\nOur job in the sense that this is a background check and we're following whatever leads we're being told to follow 'em but I you know there are certainly may have been some discomfort and I think that maybe the result of all of that may have resulted in the leaks that we saw so\nThroughout the course of the investigation it became apparent from various news sources that certain\nAnd um individuals are not being interviewed that um the the the FBI investigation was very limited\nThat they had been instructed not to follow certain leads and so on at least some of those um some of those pieces of information may have a parent to have come from from people within the bureau\n[noise] so if for example um you know there were witnesses who were put forward by Christine budget for the first Kavanaugh accuser um the FBI did not talk to\nThem it if that is true and if as you say the White House was sort of dictating how this happened um what was credible about this report\nOr certainly the FBI um I have no doubt that the FBI did their job and interviewing the individuals that they were\nTasked with interviewing 'em and so you know we have an idea of some of the people that at the very least who were interviewed by the FBI for example Mr Mir as a mark judge and so on and I have no doubt that the FBI\nOr did their best to interview those people within the best of their ability and and frankly that does move the ball or because\nFor example until this a ... mark judge it not been interviewed\nBy a by anyone he had just written head as attorney write a short statement to the committee so this this does move the ball forward but it it it is I think I'm too everyone's detriment that it it doesn't resolve all the questions that we have that everyone was that interviewed within the week\nI Wish which could have happened to the FBI is very considerable resources and and presumably could have could have done so it certainly could have interviewed judge Kavanaugh on dark Ford who were not interview\nLet me just ask you a judge Kavanaugh wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal yesterday defending his record dumb also defending what what he described with his in his own words I mean very emotional testimony what what did you make of of that\nOver those very unusual for um a judicial nominee to write an op ed I Can't recall it ever occurring in my lifetime I'm so that's that's the first thing it's certainly quite a moment\nA it was I think it I I think it I was pleased that this has become an issue because I think for each each ... to me it should have been a nonpartisan issue that\nUm both sides should have felt that it was inappropriate for a judge to make the sort of partition comments that he did during the hearing or that said he suggested\nThat he was emotional and so on and those were his prepared remarks so I thought that a run our former federal prosecutor and not to ... thanks as always\nThank you\nWell we're not out of the recipients of the Nobel Peace prize the announcement came this morning from the Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway they are Dr Denis ... and ... both of worked on the issue of

the war in Iraq or during their war I should say in Iraq and Syria\nAnd she escaped and became a really a local ... a spokesperson for\nUh for the victims of the source of these sorts of crimes\nOn the committee says that they selected these two for making crucial contributions for focusing attention on and fighting war crimes uh he's seen as the helper who devoted his life depending victims and she as a witness who speaks bravely about the horrific abuses against\nHer I was just thinking about that what a remarkable thing to do not only to escape to to survive that ordeal but to talk about it afterwards something that's very difficult for anyone to discuss to talk about it publicly an advocate for people\nAbsolutely I mean she she is one of the few many of them are are too afraid to speak and she was a last year named as a UN ambassador for her efforts are basically the first goodwill ambassador for the dignity of survivors of human trafficking\nAnd how to Dr ... rise to global prominence well\nHe is Dr miracle again for his just absolute skill and his absolute devotion to these women and victims of\nOf gang rape in war in his country and ah he basically the committee says that he's the foremost most unifying symbol both nationally and internationally of the struggle to and sexual violence in war in armed conflict\nWhen you say in war is this dangerous work to be helping the victims of sexual violence and a wartime situation\nYeah absolutely I he has faced a many death threats and uh basically uh there's one in September two thousand twelve or he gave a speech decrying the horrors of mass rape in Congo at the un and then a month later gunman came into his home and tried to kill him his wife and their two daughters\nHis guard was the only person that managed to save them and after the shootout uh basically they played the family play dead and then he left Congress shortly thereafter\nWhile I'm Still alive to resemble Nile bill a prize is this the Nobel committee's comment in a sense on the me too movement around the world [noise]\nAbsolutely uh this is uh something uh basically the committee said that sexual violence is is really important to stop

the individual that Dr bloody Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault they hadn't been interviewed before just made of a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just generally\nEvery interview conducted by the FBI leads to additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist with NPR pursue leave after they\nHear them in interviews so do the FBI agents what happened here was that if I Would circle described as to who they could interview and how long they add and\nAs a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate record\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Kevin\nThat's incorrect so is the contention that there is no hint of misconduct there is a matter of public record powerful\nTony in this interview although it's not in court in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific I wouldn't than other lead that should have been pursued about her are nowhere here including by the way it Connecticut constituent who had information that\nJudge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their\nIntentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nLet me just contradicted and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation R U alleging there is solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach but here too important point first of all this report should be made public\nSo you and I can engage in a real

tell me more about that and how it's going we did\nWe joined that effort and we have publicly committed there to provide training and scale development to at least a million of our US associates over the next five years and that's going to be through education and training and you know it's really an extension of something we started back in two thousand Fifteen\nIf you're working you have to find

future of work we funded a study for example that found that two thirds of the fifty million people in service sector frontline jobs today have literacy gaps and three quarters of the people have numerous see gaps they're already in the workforce\nSo what we're trying to do is make it the norm not just at Walmart but across employers in general that people can learn on the job\nSo we've come at it a couple of different ways one is through our own training programs and then what we've also done is a program that allows people to get access to four year degrees a dollar a day on their own time\nMisspoke often I have to ask you why is this Wal Mart's problem\nIt's in the interest in any business to address the challenges and opportunities that\nThat have to do with the systems they rely

ahead to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court now however that vote goes it is certainly not going to be the end of the story exactly a year ago today Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault\nIn an investigation into New York times the me too movement is radically changing discourse around women and sexual harassment the Kavanaugh nomination\nHas led to another movement and hash tag the hash tag believe survivors movement now our next guest has some complicated feelings about that\nEmily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic and she wrote a piece titled the problem with ... believe survivors and she joins us this morning thanks for taking the time\nGlad to be here so why did you decide to write this piece\nI Am a big supporter of may to of women especially what we're seeing long silenced women come forward and tell their stories\nI think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of French and conversation\nAnd people who come forward absolutely need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they see that out and they should be believed within that community my concern is that\nThis ... cannot apply when a specific man is accused and some kind of\nEducation investigation or life altering effects happened we simply can't believe one party over another uh\nJust on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works\nSo what what are you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell\nWomen and tells survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed if they come forward but then also add but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence like how do you\nHow do you handle that well as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here is something that happened to me\nAnd they're leaving in it that and and they've been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago I thought about it it's not going to do any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of\nIssues and that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings when someone is accused\nWe need some way to ...\nEight the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying a as Lucy K yeah what these women said is right I did it\nUh often times we don't ah and I think we can draw some\nConcerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a revolution in title nine this is the federal law that governs that that means no a sex discrimination on campus and under this has been\nA a\nAn effort to in an effort to eliminate sexual assaults on campus and what could be more worthy a lot of missed justices have happened and systems have been put in place that are fundamentally unfair\nMiss justices you're you're saying most justices I mean that the accused of have not been treated fairly and I know this was something you have written a lot about ah when does this happen on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what if you've seen happen on college campuses these days but I'm just\nIf you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support\nAdvocacy help and the people charged with doing that should the leaf you and help you\nBut that can't to bleed over into the investigation and advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth\nAnd we don't believe he accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh\nAdjudication I'm young men who say they were\nGrossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds and they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the courts saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems are based on\nA pre determined assumption I at the end of\nThe day I mean that that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still\nEncouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you protect the accused without sending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter] I don't have the final answer in some ways we can look at\nThis Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way maybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nReluctantly came forward I think the country was helped by having a public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it isn't adversarial ... process and\nThere was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day\nIf you want to move to Japan you'll need to know a few things to fit\nJapanese people are more modest and reserved in public

Hi\nAlright so specifically what's changed with China's individual income\nTax well starting this month people earning less than eighty seven hundred dollars a year will not have to pay income tax that increase from the previous threshold of six thousand dollars a year\nOr so less out to the tax people more for the consumer are they going to lash out and spend a lot of money with all this extra disposable income\nAnd not exactly the simple reason is the cost of living is going up particularly in housing we reached a taxpayer named young men who is in the eastern Chinese city of ... he's working as a project manager at an auto parts factory now with this tax change he says he'll be able to keep an extra fifty eight dollars a month\nBut are now a gun to put on the\nDrugs though he says an extra fifty eight dollars could buy a pair of shoes or two pairs of pants and she says the tax changes it\nIt's a nice idea but it's not really going to help him get what he wants most which is to put a down payment on a property\nAlright so changing the taxes is a way to boost consumer spending other strategies that the Chinese government this are pursuing\nWell the government is also promising new individual tax deductions in January\nBut analysts argue that the increase is still far too modest to boost consumer spending because at the same time in January China is changing the

senators were holding initial vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court today a handful of votes in most are expected to make the difference\nComing up one MORNING EDITION from and\nYou're listening to eighty nine nine ... do you change the teen Jacksonville and your community your world it's a friday October\nOr voting after they had a chance to share a single copy of an FBI background investigation just how limited with the bureau's background of immigrants\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in this hour we question a former federal prosecutor and democratic Senator Richard\nAlso this hour we learned the names of the recipients of the Nobel Peace prize and get a glimpse of a lot of Trump visits Kenya and still record headline\nAnd really the question here is you know what what was the scope of the FBI investigation or the president at one point suggests that the FBI was permitted to do whatever it would like 'em but there's been numerous press reports from various sources suggesting that that was not the case\nI mean James Comey the former FBI Director did this op ed days before the investigation suggesting like this was a moment I mean the FBI was with limited in terms of time and scope it but he said the FBI\nCan do this suggesting it with the independent agency that that would rise up in this moment I mean if indeed the White House was really dictating a lot of this how uncomfortable might that have\nAnd for people inside the agency well that certainly could have been ... uncomfortable I think age is you know may have been telling themselves well this is you know we're only we're doing\nOur job in the sense that this is a background check and we're following whatever leads we're being told to follow 'em but uh I you know there are certainly may have been some discomfort and I think that maybe the result of all of that may have resulted in the leaks that we saw so\nThroughout the course of the investigation it became apparent from various news sources\nThat certain individuals are not being interviewed that um the the the FBI investigation was very limited\nThat they had been instructed not to follow certain leads and so on at least some of those um some of those uh pieces of information may have appeared to have come from from people within the bureau\n[noise] so if for example um you know there were witnesses who were put forward by Christine Blasey Ford the first Kavanaugh accuser hum the FBI did not talk to\nThem if that is true and if as you say the White House was sort of dictating how this happened um what was credible about this report\nOr certainly the FBI I'm a I have no doubt that the FBI did their job and interviewing the individuals that they were\nTasked with interviewing 'em and so you know we have an idea of some of the people that at the very least who were interviewed by the FBI for example Mr Mir as a mark judge and so on and I have no doubt that the FBI or did their best to interview those people within the best of their ability and\nAnd frankly that does move the ball or because\nFor example until this a ... mark judge it not been interviewed\nBy a by anyone he had he had just written had his attorney write a short statement to the committee so this this does move the ball forward\nUm but it it it is I think I'm too everyone's detriment that it it doesn't resolve all the questions that we have that everyone was an interview with in the week I Wish which could have happened to the FBI is very considerable resources and and presumably could have could have done so it certainly could have interviewed judge Kavanaugh on dark\nFord who were not interview\nLet me just ask you a judge Kavanaugh wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal or yesterday defending his record dumb also defending a what what he described was his in his own words I mean very emotional testimony what what did you make of of that\nOver those very unusual for um a judicial nominee to write an op ed I Can't recall it ever occurring in my lifetime I'm so that's that's the first thing it's certainly quite a moment a it was I think it I I think it I was pleased that\nThis has become an issue because I think for each each ... to me it should have been a nonpartisan issue that um both sides should have felt that it was inappropriate for a judge to make the sort of partition comments that he did during the hearing or that said he suggested\nThat he was emotional and so on and those were his prepared remarks so I thought that run our\nFormer federal prosecutor and not to

turned into sex slaves or by ISIS or during the war in Iraq or during their war I should say in Iraq and Syria\nAnd she escaped and became a really a local ... a spokesperson for\nUh for the victims of the source of these sorts of crimes\nOn the committee says that they selected these two for making crucial contributions for focusing attention on in fighting war crimes uh he's seen as the helper who devoted his life to defending victims and she as a witness who speaks bravely about the horrific abuses against her\nI was just thinking about that what a remarkable thing to do not only to escape to to survive that ordeal but to talk about it afterwards something that's very difficult for anyone to discuss to talk about it publicly and advocate for people\nAbsolutely I mean she she is one of

E. L. dot com\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News good morning I'm David Greene in Culver City California\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC to hear Republicans tell U.S Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a victim President Trump has mocked his main accuser Christine Blasey Ford who says that she was sexually assaulted by him decades ago and in Rochester, Minnesota yesterday President Trump cast the Supreme Court voted purely partisan terms\nDemocrats have been trying\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh says [noise] the very first second he was sitting down and it was announced for one simple reason he is an incredible intellect\nKavanaugh himself said that he was the victim of a conspiracy of Democrats seeking revenge on behalf of the Clintons yesterday the nominees vaguely backed off of that a surge in saying that he said some things he shouldn't have and his public testimony although we did not specify what those things were\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal is on the Senate Judiciary committee which has been considering Kavanaugh's nomination which now goes before the full Senate Senator good morning good morning you thank you for having me so let's note that you ever had an opportunity as other senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information\nAre looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what's missing\nThere are no interviews with some of the really key witnesses including the Occupy the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other witnesses\nThere is evidence that should have been pursued lead should have been followed answers that should have been thought and it has all the appearance of a white was handled\nLet let me just ask about that senator because although it is true that there is not a very large number of witnesses who ride the uh who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault they hadn't been interviewed before just made of a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally\nEvery interview conducted by the FBI leads to additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist with NPR pursue leave after they\nHear them in interviews so do the FBI agents what happened here was that the FBI with circle described as to who they could interview and how long they add and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate report\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is the contention that there is no hint of misconduct there is a matter of public record powerful testimony in this interview although it's not in court if in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific eyewitness than other\nLeads they should have been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way in Connecticut constituent who had information about judge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape there\nAnd to a New Yorker interview and\nThat will let me just contradicts let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him and Deborah\nRamirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation are you a legendary solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach but here too important points first of all this report should be made public\nSo you and I can't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention them making can be supported by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court justice\nSaid that his performance at the committee last Thursday was disqualified self getting arrogant\nAcrimonious frightening demeanor that he brought to the court in many ways on math\nThe judge and showed us the real man\nWill have to stop the conversation there are so much to say and so if you will get to say it on the Senate for this morning senator
