and um ... it's a it's all about the base as they say he's a he's going to to rile up the base\nAll about the base NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith she also hosts the NPR politics podcast thanks Tam You're welcome [noise]\nAre we're moving on now to a serious data breach at Google it happened earlier this year but Google decided not to tell hundreds of thousands of users that their personal information may have been compromised\nTheir according to a Wall Street journal report there was this software glitch in Google Plus that was Google's unsuccessful answer to Facebook so this glitch enabled outside developers to collect a user's profile data and also the private data of users friends\nAnd Google executives decided for some reason not to make this problem public dead McMillan is with me in Studio he's one of the reporters who broke the story a dead thanks for coming in hiding morning so how long were users exposed for and what information might these outside developers have been able to collect on them\nJust for the software bug existed on fix for more than two years it began in twenty Fifteen and was eventually fixed in March of this year we believe that it affected personal data that people entered into Google Plus profiles that included their name off\nAnd things like relationship status birth date gender straightforward profile information all of that could have been potentially collected by outside developers\nBut at the developers would not have been able to read my email for for instance right it's just this profiling information I suppose this was discovered last spring the big question is why did Google executives just go public now why didn't they say something about it then\nThat is a big question and a reporting its end of this ... this is a relatively small number of users they're saying that they think maybe half a million users are affected the real concern is why they didn't disclose this they knew potentially these are affected and they they did some digging they looked into\nWhether or not you know developers had misuse this data they found ultimately no evidence so they decided that that was a reason not to tell anybody we don't know if any data was misused so we have an obligation to tell people the real reason that we thank you know swayed their decision was because they were they were afraid that how does it look\nThey're afraid of the the PR consequences and potential regulatory scrutiny of what was going on with Facebook in the news and the Cambridge Analytica breach that basically they would be dragged into that same story if they came out with us\nSo we sort of have to if you're one of those users who's information was compromise you sort of have to trust Google when they say and nothing bad was done with it there is no law that says if there is a breach the company's gotta tell consumers [noise]\nThere's a a patchwork of laws there's there Patrick state laws and there's a there's a new European law that addresses is\nThe problem is these laws hinge on whether or not the company knew that data was improperly access in this case Google as pleading ignorance they're saying we don't know we have no evidence the data was access so we therefore have no obligation\nGoogle's chief privacy officer Keith Enright testified before a Senate panel two weeks ago and he talked about consumer trust let's hear what he had to say\nWe acknowledge that we have made mistakes in the past from which we've learned and improved our privacy program we understand that the foundation of our business is trust based on your reporting is that believable\nI think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to regain user trust there is a lot of people questioning\nHow Google handled this incident and I think there are a lot of people generally look at these big ... that companies right now who have vast influence over a lot of data and our digital lives and I guess a big question about use your trust the laws one thing but\nOur relationship with these companies in our trust with them it's probably a bigger responsibility and that you're going to have to start to see them grapple with these issues on day to day\nBasis and we should note that Google has set is finally disabling Google Plus altogether dead McMillan covers Google for the wall Street Journal and he reported this story with fellow journal reporter Robert ... thanks\nAll right until yesterday the head of Interpol the international police organization based in France was a man named among Hong way he's from China\nRight but a few days ago in France ... wife reported that he had gone missing while he was on a visit to his native China and then yesterday among re surface and announce that he was resigning from Interpol this after apparently being detained by Chinese authorities on charges of corruption\nNPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz has been following this story he's with us now Hi Rob good morning All right so what do we know about ...\nAmong hallway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he\nBecame the first Chinese head of Interpol and it's an election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt to it escaped China\nAs it turns out among himself is under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWhat China's government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how his intention unfolded\nHas come from his wife gray smog in September twenty fifth the day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood even knife suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported in missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and they own friends wearing triple is headquartered in here's what she said\nWe had to go to the half of my children are all the wives\nAnd children husbands and fathers so that they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back\nTurned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police\nWell when she talks about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government's anti corruption campaign it was launched by paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and it snowed hundreds of thousands of FIFA officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julia in Congo highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China's security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nSo by removing money from the presidency of Interpol China is going to lose a lot of sway inside of this organization that much is clear what does this mean for Interpol and its relationship with China\nWill Interpol has announced his resignation and appointed an acting president but even before this happened China's use of Interpol under his presidency was starting to raise a lot of red flags they were using his position to target people that China wanted in jail but that didn't have any\nEvidence of any wrongdoing on their case and and they were vetoed by other members of Interpol or in this case with lung is a good example of how China's own messy politics who sort of spilling over into international organizations really\nInteresting NPR's Rob Schmitz from Shanghai thanks so much ...

what work was she doing before she died\nShe had just started on a new TV program called detector and she was looking into allegations\nOf fraud or in southeast Europe particularly um embezzlement of a fun thing so she had not being along in the job but she obviously or was it was touching on very sensitive subjects which is you know corruption\nAnd do you see a clear connection between that investigation and and um her murder\nAt this point it's too early to say that you know that's why we want the place to do a credible job of investigating this because I'm In the past that's not always being the case\nUm if if there is a link between him and I'm reporting she will be a journalist in the European Union to have been killed in the last month\nFor doing investigative reporting\nAnd and let me ask you about that I mean to investigative journalists killed in the EU in addition to her now um is\nThere is some thing happening is there a climate in Europe that that could explain I mean I Know it's not tons of people but I mean this this certainly seems like maybe the beginning of a really disturbing trend\nWell what you did you grow up more journalists doing more investigative journalism you have a whole network of organizations that have banded together through newspapers through online sites\nThat are doing deep dive into hum corruption organized crime human trafficking and that is upsetting a lot of people particularly corrupt officials and politicians\nAnd criminals and so and in a way I think it's because journalists are doing their job while and successfully that they stood up a lot of from\nA lot of trouble for a these are these criminals in Europe that that's one thing and then then the other thing is there in certain countries\nIt's just not enough enforcement of the law and the rampant impunity which means that you can sometimes a silence the critical journalists are closed down an investigation by having that journalist killed because that sends a warning at a very chilling message to others not to do the same thing\nAre you optimistic that the situation can get safer for journalists that I mean there could be better enforcement of the laws as I mean or European countries paying attention to this and I'm willing to to work to make things better\nThey have to I'm already these this murder has been condemned by a city or officials in

Paul reminds her that she has the music inside of her\nThey start saying and they find the voice within that uh pacify them and makes the storms seem a little less frightening\nAnd you know catch when I thought about that\nOr you basically\nTelling the story of the blues this music where you'd have people with nothing or are close to nothing looking to music within themselves when times are their toughest\nWell I I Know for me that in my darkest hour there's always been a song that has helped me to transcend\nAnd certainly the story of country music and the story of the blues which I really want in the same the story of hardworking and oftentimes impoverished people looking for that boat across dark waters\nYou chose to make your characters African American and the illustrations in this book where and why was that decision\nWhen I first heard this story I heard it from a woman of Cherokee dissent a woman named Lorraine she had a pet crow and she was a kid on her dad's form\nAnd this crow used to steal everything and bury it all around the farm and they'd find a little bits of string or or um cellophane or ... or so in my mind Lorraine was a hillbilly girl of Cherokee descent\nNow it took a long time to get this book finished um but really the big part of the time was getting it published and uh and then finding an illustrator\nAnd it wasn't until maybe four years passed before the publisher said sorry catch we can't really find the right illustrator would you like to search and I've found on the listing of a local arts college Higgins bond urine\n[noise] well it's a really important question I think that a lot of pollsters at least on the Democratic side are being more conservative in how they are waiting the data that they're receiving in and perhaps presenting a more pessimistic outlook than they might otherwise have\nI Know also that many pollsters are taking steps that they hadn't taken before\nTo more carefully choose the people who they're interviewing for their surveys because part of the problem as far as we can tell coming out of sixteen was we weren't always capturing per se snapshot of the electorate\nBut I think what this comes down to at the end of the day is the polls are at best just a snapshot anytime we still have a ways to go people started voting in some states but\nTo rest on our morals or to take for granted that we're going to win the house it it's not smart and we have to continue to press and fight this election out every single day\n... campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in ...\nSixteen talking to him about the Democratic party and the party strategy heading into this election thanks so much we always appreciate it my pleasure thank you\nAnd interest hammer Keith has been listening to that conversation she covers the White House for NPR hey there Tam the morning when you were very involved in covering the twenty sixteen campaign that sounds like a ... team Clinton still thinking about what they might have taken for granted and what not wanting to to repeat that in twenty eight team\nYeah and and one thing that stood out to me is he talks about uh how Republicans may have done some damage for themselves among women a female voters in the cabin outside\nYou know at the Clinton campaign and others thought that President Trump had then candidate Trump had done a lot of damage with female voters uh with that Access Hollywood video that came out just about a year ago are just about two years ago right um but ultimately white women\nVoted for Donald Trump they they broke for for Trump in the end um and and what we've seen in a lot of our polling is that gender is important but party is everything\n... well let's talk about President Trump for a moment because I Know Kevin we heard him at the White House um as he did the ceremonial swearing in saying he wants to move past\nThe bitterness he does not feeling bitter as he takes on this new job President Trump seems to be taking a of of of less pleasant tone when he's out there campaigning about this\nYeah well a cabinet is going to be on the spring is on the Supreme Court a President Trump is trying to win a mid term and are trying to keep his party in power and\nThe what they discovered is that Republican voters were fired up by the fight and um and you know the emotion of happiness and contentment is not as strong as the emotion of anger and frustration\nAnd and resentment and President Trump and Republicans want to keep that feeling going keep their voters upset and angry because they believe that will get them out to the polls and get them voting Republican\nI mean you know as well as I Do are living in a world where you never know when what seems like a big story of a sudden we're going to go away and there's going to be the next big story but\nAny sense of of whether this Kevin a fight is going to remain kind of in the talking points and agendas of both parties in in this one month that we have left or are there are other issues that are going to be coming up the voters going to really can be thinking about\nWell there are absolutely other issues up in the end\nIt's hard to say whether issues will will decide this or whether it will really just be a battle of enthusiasm and\nAnd and the fight over President Trump and and Trump ism but one thing that keeps coming up um that hasn't gotten a ton of attention is health care\nUm and and that is an issue where you have a Republicans are coming in and saying well we don't want to take away your pre existing conditions there affirmatively going out there doing ads about pre existing conditions because\nDemocratic candidates have made it such an issue um and and it's it's resonating with voters\nAnd Paris timer Keith Tam thanks a lot You're welcome [noise]\n[noise] state regulators in Arkansas have banned the use of a weed killer that's popular not just there but across the country this chemical often hurts other crops and wildlife but many farmers in Arkansas are defying the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story\nThis year's confrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by mayor rolled out a new way to kill weeds and told farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and caught and they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die ... of member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide please\nHonestly I don't think anybody in the whole world dreamed that ... could create such an issue brings so many farmers against farmers\nThat gamut in stay where it belonged it drifted across the landscape and injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\n... known your neighbor and your friend that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant board asked the most dramatic limits on campus and the whole country no die Kemba spring during the growing season the summer I called Terry fuller back see how it was going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees and people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year ... just been a sad situation and um you know really an unbelievable situation\nThe plant and boards investigators tried to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation\nI talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive\nA couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way and by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules like taboo now\nPersonally I don't believe his brain dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray I mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming\nSo he didn't plant those new dot camera tolerant crops he got rid of weeds with other chemicals\nI use not one drop dot camera show everybody says it can't be done it's a myth\nAnd then he saw the leaves of his soybean plants curling up I can but had blown in from some other farmers field\nDo I go out and try to which people inside and I'm not doing that but I have the legal right as a farmer to keep a crop that is not damaged by somebody else's spray\nThat legal right may not be enough though if other farmers insist on spraying dicamba he may have to also plant those new dot camera tolerant soybeans because they won't\nGet injured and then he'd be tempted to spray dicamba to\nDan Charles NPR News\nThis is NPR News\n... personal injury attorneys are dedicated

this this uh you know the security patches ... existed\nOr didn't do right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that their their privacy might have been at risk why\nYeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that\nThere is no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users but our reporting shows that there was another factor at play\nWhich was they were worried about the repercussions of coming forward with this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the face but Cambridge Analytica data breach in just happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny\nOf Facebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation and a bigger way\nWe'll have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThere they took it pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big step they're also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in ah some data privacy potential problems\nOr they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like gee now there are there are a lot of different apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers\nBut they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent\nA situation like this from happening again\nOn your reporting should people\nGoogle that care about privacy I think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust 'em it in this situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people and in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you can Google Keep the

at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the

to be aware of trapped bystanders he might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your co workers that are just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be

version of Google Plus it's social network but some sauce and the answer to Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information\nOf hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company decided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke the story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiker morning\nSo can you start by telling us about this flood at you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year or people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date\n... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affected number is of user is small it's only about potentially half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of it but the real questions that are reporting focused on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches flaw existed or didn't\nDo right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that that their privacy might have been at risk\nWhy yeah so there's sort of the story that their talent which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there was no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users but our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming\nForward with this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the face but Cambridge Analytica data breach and just happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny of Facebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation in a bigger way ...\nWhat have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening enough\nSo that they're they took a pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big stuff there also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in ah some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like Gmail there are there are a lot of different apps\nThat can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers\nBut they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent\nA situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google that care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal who joined colleagues in writing the story he was working with us\nRubber McMillan thanks much for joining us very much for having me\nIn Alaska a ballot measure is cutting right to the heart of the state's identity it's putting Alaskans love for salmon against another powerful force the oil and mining industries Elizabeth horrible has the story she's with Alaska's energy desk and NPR's energy and environment team\nUsing his boat across whiskers creek Mike

the stand for salmon campaign for a ballot measure aimed at protecting the state's most iconic fish walking along the creek would says he thinks it's a long overdue change\nFish scale is friendship too far in favor of of development and industry and and we're just trying to pull it back towards the center\nAlaska as some of the most valuable salmon fisheries left in the world but wouldn't other ballot supporters say the state's laws protecting salmon are weak putting them at risk especially with a number of large new mines in oil developments in the works\nIf it passes Alaska would enact a much tougher permitting process for big projects in salmon habitat among other things it would set strict standards for restoring salmon streams if they're disturbed and the companies don't follow the rules they could face criminal penalties would acknowledge is that in a state like Alaska it's a big ask\nWhen you start doing something like this\nIs really kind of\nSome in your nose at the big guys you know\nFor decades Alaska's economy has depended on industry dollars and oil and mining companies hate this initiative banded together under the name stand for Alaska they're backing a campaign to stop it running a blitz of ads like this lawyer\nIt claimed to protect their habitat\nActually improved as burdensome new regulations that flu or stop Alaska projects\nCompanies have poured millions
