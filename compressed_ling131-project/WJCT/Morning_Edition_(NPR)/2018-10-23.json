Steve Inskeep aside from reckon towns hurricane Michael\nFields in Congress we will survey farm\nSome smaller cities are seeing sudden grow we report on the rise of Worcester, Massachusetts\nHe just to see a cobra twenty third day in Nineteen eighty seven when the U.S Senate rejected the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork\nAnd we should say that in the past caravans like this when they get to the border they present themselves at ports of entry and apply for asylum they're not storming the border like the president suggesting\nNPR's Scott Detrow thanks so much thank you\nI President Trump says he plans to end a thirty year old arms control treaty with Russia Edison the treaty that helped to mark the end of the Cold War\nYeah he's a national security adviser John Bolton to Moscow where he's scheduled to meet president Vladimir Putin's today trashing the treaty is a sign that world powers could be returning to an arms race mentality\nNPR's Geoff Brumfiel is with us in Studio he's been reporting on this new class of missiles that could help to define that race they are known as hyper sonic weapons good morning Geoff good morning what is a hyper sonic weapon\nWell the first thing to say is that is not covered by this arms control treaty or actually any treaty because it's still in the research and development phase\nBut essentially this is a weapon that can go very very fast five times the speed of sound or more and not only that but it can fly an airplane so this is an incredibly fast potentially very stealthy weapon that can sort of maneuver around defenses to strike it's target\nSo kind of a worrying weapon if weapons or something you worry about weapons are always worry yeah he's been to the air\nOr is this testing sites how far along are countries in actually producing these these kind of weapons\nRight so I went to one of the Air Force's wind tunnels where they're doing some prototyping and I actually can't tell you much because the morning I shut up I got a text message\nThey told me a we're doing classify testing today we won't let you in but they did let me talk to some of the people there and what I can say is that they are definitely increasing the pace of testing and um [noise]\nThey're not the only ones the Chinese and Russians are also doing a lot of testing China did a test back in August Russia was talking about its tests earlier this year so this is a weapon that appears to be on the fast track at least among the world powers\nI mean that brings up a really interesting question right is it are we seeing the beginning of of a kind of knew arms race I think\nWell I'm Mike Griffin who's the head of the Pentagon's R and D a sort of division was was talking about high percentage weapons last month and this is what do you have to say about it\nWe did the groundbreaking research they've chosen to weaponize it we need to respond\nAnd the day there is China and Russia so basically I mean that does sound a bit like an arms race to me we started it they're keeping to do it so we gotta keep going\nUm you know I think that this is a case of everyone is investing heavily in a new weapons technology and it's not the only case Russia's developing a lot of new systems right now some of which are pretty wild\nConscious asked what is the point of hyper sonic weapon a missile that gets to its target even faster as adjust that missile defenses which don't always work anyway would work even less with a super fast weapons\nWell exactly I mean this is a good question arms control a experts say there isn't much point in the U.S developing when we already have a lot of capabilities um China and Russia are definitely actress perennially worried about missile defense and so\nThey see it as a way to get around us missile defenses especially in the future or missile defenses grow more sophisticated\n... NPR's Geoff Brumfiel thanks so much thank you [noise]\nAlright Saudi Arabia is still trying to get it story straight on what exactly happened to journalist Tim ... G meanwhile turkey has been slowly releasing details about his murder\nSlowly Turkey's president ... said today he will reveal what happened at the Saudi critic and journalist when he went to the consulate in Turkey to obtain marriage paperwork\nOn October second this issue as you may know has become the center of a tense relationship between two regional powers and or to one could see this as an opportunity to gain some leverage over the ... facto Saudi leader crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nNPR's Peter Kenyon is with us from Istanbul where he's been following this story Hi Peter I know so why has president or the one taking such an interest in what happened to ...\nWell basically he doesn't have any choice I mean the world is focused on this killing ... a one newspaper columnist wrote a last week or so a\nTurkey is not the bad guy this time as you noted this has not been the greatest place for journalists or other commentators have tried to make a distinction between jailing journalists and killing them but anyway there's been a steady drip of evidence from the Turkish investigation\nAnd analysts say it's very much and Turkey's interest to be aggressive thorough go wherever the evidence leads ah so far it's pointing toward Saudi Arabia to show was a steady government critic at a column in the Washington Post\nAnd the question still remains was it a rogue operation is Riyad claims or did the Saudi leadership out of hand and ordering it\nAt the Saudi foreign minister has basically repeated and Indonesia that they want to hold those responsible to account a Turkish foreign minister today raised the possibility of an international investigation possibly by the United nations\nAnd meanwhile everyone is saying we have more information and we're prepared to release it do we know what Turkey's got [noise]\nAnd they have ah been giving little bits out day by day there is a known that I Know who's seen it all who's talking publicly about it at the CIA director was dispatched to uncle ... presumably to see and hear what exactly turkey does have\n'em but basically the evidence we are seeing calls into doubt the Saudis story that this was a brawl was an accident a real killers that has nothing to do with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nOr we're seeing evidence of calls from the consulate to key advisor to the crown prince a and a report even that he ordered the killing a\nPlus there's been footage of a Saturday consular official a burning papers the day after ... killing ... and also footage of an apparent a body double a man dressed in ... closed leaving the consulate on the day he went and so that all speaks to pre meditation and attempts to cover up\nHe's won using this situation as an opportunity to kind of confront crown prince Mohammed bin Salman [noise]\nWe're going to watch that closely it's an important aspect of all is a Saudi Arabian turkey a long time regional rivals different foreign policy views of the Saudis along with the Israelis have been seen as America's top allies in the middle east turkey is an important ally part of NATO\nOr now with this widespread international criticism of Saudi Arabia this could be an opportunity for air to launder raised turkey star a bit as a key Muslim power a vital Mideast player\nOr it would if that happened to be something of a jolt to U.S foreign policy though I mean turkey could never replace Saudi Arabia is a U.S partner in confronting Iran for instance so it's not clear this will fundamentally altered the regional power structure but people will be watching it closely\nNPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul Peter thanks so much Thanks Noel\n\nThis is NPR News\nWilson children's hospital presents the eleven Daniel pediatric bio ethics conference

thousands of people took the streets of London recently to demand what they called the people's vote on Brexit they want to vote again\nAt the same time prime minister Theresa May is trying to complete breakfast and she is in some political danger members of her own conservative party here said to be plotting against are forcing some in the opposition Labour Party to defend her ears pierced arm or a shadow bread but here's cure storm or the shadow breakfast minister\nSome of the ... some comments about crime as of this weekend attributed to conservatism pays ... as a nothing short of disgraced [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank morning hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave the ... you\nKnow it's interesting Steve I'm answer she ... the prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says Ninety five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge so we talk it's about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches up you know part of the a party you and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. ah but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything up\nSo with all of this pressure on Theresa May from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of our party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news is it's very hard language isn't really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom um\nBut the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been at this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here um and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to date punches\nA but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a and other election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain Lauren independence from the radio but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned do without and protested fray people's vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWhat they were talking about there is here with here that they basically said they say you know two thousand sixteen when disposed was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods other Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back to working to pay for healthcare\nNone of that to happen and Brexit negotiations are what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely that Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to shift so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London [noise]\nAll right now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized\nVan that's heading for the United states\nThere are dramatic pictures showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras and these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR but he's not as big an event is news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S and if they're like people in past caravans\nThey'll probably requests legal entry but remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all is because of this symbolic use being made to these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central Americans suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelm the states he kept a caravan in the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migrations\nWater bottle on solving Georgia made a lot of money every year we give a far as I did not say for us nothing he's\nNow warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid that was some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know write your face is that the president to hear\nThat Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid won't help\nWhat makes the situation we're we we should be working with these countries to try to ah to help alleviate some of the problems are driving people to come to the United states in the first by\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law

[laughter]\nPeople themselves you know exactly what you're talking about I I I've certainly had my share of corn bread and loved it but hot water or having a sort of what what what what what would I be doing with it if I tried to make this\nHot water corn bread um you start with white corn meal you boil water and the corn meal there is salt and there is a little bit of baking powder\nAnd the hot water actually cooks the corn meal and then you make it into little patties and I always remember my grandmother's fingers being in those patio so she would make a little over one's my mother and makes round ones whatever ... whatever shape and size you want and then you fry it and that\nBut it I mean seriously it sounds like the this recipe really carries a lot of the the larger things that you were learning about yourself through this project\nI must say that this was a personal journey with this book\nI set out to tell this story so that African Americans could appreciate the food more and people outside of the community could understand what it is and and sort of maybe be inspired to\nNot only cook the food but also to look at what their personal ... is and what their food from their culture looks like\nBut I got more from it I think I appreciate other cuisines more I realized I was carrying a chip on my shoulder about my food and wanting it to be special and and having this this moment or not just a moment but to be realized at and\nWhat it is but I had a chip on my shoulder into it come out sideways and ... and you know uh and now it is just a law for this food and a deeper appreciation for other cuisines\nCo high love talking to you thank you for for coming back on the best of luck with the book thank you so much justice in such a pleasure [noise]\nThe book\nIs called the Carla Hall soul food everyday and celebration [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep [noise]\nW.

he's expected to give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era nuclear arms treaty\nThen Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same in two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John ... is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and a former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nThe morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only are the United states and Russia um\nVastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons but we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the wind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons to use just throw it\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia's developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them but they haven't produced them in numbers that really sweating\nIt changed the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority our goal had it under the Obama administration to get Russia\nBack into the treaty because it serves our interests I think the big difference between President Trump the President Obama is President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in\nA is really happy just to pull out\nA and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms to bring them over multiple steps of the government is very happy to go along with you that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security once we do that\n[noise] what do you think John ... is going to say today\n[noise] but I was gonna say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand two um he's going to say this treaty no longer so it was American interests because you cheated on it\nUm and we're going to go or merry way and do whatever you want you guys will just have to play catch up um and I think as we've seen got him a good news more than capable not only playing catch up on a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to this arms race that were already in\nIt and there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place\nAnd then Specter is on the ground in Russia and Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states and it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nI'm from the ministry Chavez office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me but it just goes away um we will be looking at a Russian program that grows or even more than it has and we will be like we have to increase our own spending on in our own

say is the answer to every single problem that's in a sense what you found when the question is education\nI think that's true clearly millennials have has seen his routine when we ask young people any number of questions about the best way to improve public education they always circled back to increase in funding for public education so they want to pay teachers more\nThey want to invest in neighborhood schools and overall they want to give more funding to public education\nAnd one of the features you surveys that you do gleaned data based on the race of the responded in the gender what what did you find it was there a difference depending on who is answering\nIn this case it doesn't seem to matter very much overwhelming a young people I don't want to say independent of race and ethnicity but with their races and ethnicities support this idea of increasing funding for education on any number of dimensions\nSo uh this is a pretty consistent finding that seems to kind of extent across race and ethnicity\nAnd how would you respond and use the money if there were more money for education\nWell they do a number of different things right there is a clear sense and the findings that young people believe that the most effective way to impact public education\nIs to really those kinds of relationships in the classroom that if given a priority with a limited amount of money they want to give it to teachers they want to support teachers they want to strengthen teachers' unions\nWhat about views of if it's not exactly public school I'm Talking about private school but also

American weapons now that includes children as your position on this coalition changed\nIt has changed and certainly changed to before the ... the murder it did Oh yes I you know ... or or intent on pushing back though who these who were trying to take over the country trying to depose a the legitimate government of Yemen a and we're getting Iranian helped to do it\nBut we've seen over the course of time that the Saudis have become increasingly I'm a willing to allow a civilian casualties uh to bomb a more or less indiscriminately oh we shouldn't be ...\nBeing military assistance that enables them to do that\nSo I think a ... certainly of our support for Saudi and the war in Yemen is overdue but I think what the ... murder does also is it tells us we need a broader re examination of our relationship with Saudi Arabia not just a piece of a Yemen but\nIs this really um the country we want to pet her entire Middle East policy on we want to make decisions about ah our support to our relationship was because after a on the basis of so this I I think ought to cause us to do a deep dive examination of\nUs how to conduct a relationship with Saudi Arabia across the board and inappropriately respond\nWell how do you maybe as human rights abuses are not anything new Len and the U.S has remained close ally for years were you concerned when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman

they do and critically and where are their prosecution of the war in Yemen is resulting in more and more civilian ... civilian casualties we can and must a push back a and certainly a not allow our military assistance to to be used to uh hurt innocent people\nAre so they're important ally but they're not one that we want to rely on exclusively for foreign policy in the region\nAnd very briefly there's been partisan disagreement on your committee are you in a position to push any action forward on Saudi Arabia\nI we certainly can push for deep examination of intelligence related to this

very edge of space than it would detach from the rocket and glad to its target\nNow big countries like the U.S China and Russia already have weapons that can do something like this they're called

come from space but people to turn and bank and and the\nFly almost like a real airplane\nAnd that's the real appeal of hyper sonics especially for China and Russia they're afraid the u._s. can shoot down their ballistic missiles with missile defense a hyper sonic weapon can swerve or take a roundabout route to the target will still going incredibly fast it's essentially unstoppable [noise]\nBack

the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a nother election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain that at all or independence from that you you but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned do without an protested free peoples vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWhat they were talking about there is here's with here so they basically said this\nWhen this was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with you you were going to get a lot of money back to working to pay for healthcare none of that to happen and Brexit negotiations or what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely the Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to shift so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back because what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really

United states\nThere are dramatic pictures showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras and these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR but he's not as big an event is news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S and if they're like people in past caravans\nThey'll probably request legal entry but remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all because of this symbolic used being made to these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central American suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelmed by the states he kept a caravan in the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\nWater bottle of Honduras El Salvador varied a lot of money every year we have a far as I say for us nothing he's\nNow warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid that was some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know write your faith rather than through here\nThat's Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid won't help\nMake the situation we're we we should be working with these countries to try to uh to help alleviate some of the problems that are driving people to come to the United states is diverse by\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided amount eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to rich Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief services\nThe history the economics and it's already dark of what we can answer connected sorts very much in the interest of the United states to develop it happened here that violence is reviewed here because it's pushing people in situations of irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressmen angle points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly by if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nKicked off

give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era and nuclear arms treaty then Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles\nBut President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same in two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John ... is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and a former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nGood morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only are the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons\nBut we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the blind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia has developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them\nBut they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatened to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority or goal had been under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests\nI think the big difference between President Trump for President Obama as President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in a is really happy just to pull out a and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreements over multiple ... and the government\nIs very happy to go along and pursue that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security once we do that\nWhat do you think John ... is going to say today [noise] I think John ... going to say you can't cheat on America and get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand two um\nHe's going to say this treating the longer serves America interest because you cheated on it\nUm and we're going to go or a merry way and build whatever missiles we want and you guys will just have to play catch up um and I think as we've seen a lot of ... more than capable not only playing catch up with a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to this arms race that were already in\nIt and there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo new start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place between the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia in Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states\nAnd it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons I'm from the ministry she was in his office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me\nBut if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows or even more than it has a and we will be likely having to increase our own spending and our own nuclear deployments\nDone ... of the nuclear Crisis Group thanks so much\nFor having me\nThis fall's governors' races include won in the largest a swing state
