congressmen won reelection for years so what happened to this fall Democrats trying to help MORNING EDITION\nComing up a California father and daughter in a different generation than radically different politics I'm David Greene in Laguna Beach California and I'm Steve Inskeep\nIn Washington we also you're a critique of the influence of Saudi Arabia and Ronnie ... lives in Silicon valley well from a lot of it\nAnd also this hour Israel raising American was detained in an airport for more\nJust friday October Nineteen Michael Steele the former chairman of the\nI'm a little bit yeah but but you know I also\nGot the sense and and and you probably heard some of this as well but there are a lot of voters who feel the country is so very divided right now and they do feel this shared sense of unease and they want even if there are political divisions to be able to talk to one another again and we heard a lot of people who want to elect people to Congress who are also willing to talk to one another\nOK David thanks for the reporting really appreciate it yeah and we'll go on her\nIn the race for Congress that decision belongs to millions of voters like some of the people that David Was just speaking with hundreds of candidates are on the ballot but much of the attention day to day goes to one single\nPerson that's right and that one person is President Trump who held the latest of his campaign rallies last night he was in Montana firing up\nThe crowd with a joke about violence against a journalist but I had heard that he body slams a reporter [noise] the heat there\nIs the man Trump was stumping for Thursday night GOP house candidate Greg June forte last year he assaulted a reporter he was a candidate at the time who went on to win a special election the following day\nAnd I said oh this is terrible you said it was the elections and I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well I think it might help them [noise]\nIt was convicted of misdemeanor assault\nThat is only one of the ways that journalists are in news stories this morning with the president of the United states as well here with NPR's Scott Horsley Hi there Scott good morning Steve any surprise at all the president would take a verbal shot so to speak at the media\nNo uh you know attacking the news media has been a\nStaple a fixture of Trump rallies for a long time now reporters have been a convenient foil for this president even though Donald Trump ... much of his success\nTo the saturation news coverage he gets from the media uh he acknowledged\nEarly on in the mystery over the disappearance of ... that he was a little bit out of character for him to be expressing concern about the fate of a journalist but you know we've had violent attacks\nOn journalists in this country and that has not stopped the president from using tough language to describe the news media and I don't guess this will either\nWill show gee that would be another way that the president is in the news with a member of the news media because the president himself has drawn his administration have ever closer to Saudi Arabia and of course Saudi Arabia is a close ally of the United states in of any us administration really\nBut the president faces questions about the Saudi role in the disappearance and reporting killing of Jamal ... the dissident journalists who had left to Saudi Arabia was in Turkey went into a shouting console it\nNever is known to have come out how is the president's response evolved if at all over the last several days\nI think he is feeling some pressure to respond if only a ... as treating this as kind of a public relations problem he told the New York times yesterday\nThis one has caught the imagination of the world unfortunately he does seem to recognize that the allegations of this grisly murder at the hands of Saturday operatives has galvanized criticism of the Saudi Arabian government\nIn a way that maybe earlier episodes of the war in Yemen or the mass execution of dissidents has not\nAnd the president has big gun to acknowledge that he and his administration may have to respond to that however reluctantly we saw the first response yesterday with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin announcing that he would pull out of a big investment conference the so called Davos in the desert next week in Riyadh\nHe took that step sort of belatedly a lot of business and journalistic leaders had already pulled out of that conference and it was only announced with a tweet there wasn't a lot of fanfare\nAt the same time you had secretary of state Mike Pompeo just back from visiting Saudi Arabia and turkey are asking for patients and saying you know we ought to give the salaries a few more days to complete their investigation Scott Saudi Arabia\nIs you know is not terribly popular in the United states and here's the president's defending a defendant gets leaders did this feel at all like voting issue in this election season\nIt's not something he's been talking about ... campaign rallies and that's where the president is spending a lot of his time these days he is feeling some pressure from fellow Republicans here in Washington but this doesn't seem like something that's necessarily going to move the needle with the voting public Scott Horsley thanks very much You're welcome\n\nOne more election now Saturday was supposed to be election day in Kandahar Province Afghanistan but now those elections are postpone for a week\nYou know this is after campaign related violence that has left ten candidates in many more supporters did in one case a bomb was planted under a candidates sofa and then yesterday Afghanistan's national police chief was assassinated\nTaliban insurgents who want to disrupt the election have claimed responsibility but rival politicians are also suspected to be behind some of this violence\nLet's turn now to Pamela constable who has covered Afghanistan for years and she's on the line welcome back\nWith you I Want to understand where these elections stand some of them have been postponed is that right\nAt this point they're going to be held in most of the country although it cars can crack\nA number of polls are already going to be close so it's not a nation wide election already but they're closing a delaying the polling at all throughout the cod are we in our province\nOf by one wake up at greatly to have it to the to the number of a fight that that will not voting for now what\nDo parliamentary elections looked like in two thousand Eighteen in Afghanistan are people able to get out and campaign and hold rallies or is that not even safe\nCare I mean ... and ... and the one that is very exciting because they've got an enormous enormous scale the candidate you know walking two thousand five hundred candidates ah I'm I'm all in the center for I it is a way to\nDraft a mixture of you know ... the elder got young women and stylish clothing and you've got\nAll sorts of you know young educated ... men where it's very short or no beard glasses pies and then you have a unusual phenomenon a former warlord\nAh nothing like their fathers look very modern and claim to cut back I have on their big campaign car fares satellite photos that there are there\nAre less less elders we could put it that way so that was it\nThat are positive on that fence the negative of course is that there has been actually cried a great deal of violence\nJust in a few seconds does it feel like however these elections turnout the will of the people might actually be expressed in some legitimate way\n\nI think so I guess I felt there are allegations of fraud that allegations of pre election tampering voter ID card a last minute ethic fat by introducing biometric technology but it remains to be seen whether in fact this will be a reasonably successful and fair election\nWell we'll we'll listen for the results whenever they get around to completing the elections have been

C. Saudi Arabia suspected role in the disappearance of a journalist has thrown a shadow over Saudi money\nAmerican businesses have enjoyed Saturday investments for years only now are executives facing real questions about Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy it's brutal war in Yemen and above all about the reported murder of journalist ... ...\nMuch Saudi money has gone to Silicon Valley and do some tax CEOs have backed out of a forthcoming Saudi investment conference the investments themselves remain writer ... has just been talking with audiences this week in Silicon valley and he's been telling them the Saudi money is tainted\nIn recent years the Saudi sovereign wealth fund has become one of the biggest swinging checkbooks in Silicon valley through a kind of open secret of a front\nWhich has softbank a big Japanese fund that launched a hundred billion dollar vision fund forty five billion dollars of that first hundred billion dollar fund with the Saudi Government money and recently they announced the second vision fun\nSo Saudi Arabia if you have a start up and big dreams of changing the world making it a better place empowering women and others [noise]\nA lot of those people with a lot of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saturday investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is you just use huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying God I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIt's varying but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in over with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with\nThe un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that ... heads people and that might well have murdered ... and the consulate ... that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff ... and others he got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got some credibility columnists to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op [noise] but do you have any evidence that when the Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spend time out there is that just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the fall city of those pretensions to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth that is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley and I want to be clear this financial investment\nNot the only thing that's happened you know as many of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference then you've got this new five hundred billion dollar mega city that the Saudis are creating called Neal\nAnd Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people other corporate people on the board and so these folks in Silicon valley and make a lot of a very important decisions about what kind of world we live in\nIf these people are basically no better\nThan chemical magnates who'd dumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand\nWhat was it like in the last several days as you were traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place that relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain that America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and that things need to change but in the private conversations Steve I Will tell you deep\nIn the bowels of these institutions\nThere is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the

will you might say Huntington Beach is part of the resistance to that resistance it's a conservative city that won a lawsuit against the state government over its so called sanctuary law\nCalifornia lawmakers don't want local police departments cooperating with federal immigration authorities to target people here illegally Huntington Beach argued we can cooperate with them if we want to a city

like Pablo and your other friends who are in the country illegally\nAnd also support President Trump who is so\nTough on people who are in the country illegally like how can you\nHow ... how can I put

Saudi Arabia suspected role in the disappearance of a journalist is thrown a shadow over Saudi money\nAmerican businesses have enjoyed Saturday investments for years only now are executives facing real questions about Saudi Arabia is absolute monarchy it's brutal war\nIn Yemen and above all about the reported murder of journalist ... ...\nMuch Saudi money has gone to Silicon Valley and do some tech CEOs have backed out of a forthcoming Saudi investment conference the investments themselves remain writer ... has just been talking with audiences this week in Silicon valley and he's been telling them the Saudi money is tainted\nIn recent years this Saturday sovereign wealth fund has become one of the biggest swinging checkbooks\nIn Silicon valley through a kind of open secret of a front which is soft bank a big Japanese fund that launched a hundred billion dollar vision fund forty five billion dollars of that first hundred billion dollar fund with the Saudi Government money and recently they announced the second vision fun\nSo Saudi Arabia if you have a start up\nAnd big dreams of changing the world and making it a better place empowering women and others [noise]\nA lot of those people with a lot of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saturday investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is you just use huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying God I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIt's varying but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in over with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with\nThe un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that bad people and that might well have murdered ... in the ... ... that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff ... and others he got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got some jealous columnists to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op but do you have any evidence that when the Saudis invest\nSo in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spend time out there is I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the false city of those pretensions to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth\nThat is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley and I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as many of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference\nThen you've got this new five hundred billion dollar mega city that the Saudis are creating called Neal\nAnd Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people other corporate people on the board and so these folks in Silicon valley and make a lot of very important decisions about what kind of world we live in\nIf these people are basically no better\nThan chemical magnates who'd dumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand\nWhat was it like in the last several days as you were traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place the relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain that America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and that things need to change but in the private conversation Steve I Will tell you deep\nIn the bowels of these institutions\nThere is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the valley frankly have a much more sophisticated understanding of power the very power they wheeled in the privileged they wield\nThat some of the people who founded these companies have been
