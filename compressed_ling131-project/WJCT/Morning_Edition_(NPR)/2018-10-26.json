NPR's medical months and our thanks to mimic oh You're welcome art which I Want to get your thoughts on what to medical was saying because you have been in Texas for the last week talking to voters\nRight let's talk about Texas I Am currently in Del Rio which is\nJust next to lake ... on the Rio Grande river which separates the U.S and Mexico and this is the last stop on a week long road trip that we've done through the twenty third congressional district here in Texas this is one of the state's only true swing districts\nTotally fascinating place now well that sounds about a third of the entire U.S Mexico border\nOkay so this is a massive district and I wonder as you've been knocking doors talking to people does any of what to medical was just saying line up with what you've been hearing from people particularly from women\nRight so he mentioned the power women so we want to talk to some especially in the suburbs around San Antonio suburban women are really going to be influential in these midterms we met a woman named Janet Ogle for ah she like a lot of white liberal women in this country said that Donald Trump's election\nJust devastated our uh and really caused her to become politically active in a completely new way now she registers people to vote she volunteered for democratic candidates I'm and she is committed in a way she never was before let's listen to a little bit\nWish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't\nThink it was so necessary now I Do ...\nSo at the same time or I should know we also talked with one of Janet's neighbors a Republican who really likes what President Trump is doing in fact she was going to speak with us a on Monday we had this all scheduled and she had to reschedule so that she could road trip to Houston with her friends to see Donald Trump do his thing at a Houston rally\n[laughter] All right and I know that while you've been down there you also been looking at particular economic factors in these places and you you visited a place that's experiencing something like an oil boom\nSomething I mean totally boom I'm this is a place called ... Texas\nIt's really benefited from uh all the fracking that's been happening in oil country I'm just to give you a sense of how the place has grown in twenty tend the population was around eight thousand people today city officials don't even know what the real popular while they speculate\nThat because of all the temporary oil workers who are there are there could be up to fifty thousand people living there at any given time uh which has put a massive strain on the town because it ... it all happened so quickly they haven't been able to really keep up there's not enough food on the grocery store shelves they don't have enough restaurants\nBut what's really interesting is how it seems to be changing the politics of the place most of the population is Hispanic traditionally they've been Democrats\nBased on our conversation there that could actually be shifting a because these all these new people are coming in with new viewpoints people who gives the party in power credit for the current economic boom I Want to play a clip from a conversation we had with a guy named John pack\nOf a double bus our ...\nOf struggle for a long time and have come out here and I'm I'm not struggling more like I was\nJust feel like it's going to dry up anytime soon\nAlong Trump so\nYou're feeling good Robin dropped right\nHe's run the Trump trainer and trains pretty happy about the economy a credit to the president clearly a lot of people here feel that way\nAnd of course immigration a huge issue where you are\nRight but you would think so anyway we're actually at a part of the border that's pretty quiet we're just a few miles from a coon yeah Mexico\nThese two communities Del Rio and a ... totally entwined like is the case and a lot of border cities we met people who cross the border on a daily basis to go to the dentist I buy the groceries\nUm they don't see it as a crisis here uh and opinions about President Trump and his immigration policies are pretty much split in a partisan way what people here do agree on and we're talking about Democrats we spoke with an Republicans\nIs that a wall the idea of building a border wall is not going to fix the country's broken immigration system\n... the last question Democrats have been looking for years to turn Texas blue I think it's going to happen\nRight so we've heard a lot about the so called blue wave on the congressional side the incumbent Republican will hurt has an advantage to recent poll says he's up Fifteen points against his Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones on the side of the Democrat Beto O'Rourke has given Ted Cruz for his money recent polling has him down five points against cruise\nA Ted Cruz is fighting for every vote though he is going to be here in Del Rio next week something people here say hasn't happened for a long long time\nRachel Martin in Del Rio Texas thanks very reporting Rachel you about [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nDavos in the desert opens under a cloud on a secret trip to turkey the director of the CIA here's the worst elsewhere who's listening in on President Trump's Unstuck Your cell phone and the Titanic will fail again with a lot more lifeboats\nThe friday news round up next time on one week days at eleven on eighty nine nine W.

over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of role and with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobs says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition\nThat's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point\nFor example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant but one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op\nMike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland

six on eighty nine nine W Jaycee to your community your world you\nPipe bombs incendiary rhetoric and political targets converge as the midterms get closer I'm Joshua Johnson plenty to get to on the friday news round up much time on one day It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Noel King we're going to take a look now at a disturbing and confounding case of sexual assault more than a hundred and fifty women and girls came forward in court this year and said they were sexually abused by one man and that abuse went on for decades\nLarry Nassar most of the top doctor for the U.S women's Olympic gymnastics team he also worked from Michigan State university this past January Nassar was sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison today we're going to look at a really what is the central mystery has the case how did Nasser get away with it for so long\nTo reporters at Michigan Radio have been digging into this question and a new podcast that's called believed I talked to the host Kate Wells and Lindsey Smith and before we start we should warn listeners this conversation includes some graphic language describing sexual assault\n... both high while for having us I Know that um when you guys set out one of your goals was to dig more deeply into the failures that allowed mass are to abuse women and girls for as long as he did what did you find\nThis is Kate so one of the things that we found is that guys like Larry Nassar are are really good at winning your trust and you can hear some of that actually happening in a police tape\nHere was tape during two different police interviews there two years apart for both two different complaints by the Michigan State university police\nAnd in the first one you can hear him talking to this detective about this complaint that's coming against him\nTo lose to everybody's surprise or the same time ... would feel that I was doing something in a full day here you know it's\nGoing to be here and that you feel bad that she feels that way because I feel like this little more really that far right and that's why there's something wrong John Ritter spread like wildfire across the right one of these seventh year what\nI mean this is fascinating she is being interrogated by a police officer who's telling him it's good to hear that you feel bad what does that tell you\nWell I mean what really that shows you how good Larry Nassar is at manipulating other people and and how overwhelming on an individual level\nThat can feel you know what is more likely in this situation that one young woman as far as this detective is aware as miss understood a valid medical technique\nOr you know this Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level\nTo not get sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways of it is two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and\nI teach this I lecture on this any sort of doubt you might have had about his technique than his legitimacy he's really doing everything he can to build that up this is Kate again\nHe gets cleared to go back to work after that they put him back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah\nEventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape of that but tell me about it as well so this is an interrogation from twenty\nA another accuser has come forward that same her name is Rachel ... comes forward publicly in a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police it's detective Andrea unfettered and she definitely takes a different approach\nThat she is working ... to go\nSee that that was eventually will never do that for the taxes or would you like voters I'm using this as I've penetrating this attitude is pushing off her\n[noise] okay um this\nWas something that what you're describing is very different than how she described that are strands\nWhat is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to an arrest where the other one did not\nI mean to put it probably to simply does that give them an Fred comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint\nAnd Rachel has brought a lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records and so ... believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on\nMasks are it's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused it's very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple questions and you start to hear that he can't he just starts to fall apart\nThere was a arousal with is is very much because of over ... ... well\nSometimes you get interaction I mean but I don't actually if you are but you know you just say that you know you you you um [noise]\nAnd when we interviewed this detective Andrea ... when she talks about looking back at the interviews that she herself\nWas kind of I'm sure why NASA our we have so much trouble answering such a simple questions like why would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way and that pertains to answer and then I thought\nThat was his answer he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation so you guys in you're digging you learned that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start by believing the victim worth the very least hearing the victim out yeah\nWell I mean fundamentally this is how guys like this operate as they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and who seems like just this great guy\nCould be hurting somebody as humans who are not good at thinking that can happen to the people that we work with or who are family\nBut the reality is that guys like Larry Nassar don't operate in a vacuum it it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and to fail these women and girls for so long\nKate Wells and Lindsey Smith are hosts of the new podcast

twenty third congressional district which is where we find our own Rachel Martin today get rid of it going\nAnd going pretty good I Am in Del Rio Texas looking out over lake ... which is actually part of the natural barrier that separates the U.S from Mexico at least in this part of the border\nBut this is a huge congressional district just in terms of geography at stretches all the way from outside of El Paso to San Antonio but what is in the middle of this district is also a very interesting at this moment fracking has turned the once a small city of pick is Texas into a boom town\nThis is the practice [noise]\nThere's a there's a lot of things that are happening all at once or the voice you hear is that a thirty year old ... like a lot of people born and raised here and take notice\nWe call it the refreshing [noise] they'll go down all the photos well many people making money off the oil industry here got a wife and three kids and not a lot of tolerance for\nYou'll hear people say that the oil industry\nAnd it really can be because\nPeople aren't careful they get so dependent on it when it's gone\nThey don't know what and I didn't want that to be\nSo we started a business that rents out construction equipment like port a potties to all sorts of corporations including oil companies and when it comes to politics not Elliott doesn't give President Trump all the credit for this bill but he does like what he's been seen\nAmerica First taking pride in what we do um you know letting people know that [noise] you know we're not in you know we're just about we're not going to be somebody's little hand out all the time and\nThat you know we want to grow our economy here\nAnd ask for pick us specifically as long as a kitten before doesn't make\nThe biggest hasn't just been moving forward it has been barreling down the highway at breakneck speed with no roads [noise]\nIt's really an emergency situation we weren't prepared for this this is\nThe mayor ... name has been ... seals and she says her city needs to see more of that money because now there are way more people here in this place can handle what's the population of\nThat's a hard one to answer according to the twenty teen population were just under ten thousand we are easily on any given day somewhere between thirty and fifty thousand depending on how many people are driving it\nAnd that's putting a huge strain on this small towns infrastructure there aren't enough things like restaurants or even grocery stores\nUnless you've actually been here you don't understand what the natives here\nYou don't understand what it's like to stand in these lines at the grocery store and then when you go\nThe shows the route of bread milk you know all the staples\nMy husband's retired he knows when ... guys you know [laughter] when the British guy shows up literally that's when he goes to get those things for us that's crazy it is crazy we would probably have exploded even more if we had the housing in place\nBecause right now so many of these workers that are living in the arby's travel trailers the workforce lodging\nThey'll live there but most time their families aren't going to live there for an indefinite length of time\nThis is oil field you don't want to bring your family here anyways demand cameras\nYet um it had ... that is one literally what people here call the temporary housing sites that have popped up in the last few years to accommodate all of these oil workers Kaylee Duke is the twenty four year old manager of this man camp she's wearing a rainbow tight I T shirt with a unicorn on it it says keeping it real they work\nThese crazy hours so we just have to get in there and make it like home like home cooked meals smile on your face you know agreed on like kind of that thing so it's not like it's their princesses but uh it's nice to come to remain bed\nKaylee points out the double wide trailers as we walk around each of them can sleep up to ten men sometimes they get their own room sometimes if they work opposite shifts they share\nWe got our two full size beds and we have a night table into a closet like [noise] um what\n... years ago Kelly was doing the same work in North Dakota and when the oil and pick us took off so did she\nIt's good money and let's say you're not going to college at the moment I mean this is the place to be if you're out in the Sacramento\nSo that's a snapshot of the situation here and take us fracking has opened up the basins and there's money to be made by anyone who can find a foothold into oil or any of the related businesses\nNot everyone is seeing a direct benefit though property taxes have gone up here the problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike it's working class families who have been here for generations\nThe mentality is take it while you\nCan but they don't recognize it there are people who are being left behind\nAll the ... is the county attorney she's a lifelong Democrat as are most people here but the oil boom seems to be changing\nHere we are [noise]\nAll the has been going door to door\nHow are you sir [noise]\nTrying to get their bowed out for Beto O'Rourke [noise] okay thanks bye-bye\nBeto O'Rourke has given Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money and all the never expected that ... would have an uphill battle here\nPeople I knew um who had been Democrat three years having now just\nDecided that I guess the Republican ways better\nBecause even if they themselves are making money hand over fist people around them are and that has to be good in the long run so the thinking goes maybe they'll finally get that grocery store there's also talk of any hospital maybe the city will have enough money to fix up the rundown cemetery in the middle of town\nSo what happened to the blue wave I mean the reason but our work has gotten so much that's where the attention is because he's come further than any other democratic candidate in recent history a but you're not feeling it I'm not feeling it here [noise]\nWere filling up our DNC you pause at the gas station on the main drag a bearded guy in an equally large truck drove up and started chatting his name is John pack\nI retired from the fire department\nFor three years go by her work\nOf a double ...\nOf struggled for a long time and have come out here and I'm I'm not struggling more like a worse\nThat feel like it's going to dry up and you\nBecause right now we're moving forward\nQuick fast and in a hurry people like the feeling of the momentum here no well and the impact of the oil boom as you heard the shifting politics and pick us but like we said this was a really big congressional district it is truly one of the state's only swing districts and we export to other fascinating corners of it this week oh it was great\nTo hear those voices and you can hear more stories from rituals reporting in those other corners of the twenty third Texas

C. and I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we have been on a road trip through the Texas twenty third congressional district district which is actually a rare swing district in this very red state it covers a long stretch of\nLand that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio\nAnd we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the mid term elections immigration has become a huge issue leading into these midterms across the country President Trump has seized on to the issue during rallies I had a voting day including the rally that he held here in Houston earlier in the week\nBut we wanted to know how the immigration issue is playing here along the border right now at this very moment I'm looking out over the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nIt's lake ... on the Rio Grande river ... means friendship in Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side in Mexico and they'll real case it's the city of ... junior Mexico\nWe're family and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations\nAnd our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah I don't look down to them and they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I Want them to come here but I Want them to come here the right way a mental lives with her longtime partner Ralph ... also\nGrew up here like if you're going to get some tea or ... I really want to have you know how to move or highly you can also demand across into a ... a couple of times a week what to say that\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there my groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight it can get it because I get on my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think\nIt makes me very angry what do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\n... ... ... when they say separate ... there is a while I don't think anybody back and you went to you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nIt's it's it's ... it's a rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions people are prepared for that\nWe've had those instances where you know people have died out there\nWhen the last six months up that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's linked up before anybody starts talking about the border wall\nAnd need to see it in this natural state\nThink that there's a war zone out here and it's actually not\nTo me before we start throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez Dr sets up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes he knows the owner he tells us it's no problem there perks sheriff\nSettle deserves message will\nJust across this little yeah that's even a river this looks like an\nEarthquake or encourage the Rio Grande river how many feet are we talking\nAbout ah we're probably talking what three hundred feet foreigner feet [noise]\nI mean that's the hardest from across\nSo nine someone can just swim across just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm\nAsked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even a Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support people like chef Martinez\nWill ever come to an air of giving them the same tour\nLike well he's he's self that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration\nThe shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nOr we were holding everybody else was even the bones were eaten bologna\nAnd I think that to solve the immigration issue the sure has to be at the table you can't you can't just go to though\nBecause he knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that wall\nSay my idea was to\nYou can control with technology cameras a set of putting the\nPhysical structure because you're going to put it\nOn Monday PBS NewsHour is going to Eris special broadcast it's called the battleground Florida examining key races in Florida hates candidates handed drafted intend to major theme among voters nationwide\nWatch PBS NewsHour on Monday it's called battleground Florida seven pm on W.

Dan Mendelson of health care consulting firm apple Lear\nBasically what they would do is create a benchmark of prices based on\nWhat drug companies are charging internationally empowering\nMedicare to get those lower prices this is something Republicans have resisted in the past but Northwestern University health care economists Craig Garth weight calls at the same Trump in world view behind recent tariffs\nWhere the world is that other people are taking advantage of the United states and we're going to be strong and we're going to fix that\nAnd so we're going to force Europe to pay more by\nHaving the United states pay less\nHe says European prices would go up a little with drug companies knowing there simultaneously setting us prices now there's a lot of unknowns here how it would

ideas boost the economy or fix the environment\nThat used to seem crazy to many other economists who tend to focus more on concrete things which is which is coming out of factories not seemingly mushy things like ideas Dr Paul Romer chews on all sorts of interesting matters such as the difference between blind optimism I things will be fine you'll magically have enough money for retiring\nVersus what is called conditional optimism retirement will be fine if we have a savings plan\nRobbers and economists to New York university's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of two winners of the Nobel Prize in economics ... welcome to the program\nGlad to be here I mean since you won the prize the other day has been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses be patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nIf you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization and the way this was gonna destroy jobs\nThe complacent attitude would have been to say ah it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine that's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was the sense of we've got to do the right thing and the twentieth century there was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the level of high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment education everything turned out better for everybody but if you just are complacent say up it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also due to\nThe labor force with artificial intelligence automation robots are entering everyone says highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who say don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism\nHelp us with what tech will do to the workforce at this time around\nAbsolutely and and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know the twenty century turned out fine so there is no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's no basis for complacency in the success record that we can see when we look back\nThere are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and in thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turned out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably think of a pretty good sense of how politicians tick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights an economics is this idea of a division of labor\nAnd do the things you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody so there's a process that involves a kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or any other politician builds coalitions they try to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and here's some things that you could try but\n... you are the ones who make the decision\nAnd before we go duck to remember

correspondent Greg Myre and Greg thanks so much thank you oh\nAnd now we turn to\nThe term elections leading up to next month's voting we've been bringing you stories from some of the key districts across the country Texas' twenty third district is viewed as one of the Lone Star state's only real truth swing districts and that's where we find our own Rachel Martin Morning Rachel\nHey no algal morning from Del Rio Texas that's where we're broadcasting from this morning right near the U.S border with Mexico this district is huge not in terms of population necessarily but in terms of just actual en masse it goes all the way from just outside El Paso to San Antonio\nAnd the suburbs around those cities are really key in the upcoming elections Republicans and Democrats are both fighting for the votes in particular of white suburban women like the two women were going to introduce you to right now\nWe driven the hunters creek neighborhood and quickly noticed a pattern we passed hunter circles entrance gate hunters do\nEvery street starts with hunters yes it's kind of silly right it just makes it that much more confusing because\nThis is Janet Ogle store she and her husband made a good living in real estate they are retired now and she teaches part time ... at the gym nearby and so that makes it more cardio okay the little sweaty and\nHave you taken ... we met her at her house in a well manicured cul de sac\nGet it says people here are friendly enough but on the whole everyone sort of keep to themselves which actually suits are just fine she filled up water bottles and we headed out for a walk was on straight yeah actually for this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women\nWhen Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart and to get\nTogether I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood\nAnd I actually got a pink Cape my first year\n'cause like put in more hours and then people can be about as much as you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even let's campaign staffers stay in our house so is it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor you know I've always been aware of politically but I've also been complacent\nI mean look around wearing this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much um and I hate that about\nWish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't\nThink it was so necessary and now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the ... are painted to look like pumpkin for Halloween\nSo if you like we can cut right through here to my house yeah let's do it okay there are a lot of campaign signs in Janet's front yard all for Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race against Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz\nJanet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an Internet scene battle on the Web site next door\nIt all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign\nThen he and others on the site talked about reading their signs with the power record to electric you the next person who tried Janet read the comments off the thread\nHere's what I wouldn't want to kill them but I Would share the video of him being shocked until the break or kicked good for you it's just goes on\nFor her crew supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters and she just can't understand where they're coming from\nI think Trump spaces last I think when I hear them described as a cult that makes sense to me from what I've\nHeard and seen that whatever he says is find\nWhoever he hurts assigned\nDennis neighbor Ellen Pfeifer is a big fan of Donald Trump\nHi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely I'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally and Ellen had to go she and a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how was it\nIt was great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be and more\nEllen likes the direction that the country is moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration\nThe obvious uh onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries that are coming from and coming through two songs to flow a\nIt's very concerning and ah there's just no accounting for all these people\nFlowing in I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet ... in particular the bit were Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult Ellen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as open minded\nI blog walked with a liver over in a very liberal neighborhood all summer and the because I thought she was the best person for the job so I don't know I don't think I'm part of that cold\n[noise] um I guess I Would close by just asking if you could change anything about our current political moment would what would you change ah [noise]\nI I think I'm Out there every day you know I'm trying to uh to be the opposite\nOf a cold and and have open arms to people and\nUh I I you know I Hope that I can lead by example and I think I Do uh we might have\nPolitical differences that we all or you know working towards the same goal\nBut Noel that sentiment that you heard Ellen expressing there really is aspirational she she totally feels that divides between parties right now so does her neighbor Janet as we heard they're each making their case to their neighbors to try to see the world as they see it\nAnd these voters are going to be making decisions into really big races how are they talking about the Senate contest between Beto O'Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz and about the congressional race\nRight so we should say the congressional race a pitch the incumbent Republican will heard against the Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones and according to a recent poll by the New York times will hurt is up in that race by Fifteen points so that's a really big spread you know he's got an advantage not only is he the incumbent but he's\nReally positioned himself as as a moderate in in a swing district which he has to do\nA and and that is working to his advantage over work crews much closer a cruise is up by seven points Beto O'Rourke is making a play\nOr will be if all the miles he's put on his car all the face time he's putting with voters will make a difference um but it would be it would be\nTo tonic shift in Texas

from the U.S border with Mexico I'm at this very moment looking over lake on his side on the Rio Grande river this is the natural divide between the U.S and Mexico\nDel Rio is part of the twenty third congressional district in Texas a really one of the only swing districts in this red state and we've been here talking to voters about what's on their mind to head of the twenty eighth team the terms and how they measure the presidency of Donald Trump\nThere's a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour embarrassed that addresses that very topic and we have NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro with us to discuss the findings concerning the medical Hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas sky and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in politics\nBut so that's\nReally nice um but let's dig into the\nPoll findings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last\n[noise] not really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that's more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there's a natural rise\nA and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he's motivating their vote has gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent\nWe see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as opposed to the he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty Eighteen is about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet ... in the suburbs of San Antonio same thing uh she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she has become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does the poll addressed what are the\nIssues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out this year\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election President Trump to third said that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs and the economy followed by health care and immigration\nOf which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close\nFor Democrats it's health care and climate change a notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to

C. and I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we have been on a road trip through the Texas twenty third congressional district which is a rare swing district in this very red state\nAnd it covers a long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the midterms\nPresident Trump has made immigration a central issue in the upcoming vote warning about the influx of migrants from Central America were coming through Mexico towards the U. S. the president hammer at this point again during a rally in Houston earlier this week\nBut we wanted to know how the issue is playing here along the border which is where we are right now I'm looking out over lake ... which connects to the Rio Grande river\nThat river is the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico army started means friendship and Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side a coon yeah Mexico\nWe're a family and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah\nI don't look down to them and they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I Want them to come here but I Want them to come here the right way\nAmanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph also grew\nUp here you know like if you're

shopping over there I go to the dentist over there my groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S [noise] but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight to keep coming maybe you can always get my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from\nPresident Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\n... and ... when they say separate a while there is a while to get on with anybody back and if you went to you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nIt's it's ... rugged\nTerrain this is Joe Frank Martinez he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions people are prepared for that\nWe've had those instances where you know people have died out there\nWhen the last six months of that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico that's learned\nBefore anybody storage talking about the border wall\nThe new to see it in this natural state\nKorea is a war zone on her and it's actually not\nTo me before we started throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses alone the riverbank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes he knows the owner he tells us with no problem there ... sheriff\nThat'll do further as much as\nJust across this little yeah even a river this looks like a\nLink to encourage the river and remember how many feet are we talking\nAbout ah we're probably talking what three hundred feet foreigner feet [noise]\nI mean that's the hard to swim across\nSo nine someone can just swim across just walk up here just like we did and walk to that road ...\nAsked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities and even a Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones\nWas trying to tie her to President Trump but this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support the people like sure Martinez\nWill it come to an air of giving them the same tour\nAlert Wilders to filter office has been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric protein is is pleased about one thing\nThis administration\nThe shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nOr we were older but it'll leaving the bones were blown\nThat up but the to solve the immigration issue the sure have read the paper\nWe tend to tend to just go to\nBecause he knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that
