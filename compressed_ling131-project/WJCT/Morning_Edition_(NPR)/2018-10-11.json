Ricky and\nNaturally vacation like the ... vote happy fifty Islamist\nYou know one reason people were surprises because economic growth has been strong unemployment is at a record low so the question is what spooked investors here President Trump is blaming the Federal Reserve which set interest rates for the sell off I think\nBut whatever whomever you blame the Dow drop has markets in Asia and Europe ... this morning as well\nAll right we've got NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner with us this morning ... what's going on why the drop\nGood morning well there there are a lot of things that are going on right now um\nOne is that you know we've had a decidedly sour mood take over the market in the last few days yes and the five hundred is following five straight days it got a lot worse yet they've got a lot worse yesterday and on the NASDAQ where a lot of the tech stocks are traded it was even more so it was down more than four percent\nAnd a lot of say isn't really that surprising because\nThe big technology companies they've lived this long rally they really power to you know the the names you know Facebook Amazon apple Netflix or Google alphabet which is ... ... they've led this rally um but since the beginning of the month they start\nFall off some of those stocks are really struggling now\nSo President Trump is blaming the fed of presumably because they raise interest rates can you explain the connection here\nRight well so the fed has raised interest rates eight times in the last three years it started from a very low base\nRates were basically zero for a long time so it's steadily started to to raise rates as the economy improved as a recovered with the intention of keeping inflation in check ins recovery and keeping the economy on an even keel\nUm but that rising interest rates makes borrowing costs more expensive for companies for people and it can have the effect of ... of somewhat slowing the recovery\nUm and the president as we heard in there say that he thinks the fed has gone crazy in the Clinton clearly disagrees he wants the fed to prop up the economy by keeping interest rates low explain why that's not necessarily a great idea [noise] well I mean it's not\nUncommon for for presidents to complain about the fed or to be unhappy with the fed when they raise rates especially if it's any time at close to an election what is unusual for president to say the fed has gone crazy\nUm that's really unusual or you know if the fed has a policy where is trying to keep this recovery going it's trying to keep inflation so I get once a steady economy\nUm if you keep ... rates very low there's the potential the economy could overheat and fall back into recession\nRight and of course we know President Trump talks a lot about the stock market as an indicator of whether or not the overall economy is healthy and it is it isn't necessarily the best indicator but as you mention the elections coming up so it matters to him a lot I'm\nSure does I mean he's talked throughout his administration and how about how great the economy has been or how great the stock market has been he's taken a lot of credit for that now if the stock market does go into a downturn it will be interesting to see how it explains that and what more do you think's Costas asked that\nNPR senior business editor Uri Berliner for I think sorry thanks\n[noise]\nAll right we're learning more this morning about what might have happened to the missing Saudi journalist Jamal ... he went inside the Saudi conflict and assembled assembled turkey last week and he has not been seen since\nAnd here's one new thing we have learned the Washington Post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered agents to learn because she'll be back to Saudi Arabia from his home in the United states Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said yesterday that if if the Saudi Government was behind 'cause she'll get disappearance that would be quote a game changer\nI've never been more disturbing them right now\nIf this didn't happen at this man was murdered in Saudi conflict stumble across every line of\nNormality or in the international community\nUm if it did happen it would be hell to pay\nThe Saudi officials are continuing to deny any involvement in showbiz disappearance\nAll right we have reached Korean so he he is the Washington Post correspondent in its ... who's been following this story closely Corinne can you just explain what exactly you have learned that U.S intelligence officials new\nHigh yeah thanks for having me as my colleague Shane Harris reported today in our paper\nThe the U.S officials\nAre citing intelligence intercepted Saudi officials discussing this plot to lure them out\nBack to Saudi Arabia we don't know for what purpose exactly um the er and you know Jamal and told friends over the last year about\nAttempts either Saudi officials are people close to the Saudi Government confirming some version of this story that he was offered jobs um or or or a short that he would be safe as he returns to the kingdom\nSo we're still learning more about this but it it adds detail to what we might know about what happened in the consulate hearing this stumble\nBecause we should just say he has been a vocal critic of ... of the Saudi Government and had been living in a in the Washington DC area I mean do we know is the U.S intelligence officials gave him a heads up that they knew that that someone in Saudi was trying to get him back there perhaps to do harm to him\nNo we don't we know that um the details of this plot appear to have been widely circulated around the intelligence community but we we have no evidence yet that he was warned about this plots and there's some debate about whether there was an obligation to tell them\nSo you are reporting you and your colleagues are reporting that basically what what seems to have happened in the sample hit that the parents there a test how the conflict in temple may have been plan B if they couldn't lure him back from the U.S to Saudi this what ... ... a disappearance and assemble may have may have been a subsequent plan\nThat that's certainly one theory I mean the Turkish officials since the beginning of this case to maintain that what happened inside look to them like a premeditated killing\n'em but others are saying now that some some of the details from these intelligence inserts out I'm a make it seem like make it seem possible that it also may have\nBeen an attempt to capture him and bring him back to Saudi Arabia\nI mean it's clearly complicated for the Trump Administration which has very close ties to Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin some on the crown prince known as NBS I mean in particular you report he's got a really close relationship with Jared Kushner\nAbsolutely the um\nThe uh the Trump Administration has had very close ties with a mom and been some man and they really promoted his vision hum of a transformation for the kingdom\nAnd so\nThis whole episode has highlighted or the other part of mom and been some man's rule which has been um in a escalating repression dissidents hum and silencing descent\nSo we'll see if the Trump Administration if someone is is it seemed to be responsible for this plot if the Trump Administration would put sanctions on Saudi Arabia [noise] um we still appreciate you sharing your reporting Corinne by some of the Washington Post based in as temple thank you so much thanks for having me\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News\nThe

American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans and Mexican fought back\nAnd poked says look there's been this terrible attack on us by Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly gave it\nTo I guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between the U.S and Mexico right\nHe did and the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress than say we need a big war with Mexico but wait\nA minute here he's still like to ask Congress Congress still had to act how did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was essentially taking their authority away\nMany senators or that poker is trying to treat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this were overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why aren't we fighting back would be very hard for them\nSay no and that was a pattern that lasted in the future okay but still at that time in history Congress was declaring war the president would ask Congress would do it if we go ahead a century\nTo around Nineteen fifty Harry Truman is the president the United states what happened to Nineteen fifty\n[noise] I Love ... but he did this terrible thing in Nineteen fifty the north Koreans attacked the south in June of Nineteen fifty and went trolling should have done under the constitution he should have gone to Congress and said I had like a war declaration they would have given up to him but Truman was terrified that there'd be a big debate\nWhere he might be criticized that might undermine him in the mid term elections of Nineteen fifty\nSo trauma didn't even bother going to Congress he said I'm doing this as a police action under the United nations I don't need\nA declaration and the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four when he wanted his war in Vietnam said Truman didn't ask Congress I don't have to do it either and we've never had a declaration of war sense not since Nineteen forty two and that is totally in violation of\nThe constitution what are some of the consequences of this evolution increase really in presidential power when we look at the last I don't know twenty Thirty years\nThe result is a modern president nowadays can start a war almost singlehandedly and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United states in World War that is popular your poll ratings were arrives\nYou write early in this book\nWhere the founders to come back they would probably be astonished and chagrined discovered that in spite of their Arden striving Z the life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of the single person who happens to be president of the United states\nThe founders knew but almost anyone could become president and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happens to\nGet that job when you wrote that line recently did you have any particular individual in mind\nPresident Trump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons in two thousand eleven he tweeted\nPresident Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get reelected president he predicted that President Obama would do that but I didn't know about it he makes the connection between war and politics of the founders never wanted to see a president make\nThe other thing is that like other presidents President Trump is more remarked on the fact that [noise] often times if you want to be considered a great president it's easier to do that if you've been commander in chief during war that has a thought that our founders would never wanted to hear from any president\nOne of the recent episode I Want to ask about President Obama and two thousand Thirteen seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria because of Syria's use of chemical weapons\nI'm ready to act in the face of this average\nToday I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world\nThat we are ready to move forward together\nAs one nation and specifically said I'm not going to do that without the approval of Congress it's seen as a serious mistake and foreign policy had left to push our laws out of Syria with much more freedom would you argue that it was the right choice even though it seems to have been a mistake\nI think it is always the right choice for president never to get into a war unless he's got Congress in with him on the take off he belatedly saw that that was not going to be possible and that's why he pulled back\nMichael Beschloss is the author of presidents of war the epic story from

Trump's legislative agenda the GOP ability to put conservative judges on the court but the political stakes are particularly high for the party currently out of power and cares national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nAsked veteran democratic strategist Paul the gala what's at stake for his party in the mid term elections oh everything everything everything to the Gallup the old cliche about this election being the most important one of our lifetimes is really true\nThe Democrats are completely shut out even though they've won the popular vote a lesson in presidential elections and even though they mostly when the popular vote for the house\nIf the Democrats lose this fall and losing means failing to take back the house and make significant gains that the state level there'll be shut out again without a saying legislation judicial appointments or as former Bill Clinton ate a lame Kmart points out in the next congressional redistricting that happens after the twenty twenty cents is\nWinning back some state legislatures or at least getting close is critical for the long term future of the Democrats I mean you know we've had several elections now where there are more democratic votes for democratic members of Congress like Democrats can't win because all the Democrats have been gerrymandered into one district\nSo Democrats have to get control of state legislatures and stop that practice\nIs really is almost should life and death\nThe difference between life and death that's Ron Klain another previously mild mannered Democrat with a currently apocalyptic view of the stakes for his party in November a former top aide in the Clinton and Obama White house is clean says Democrats lose in November their worst nightmare is coming through and Trump has a free hand\nThat means he couldn't fire Jeff Sessions and\nEnd the ... and replace him with a trade journal his choosing means the Trump could continue to roll back regulatory productions undo the Affordable CARE Act\nBut if the Democrats win one house or both claimed says then Congress returns to being a check and balance on the president and there will be a lot of oversight\nYou'll start to see questions being asked about how taxpayer dollars are being wasted how the government is being used as a piggy big for the Trump family you'll see also looks at what's wound up some of

Gallup says Democrats do also planned to legislate\nIf the Democrats take the house and they pass things that people want like an increasing the minimum wage like a child care Bill White controlling prescription drug costs like shoring up pre existing conditions and reducing the cost of premiums ... then what does it take it up or not and then you've got something to run on\nEven if they can't overcome Senate Republicans or a presidential veto the Gallup says Democrats can set an agenda for the next election in twenty twenty\nBut Republicans who've been through this before say be aware of what you wish for Eric Cantor is the former Republican majority leader who came to power when Republicans took over the house after President Obama's first midterm\nThat was thanks to the Tea Party movement which wanted instant results\nI can tell you if we want contemplating Italy monthly if not more often repealing Obamacare\nThan we were not doing all we could even though there was no chance that a bill to repeal Obamacare would pass a Democratic Senate or would be signed into law by President Obama himself\nCanter says Democrats if they went and we'll have to deal with the same danger of super high expectations from their left wing base\nThese constituencies are going to expect abolishing eyes they're going to expect a Democratic majority to implement and execute on Medicare for all and at the most extreme they're going to expect the Democrats who if they win majority in the house to uh go ahead and pay the ...\nIf the Democrats win the house impeachment will quickly become their biggest hot potato they're left wing activist base will demand they moved quickly to impeach the president but the Democrats leadership in Congress is lukewarm at best to that idea\nBut Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment because they know it's a problem they'll only have if they win the majority again Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nYesterday

David Greene in Culver City California\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC we are learning more this morning about what may have happened to the missing Saudi journalist democracy hoagie\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Danville is symbol turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since ... wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll give back to the country Saudi officials continue to deny any involvement in ... disappearance\nWe're joined now by Korean fucking him he is the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with us\n... thanks for having me\nYou're reporting that of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia um why were they trying to get them back and how were they trying to get him back uh\nYeah so as you say the U.S has gathered intelligence that showed\nThat the crown prince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears\nTo confirm that the Saudi leadership is the highest levels was he's a silenced and uh he had written columns in the last year in the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there on the Saudis have said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance even that they were friendly with them and they're not worried about the safety of\nThe intelligence intercepts obviously under cut those assertions and they and they really out to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened\nRight so let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in ... his disappearance at the consulate could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily\nSo allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey I mean\nCertainly those intelligence intercepts of raised ... uh you know ... there's been very little hard evidence\nThat conflict there is that there is this\nTheory that the what happened inside\nMay have been part of a\nTo capture that\nSomehow with US Senators have triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whoever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find out who was actually leading the investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks are that the U.S are they working together\nThe ... you know the the\nEr or leading an investigation um they they are\nA gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they say that they will present their findings um\nWhen the time is right um but you know all of\nThis has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn Jim how about the details of the plot\nThat they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up as this potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in assembled thank you so much thanks\nOkay curry mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy will be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can not believe his\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the\nProgram ...\nSo the president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both\nTo Trump er and er and Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough\nFor Trump personally or to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with is one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at\nUh in in another country um to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um you see what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier\nAre presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkers soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President putting in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans\nWill on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore um look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific um for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict abroad by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate and others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel\nThat he's acting beyond the pale is significant it on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\n\nOn and experts cars can act a conversation with Jacksonville city councilman parents Freeman also the jacks by jak literary arts festival I'm militarized\nGet bogged down with first can

nine to fourteen feet of inundation in some areas and that says that's destructive to end the waves are even on top of that so the combination of the rain but when the storm surge has had every aspect of all the the impacts we expect from a strong hurricane\nRight until you mentioned the storm surge I mean are they are active threats right now to the people who didn't evacuate too who are still in the areas that were hardest hit\nRachel what happens is all that water is forced and because the winds were so strong with the hurricane and you know we were we were talking about this the last three days and how far inland some of that storm surge goes at find every every low spots so rivers that normally flow 'em out to the Gulf like apple after caller river they ...\nActually reverse that war goes back or to go ten Fifteen miles inland so once it's forced and with the wind now it has to flow out and that takes harmful the water levels in a very hard for a little while\nI'm this storm moved quicker than Hurricane Florence any part of the the devastation of that term is that it was so slow moving um but\nThis one it seemed to come on so fast why was that\nIt it's interesting to look at these hurricanes because they're all so different and that's why we try to we spent so much time here at the hurricane center and talking about those impacts because they're all completely different so foreign stalls\nAnd like a Harvey right in Texas and get a horrific when they ... they could bring\nAn amazing amount of rain and flooding dangerous life threatening rain this one's fast so but a different impact with a fast one is you know you start getting some of those hurricane force in what we have a hurricane in southwest Georgia last night which is which is staggering and that causes a lot of damage as well but the other part of this\nEquation is interesting too and you have a Florence\nAnd and you have storms that come across the Atlantic you can see them for five six seven day right when they when this time of your typical for October when they form of the Caribbean there's just not a lot of real estate\nSo one wants to pay for them and they start moving especially with Michael moving you know during the life cycle anywhere from twelve to Fifteen miles an hour to get your quick so those time large change based or were there for them\nYou don't have a lot of time to prepare or not as much as we mentioned the thing is is not over it's been downgraded to a tropical storm but it's headed toward the Carolinas um how much of a threat to the post has said he sold it ...\nYou know look look at the radar here you know we're still have a a strong circulation around it we're still think of this we're still a tropical storm or even after all this time fifty lot are ones around the core\nSo around those rain bands you can definitely still get heavy rain flooding rain\nYou can get tornadoes in the brain bans on the other part that always worries me is you know the falling trees as well because once you start to wake up soil and we're still talking fifty on our Web that'll knock down trees and power lines so yup a dangerous start over people still have to really

from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when he was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see themselves leaving and what the new relationship could be and although

S. so they working together\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are\nGathering evidence from various locations around stumble and uh they said that they will present their findings\nWhen the time is right um but you know all of\nThis has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn about about the details of the five\nDays is covered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held them up as as potentially transformative leader in the middle east [noise]\nGreat for him of the Washington Post a from his bureau in assembled thank you so much thanks\nFor Cory mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy will give us as the president speaking yes\nThis is a bad situation we cannot let this happen\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm the Eurasia Group but we'll come back to the program ...\nSo the president saying that uh he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the us presidents do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mom I've been following the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia\nOr so it it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in\nAnother country to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm you see what he's been saying about the north Korea and\nSupreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkers soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore um look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies caused what brought by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "11"}
