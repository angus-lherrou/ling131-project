correspondent Tamara Keith thanks so much You're welcome\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAll right another chapter opened in a standoff between the state of California and the Trump Administration the California state government is wrangling with the federal government on a whole range of issues including immigration and climate change and now net neutrality\nYou know the Justice Department filed suit this week against a California law new law that regulates Internet service providers that's set up by stakes legal battle who gets to control this question\nCalifornia's law requires carriers to treat all Web traffic equally rather than giving a leg up to some companies over others in other words the law requires them to travel the which was federal policy under the Obama administration but the Obama version of that was ruled back after President Trump took office\nOkay Toni Rom on the Washington Post covers all things like this\nThis is an expert on net neutrality no pressure Tony are going to ask you to explain these issues um again so first off let's talk about this suit why is this a priority for the Justice Department strikes me as sort of an odd thing for them to take an interest in\nYeah the Trump Administration wants the final word on net neutrality here and you have to really rewind the clock to win the FCC killed these open Internet protections that were put in place under former president ... as part of that order the FCC said that states couldn't pass\nTheir own that neutrality rules that explicitly preempted those states from doing so now states that it any way California put his law into place it adopted it I just this past weekend and two hours later the Justice Department filed a lawsuit saying\nIf our decision here it's something that belongs to the federal government and sort of inherent in all of this is a belief that the Internet crosses state lines it would be very difficult in the eyes of the Justice Department to have\nFifty states that have fifty different sets of rules on net neutrality her at the state say we have to do it because the federal government has decided that it's not going to do it\nIs interesting though that the Republican Party has been the party of states' rights in recent generations of loose but here they are pushing for federal power on an issue where this administration has a point of view\nYeah it does seem like a little bit of a twist doesn't it but the ... and says that this is something that has to be controlled by the federal government and once again it's not the only time that the Justice Department has gone after California\nFor taking it one step too far from policies that does the Trump Administration hasn't acted that's why you've seen cases on things like immigration and carbon emissions and so forth so what does this mean\nI mean in the interim can ... does the state law hold can keep doing what it wants to and what are the national implications for the ...\nYeah right now it doesn't mean a whole lot because even if the Justice Department hadn't brought a case this little wouldn't have taken effect until next year\nAnd it isn't even the only piece of litigation that we see right now in ...\nCalifornia is one of about twenty two states that sue the federal government immediately after it procured is repeal is saying that the repeal shouldn't have happened it was arbitrary and capricious in the eyes of the states\nAnd they have the support of tech companies like Facebook and Google as they proceed with that lawsuit so both of these things have to play out the case between the Justice Department in California over what states can do\nAnd the case over whether the repeal should have happened in the first place\nCan I just asked if California were to prevail would they actually supplant the federal government would they control the country because they're just so big they are so influential there the home of Silicon Valley their rules are going to be what the Internet firms would follow everywhere\nYeah that's the potential here that we could see California setting the standard nationally\nAnd this has happened in many other cases it's not just net neutrality California just recently adopted a privacy law for example that controls the ways that companies like Facebook and Google collected monetize information\nThe federal government doesn't have a federal consumer privacy law so what happens there is ultimately going to set the standard for how tech companies or in this case Internet service providers act nationally\nOr Washington Post tax policy reporter Tony ...

I wore a pink shirt to work or I I held my girlfriend's per se while she ran into the bank\nOr I ordered a drink at a restaurant and when it came out to me it had a little cocktail umbrella in it and my you know my friends tease me so it's like it's just mundane things like women don't say oh I wore the wrong shirt\n[noise]\nWhy would men make such a big deal over trivial thing the familiar explanation is massage any are homophobic yeah that's my boss and talked to\nShe began to think about the different messages that boys received from a very young age are you a real man or they say man up Boston built on this inside and conducted a series of research experiments into why men behave the way they do hook inclusion\nMy collaborators then I argue that the male gender role itself it's kind of conceptualize has a more precarious status so manhood is something that hard hit or an easy to lose relative to womanhood\nManhood is something that's hard to earn and easy to many fewer pink shirts and pushes because the defending something fragile in\nOf why this would be the case or why would you have one sex essentially have a more limited repertoire we'll have more policing around us boundaries lie to women\nThat femininity for granted in ways that men did not take them asking it for granted\nThat's really hard question to answer but I think it has to do with um [noise]\nHow men their social status is more hierarchy Akeley organized than women's is\nSo men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status and that kind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status and that translates into a concern about whether once seen as a real man or not\nMen worry about what other men will think what women will think whether themselves from I think Boston has some ideas on how to get more men into nursing she argues that the way to do it is to come up with a new set of stereotypes\nYou could spin nursing as a very masculine occupation it's dangerous to physically grueling our stereotype of the nurse you know you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession\nThat does seem masculine or male appropriate [noise]\nSomething along these lines happened to Robert well on when he was considering whether to become a nurse at twenty three he just finished for years in the navy\nHe wanted to go back to school\nHis wife's dad had a suggestion\nMy father in law who's a respiratory therapist\nSaid hey you know you should really look into nursing\nVon didn't immediately take his father in law's advice\nLike a lot of guys I think the first thing that went through my head was well that's a\nA woman's job but one did get a job at a hospital working as a security guard\nAnd one day something happened that up to and has stereotypes about nursing\nWe had a couple guys who came in to the emergency room and they were just very belligerent fighting there was blood all over the place and the nurses in us and the sheriffs were holding them down and it's a dating and and restraining and all the man is this is pretty cool [laughter] the actions of the nurses were saying was pretty exciting for me\nYou know you think of nursing you think of someone sitting at a [noise]\nA bedside hold your hand and and you see what it is realistically day to day\nFor me it was\nA hundred and eighty

summer\nGovernor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor alike will be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punishes the poor\nTurns out the other stories more complicated now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform say the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports are also\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chase Abou dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or SP ten which abolish is money bail in America's most populous state\nAfter all ... and fellow public service lawyers have long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of a biased system the size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed and I felt betrayed the newest be ten doesn't actually change is a racist system of mass incarceration just expand\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process now under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program\nAs part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nWho didn't believe this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deepen the bill section Thirteen twenty that Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded ... argues it could encompass anyone for any offense that he says will kill the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder sb ... and now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history or under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn ... with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single\nDay the new Dell\nReform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting an arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact to police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse\nOr there's various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan or do you notice that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should also be like they shouldn't people being incarcerated ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative that and they put bail

the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour that is for all fulltime part-time and seasonal workers they're going to start this next month\nTo bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what this change means highly nice good morning and just to note here Amazon is one of NPR's natural supporters solely know what other details\nCan you share right so they should press release and Harriet view takes away from that or take away from that you mentioned that uh the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers\nIs where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically they issued a number of few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars and worse and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand\nTimes on it well I mean I I noticed that you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outlined but just the conditions of workers is is this change a result of of the\nPublic scrutiny well it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um is a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about though the way that uh the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with a if you're counting all the benefits and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base does a CEO Jeff Bass us came to speak in Washington I'm if he weeks ago and I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of Jeff Bass does not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man in history I'm running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money\nAnd they had a little science talking specifically about that I'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become an a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big\nAnd they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking\nTruck fleet of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of um you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere should be scrutinized\nBut the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers in retail and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum\nWage I mean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nBut there is a really big us thing in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working to gain congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage which could be huge if you have one of the\nMost valuable American companies now lobbying for Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge it's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the state have been moving toward this target as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty\nAnd also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars um is is perfectly time for that that creates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of\nPeople who might be looking for employment right during the holiday\nSeason All right great explainer NPR business reporter

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin California is on track to find out just how much control one state can have over giant\nInternet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nThey actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I think that that they uh uh of decided they really want to have a a a an environment where are you know it's it's open for business I guess as their argument and their concern that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh the broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nI'm In about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say\nIs listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and as always delivered locally when you think about it um you know just between it's just that thing in your home and the word ... that's all they care about they're not trying to control everything and so I think that's a what a California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this could set and dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new neutrality laws you know it ... it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically filling gaps the federal government has abandoned the neutrality\nFor reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rules for the whole union you know that when we want there to be no rules for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish and in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word California law on the other hand\nIt's a question of the California ... law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on this\nI mean I I think almost all of them on ... they've all said they they like and that new show the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast or or AT and T. we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans wanting to do\nAll the laws that sort of the uh it's a it's an audience of to the slow the it's the abroad been lobbying though the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised so many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time it's been a pleasure how much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce approve this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American\nAuto worker that as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U. S.\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "02"}
