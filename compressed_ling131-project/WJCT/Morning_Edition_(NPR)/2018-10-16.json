C. dot org\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the Trump Administration announced plans Monday that would require drug makers\nTo reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry Kaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says they advertise needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to have felt so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is\nI'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where um nobody really pays that often ... assays are made a point of saying that the price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing consumers right so if I'm told that my drug at five thousand dollars a month just for example but I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or\nAdoptable covered that are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay it could scary away from getting drug\nRight so um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that is kind of a popular thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the mid term ... um I Want to find out for the November elections so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that a ... price friends' parents and prescription drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you when you start companies to be more a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up just a minute and say in the form it from single industries response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group format and made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to\nUm help educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drugs and they're going to put together a Web portal up that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked hey is there is a possibility for litigation hair and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars\nYesterday um did know that this is just asking for litigation so um\nEven if the world comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tool says the Trump Administration is administration have to enforce that\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame them and then they're going to expect the other companies to each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo real are all those more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you\n[noise] there is no firm indication that the United states will act against Saudi Arabia for the suspected murder of a journalist but the Saudis may already be paying a price NPR's John Ydstie reports on what it means that businesses are backing away\nAnd twenty sixteen crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon Saudi Arabia's affective ruler invited us and global businesses to a conference he unveiled a plan called vision twenty thirty\nHad called for a transition of the Saudi economy away from oil and toward a more diverse market based model and the crown prince invited the companies to participate\nJacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for international economics says the ... affair is undermining the crown princes vision\nNamely that the world's most advanced than competitive companies come and establish themselves in Saudi Arabia\nThat scenario is fading as the CEOs of large us and global companies one after another announced they will not attend the second vision twenty thirty conference scheduled for next week Jamie diamonds C. E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase has said he wanted to end again Jacob Kierkegaard\nI think the fact that as CEO as prominent as you know J. P. Morgan Jamie diamond not going to the summit and saying so publicly and linking it to the ... disappearance means that many other CEOs will probably pull out\nTo other prominent Wall Street CEOs Larry fink of black rock and Steve Schwartzman of the Blackstone group also say they won't be attending\nAccording to the New York times the trio of CEOs tried but failed to get the Saudis to postpone the conference the CEOs also reportedly failed to convince treasury secretary Steven ... to stay home\nThe ... the allegations along with previous behavior of the crown prince are making companies nervous says Kirkegaard\nHe says remember that back in twenty Seventeen the crown prince rounded up four hundred Saudi princes and business people detained them at the Ritz Carlton and re odd on corruption charges and force them to pay the government as much as a hundred billion dollars\nLet your voices be heard joined the conversation on the floor on Fridays at noon on W. J. C. T. [noise]\nClimate change is a fundamental threat to our planet but the president says he still has doubts I'm Joshua Johnson what if anything can be done about that next time on one day\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep prominent authors meet for dinner in London Tonight they learn which of them received the man Booker Prize for fiction those off for the award include Canadian se a do John whose novel is Washington Black\nYou know when you're starting a novel you really playing with character and and you're letting them interact and you're seeing what comes of it and at least for me as a writer I really have no idea where my story has going at the outset of it\nAs her novel starts it seems the narrator is not going anywhere it's the Eighteen thirties and he is a boy and slave on the British controlled island to Barbados he seems likely to be worked to death and sugar cane fields then Washington Black has made an assistant a visiting white male who becomes his friend in a way\nAny true friendship between them is impossible\nBecause of a power imbalance in the relationship it's it's\nJust too great you have to white Englishman teaches Washington Black to read and draw he's revealed to be an almost super naturally talented artist soaking up knowledge that he was denied as a slave the novelist says she doesn't plan for the store to turn out that way\nPart of what I was wanting to explore with this idea of I guess black genius as being something that obviously would have existed back then than you would have people with great gift but that this is something that would have been snuffed out a very brutally in without much thought\nA friend of mine said that you know we tend to think of slavery in terms of the loss of black bodies\nBut you know we don't really stop so much to think about the loss of of uh [noise]\nOf potential of black greatness of black genius\nI have to ask because I'm hearing you saying that you start the novel um don't exactly know where it's going I don't think it's giving away too much to note that\nThis young enslaved man and his older white companion are going to skate Barbados they're going to get out of their uh did you need to get out of there get out of a slave situation as a novelist for your on Saturday\n[noise] it wasn't so much that is that I felt that with this novel what it really wanted to explore was his life post slavery and to show how\n[noise] you know by being physically ... we think of that as being kind of the end of slavery well he's not in chains he's gotten the way he's physically free but I really think that you know there had to be a huge psychological ramifications to having been a slave\nEven while you are free and body that obviously you're carrying with you a great trauma and probably a great sense of the will come into your place in the world that I really wanted to express that\nI'm thinking of two ways that comes across one of the young man is constantly thinking he was going to be recaptured our church tone a another one there's a there's an observation late in the book went on to become apparent that\nIn a way he resents being freed he resents the white man are free to ah obviously if you gave him so many opportunities but also took away from everything that he knew and dislocated up in a way\n[noise] yeah but I also think I think the main thing that he represents is the feeling that the men who freed him did not respect him as an equal and this is really the crux of what what starts to eat\nAnd is that this man made this great gesture of of helping him be free\nAnd yet he really has the sense that this man thought of himself as an illusionist and and your great crusader for good in the world that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of of Washington [noise]\nWhy does this feel like a irrelevant story to you in two thousand and\nI think we're still dealing with a obviously a lot of the themes and concerned that come up in the book [laughter] things like racial injustice racial inequality the idea that some lives are are more worthy than other lines but also this idea of um people\nKind of being galvanized to do something in the world if you think of the abolitionists and um and how they [noise]\nThey really had to\nNot only is sort of changed their own thinking about slavery which would have been just a very sort of ... an everyday thing I mean the sugar arrived on your table\nIn the mornings you put it in your oatmeal you understood that this was the product of slave labor but it was going on in a part of the world that you would probably never and you're like see a you know done by people who you really had nothing in common with\nSo to be able to change their own thinking about that and then to galvanize the whole society to [noise] to change public thinking that this is something huge and an amazing\nSo I was interviewing American voters or the other day in the state of Kentucky and there were a couple of folks and heavily wide areas\nWho brought up black people or a couple of times and expressed baffled by the central I said I don't understand what it is that black people are complaining about I don't see prejudice in my own mind\nAnd that they're saying I don't I just don't get it I don't get this black lives matter thing what would you say to somebody who here's a little bit of the history of the ... out and find that to be old news\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] that's very disheartening to say that but of course I Know I Know that this exists [laughter]\nUm to me that's it's quite shocking because I mean how can one watch say videos of um police officers gunning down unarmed citizens have anybody watch those videos and still contend that there is not a problem and and some\nThat we have racial equality and in fairness that this is baffling to me [noise]\nUh feel that there's been regression that there's been steps backwards in terms of people wanting to understand each other's experience and really being open to it and I think one of the things that novels can do\nIs to bring a reader into the characters experience\nEspecially a character who was nothing like them you know we're dealing here with a boy in Eighteen thirties Barbados a who's a slave but if you can read that and start to see maybe how you are like him a similarities ah and and also\nTo feel for him as he is going through these hardships if you can do that or perhaps that can be the beginnings of some kind of empathy [noise]\nSe or do drugs is the author of Washington Black a novel that's been short listed for the Booker Prize which we find out about today Thanks so much and thank you know\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep

just give us a sense of what you have been seeing over the past few days\nA reporter will really\nSummarize permanently would uh the scene is here just destruction all over the place uh in terms of what the Salvation Army has been doing which was within twenty four hours after the storm cleared out of here on Thursday\nOr they've been meeting the basic need by providing food and and hydration do not only survivors but first responders which is exactly what the Salvation Army does in the initial response of disasters so uh\nThis date right now because the eighty thousand meals have been served a at various locations around the animosity area\nYou were listening in on that conversation with our reporter there Quil Lawrence who said that ... of challenge she\nSaw or people who chose to stay who didn't evacuate and now they're stuck they're stuck in their houses they can't get to a zones that where people can get relief are is the salvation army addressing that or are you are you seeing other organizations try to meet that need\nWell the the nice thing is when it comes to a disaster of the scale one organization alone can can do it and we're very thankful that there are such great other partner agencies a NGOs a local\nAre folks who are who are also picking up a big me up the slack in essence or to try to bring a relief and a basic needs to to those in those areas you know I think there's\nThere's always a group of folks that\nDon't end up leaving they don't heed the call to evacuate or for whatever reason fact I talked to jail and yesterday a who have been in this area for years surviving you know several other hurricanes that have come through general one category choose even a three\nAnd then through you know what we came to that just fine uh I think with the realization was as this thing ramped up coming in and came in almost as a five and they realize too late that they made a huge mistake and they were it was good with their lives but\nYou know that then this is now they've got to be able to eat not able to get water or not just for drinking but to be able to\nPotentially flush the toilet in fact we're all dealing with that including the salvation army personnel better than here in Panama City where we're living with them\nHow does this compare to other hurricane disasters that you've been a part of ...\nSure uh I was here in Florida last year as part of the hurricane Irma relief I was in the sea bring Florida and the issue there was more just widespread power outages didn't see a ton of damage\nOr so the folks actually powers out you can cook you know there's no food to buy so that's where the salvation army comes in and provides that that need that food and hydration but here I I actually came into Tallahassee last Thursday spent a day and a half there\nAnd as I moved west and then further south to come here that's when you saw the tremendous destruction was running along interstate ten west you know you have those swab along the along the highway and\nYou know hundreds and hundreds of them just snapped and have the ones that didn't break were just bend it forty five degrees of I've never seen anything quite like that this is the worst that I've ever seen in terms of the major storm\nJust briefly what are the conversations like how are people holding up\nRemarkably well you wouldn't think uh you know they're they're just happy that we are here and we're happy that they're being able to eat yeah and I'm\nDavid Yarmuth we have to leave it down he spoke to a sense\nThat\nPresident Trump made headlines the other day when he spoke of severe punishment for the suspected murder of a journalist by Saudi Arabia but here's a question when you're listening closely one of the president really say his language showed this was not really a threat he spoke of punishment if\nThe Saudis were responsible and by Monday he leaned into the you know raising doubts about Saudi involvement and blurring the issue NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports this is how the president often handles awkward news\nStanding on the south lawn of the White House President Trump described the conversation he had the Saudi king selmont about what happened to showcase\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe I don't want to get it is by but it sounded to me like they did a big role his ... for for getting to the bottom of it very serious but as long as a flat denial\nIn just twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing and logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's inclined to believe denies something he first did they did not\nFive asset is firmly denies us while he denies that mean Roy Moore denies it\nWay it gives a total denial\nI Will tell you that President boot and was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today\nThat was President Trump referring to the denials of king selmont Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls and Russian President Vladimir Putin's\nDonald Trump is all of us we all do it that I mean I Do that you do that as\nEmily ... is a professor of political science at Syracuse University she says it can be somewhat jarring coming from the president because traditionally American presidents have been more restraint but with Trump the filter as off\nMy sense is that he's relying on some stock phrases that he pulled out again and again especially when he's called on to make a statement about an issue that perhaps they haven't done a lot of research on or doesn't have a lot of information on\nWhich gets to the second thing Trump says regularly when confronted with potentially uncomfortable information or a difficult situation\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be severe punishment a filet is certainly acceptable we want to get to the bottom of everything if Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it and I want to make sure it will never ever happen\nThat with Trump talking about ... disappearance saying he would be open to an FBI investigation into allegations against justice Kavanaugh\nAnd responding to a question about the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the twenty sixteen election which leads to the third thing President Trump's sometimes does offer a theory for instance that wrote killers may have been involved in the show she's disappearance even though it happened in the Saudi conflict\nOr that climate change will just fix itself\nOr that the hacking of democratic campaign emails wasn't done by Russia at all this with Trump and at twenty sixteen presidential debate\nCould also be lots of other people would also could be somebody sitting on the bed did weighs four hundred pounds okay\nThese theories are almost always supported by fact or an verifiable and

Inskeep wire us arms sales to Saudi Arabia such a big deal President Trump brought them up after the Saudi Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to halt us weapons deals over it\nJennifer spin Dell is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us ...\nGood morning thanks for having major ... what does the U.S sell this out as exactly\nSo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia um precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point honestly one thirty transport plane which that American transport planes right so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are pretty inefficient employment mechanism\nPart of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics that means that arms sales aren't and just lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about your finger on actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deal for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs so there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals um amount to and the number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for a important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales to even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and and thinking about the broader political context that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of a show gee is not acceptable that Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and it's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama and August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer of hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel they didn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ...\nSpace Tuesday October

governments in the Eighteen thirties that\nDrew criticism from Chuck Hoskins secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation who joins us now from ... to Oklahoma could warnings or\nGood morning Steve I Walk into the program I just want to note for people who maybe don't follow this everyday remind people that the Cherokee Nation as a sovereign nation it's been around since before the United states and you have people who live within of course the United states how do you determine today who is and isn't Cherokee\nWell first of all we DNA is completely irrelevant to the process but our process is essentially that a a person living today would need to trace back to a turn of the twentieth century senses of Cherokee living in what was to become northeast Oklahoma\nThat's known as the dogs were ... um that role exists a person can trace back to it if you trace back to that and document that proved to things like birth certificates death records\nUh then you can establish yourself as a Cherokee citizen and we now have three hundred and sixty five thousand citizens in the country most of whom live in our territory in northeast Oklahoma and the surrounding area but we have citizens all over the country where the largest traveling the country and we have a very rigorous process uh and it's a about documentation and\nDriving back to that ... genealogy and sent it to people who were legally part of the Cherokee Nation at one time why is DNA irrelevant to that\nWill DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that trace you to native peoples in North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular\nGroup of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind as you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nation we existed before the United states or was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied a in part to federal treaties but this is a legal status a political ad is not a genetic status and that is a very important for folks in this country to understand it was one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what Elizabeth Warren said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people that will say well ah family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test\nOr does it bother you when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a drive but I have Indian ancestry\n[noise] it does I mean first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her a family story\n[noise] um and then we are now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about and so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have very specific\nA means by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political\nA fight or to talk about DNA I really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're a sovereign nation\nWell there's there's a couple of couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific and the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nAre so many of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status it's a legal status that was nearly a extinguished by the government you know states\nIt's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that erodes what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump who's referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should she not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country as people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand our issues [noise]\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there and we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas then\nWell we think that it said Pocahontas first of all was a was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it's at a very dangerous of tone\nA it's a very critical tone I think it's a political back and forth it has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat at so I don't think he does what he ought to do is the president to raise the level of discourse in this country maybe to take the opportunity to to talk about Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWhile this was an opportunity to raise another issue that I think hardly has gotten talked about at all because there's so much news around the country uh there are a lot of Indian nations in this country you have close relations with the federal government dependent on the federal government and and in many ways how has the Trump Administration done for a for the Cherokee Nation last couple\nOf well in in some ways it's been positive we've made a lot of strides in health care um but there's a lot of uncertainty for example in the bureau of Indian affairs and whether the United states is going to consult with us over changes to that agency that's so critical\nIt concerns is at times when there's proposed budget that reduced things that are important to us things to protect the environment that uh go to job creation\nOr education and things of that matter so um we need to we need a federal government that will listen to tribes that will consult with tribes that will live up to its end of the bargain these are treaties these are trust obligations\nAre and so we think the federal government could be doing better but it certainly doesn't help when the president United States attacks US Senator or if a senator gets bogged down in DNA or DNA results\nWell Mr ... thanks very much really appreciate it thanks very much

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the Trump Administration announced plans Monday\nThat would require drug makers\nTo reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry Kaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will let me\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug the costs more than thirty five dollars a month we need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says advertising needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to have ... so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is\nI'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where um nobody really pays that often and ask days are made a point of saying that the price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing consumers right so if I'm told that my drug it's five thousand dollars a month just for example\nBut I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or might adaptable covered that are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay it could scary away from getting a drug\nRight so um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that and it's kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out for the November elections so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that ... price friends' parents had discussion drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you when you start companies to be more a a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nLet me back up to the minute and say in the form it pharmaceutical industry's response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary to\nMeant as well and they said hey we're going to get a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to um help educate you about your price and we will help\nYou know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our garage and they're going to put together a Web portal up that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive\nDuring the press called for that um somebody asked hey is there is a possibility for litigation hair and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did know that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the world comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration as administration how to enforce that\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame them and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo ... more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you\n[noise] there is no firm indication that the United states

administration's approach to trade and other world affairs the other night Leslie stall of CBS sixty minutes asked President Trump about using tariffs on allies\nWell I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships a lot of people but we don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union but why it was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done well\nObama era treasury secretary Jack Lew just co wrote a piece in foreign affairs about using America's economic power thanks for joining us good to be with you today David now in the title of the piece you assert that Washington is no abusing its financial might I mean what are we doing burning bridges\nWell I think that you know first of all a using your economic power is an effective tool is extremely important as a as a ability to project influence it needs to be protected\nOr what the piece argues is that we have to be careful and not treat the use of economic power is if it's limitless\nAnd that if we act too much unilaterally if we violate rules that we helped to design if we don't build an international support for our actions there can be a backlash even if it works in the short term can reduce us influence uh overtime\nYou write about what you call\nSecondary sanctions if I can explain that's a bit when the U.S not only bars its own citizens are are companies from doing business with say Iran but the secondary ones kicking barring Americans from doing business with anyone else that does business\nWith the target nation and you think that's particularly the morning when you drill down to that new level\nWhat I'm arguing what we're arguing in the piece is that it's something that has to be used carefully because if you do it when you're\nIn the case of withdrawing from the Iran deal breaking commitment the United states made in spite of the fact that by all evidence around complied with the nuclear deal\nOr that raises many questions one will the rest of the world cooperate with you into will the country you're sanctioning change its behavior because of the sanctions\nWhich is not say that Iran doesn't do a lot of terrible things uh it's it was a nuclear deal and the secondary sanctions that are going to be re imposing a few days um are being done or not withstanding the fact that all the other signatories to the agreement oppose that action but\nIf you hearken back to an earlier era when perhaps the notion of state craft and respecting these international relationships was more front and center\nThere were some problems with the international trading community we ended up with what many on the left many on the right argue is a broken trading system with China maybe the playing according to the rules and making more nice wasn't working for people\nWe may well have problems with China I spend a lotta time as secretary taking these issues directly to the Chinese but the way to deal with that is by\nMaking the point that you need to have structural changes in China and you need to do with the the moral leadership of having been both the creator of the rules and complying with the rules of international engagement\nI think that the current tariff policy is not an effective way to do it it's hurting us businesses is hurting us jobs and it's making for the world the impression that the United states his disregarding the rules that we helped to write\nJacob Lew was U.S Treasury secretary for twenty Thirteen to twenty Seventeen is now a visiting professor of international and public

for making the time on uh\nDoes he day one of several for you\nAbsolutely thank you Rachel great to be here\nCan you just give us a sense of what you have been seeing over the past few days\nAbsolutely a reporter will really\nSummarize perfectly would uh the scene is here just destruction all over the place uh in terms of what the Salvation Army has been doing which was within twenty four hours after the storm cleared out of here on Thursday\nOr they've been meeting the basic need by providing food and and hydration issue not only survivors but first responders which is exactly what the Salvation Army does in the initial response of disasters so\nOr to this date right now because the eighty thousand meals have been served a at various locations around the animosity area\nYou were listening in on that conversation with our reporter there Quil Lawrence who said that ... of challenge she\nSaw or people who chose to stay who didn't evacuate and now they're stuck they're stuck in their houses they can't get to a zones that where people can get relief are is the salvation army addressing that or are you are you seeing other organizations try to meet that need\nWell the the nice thing is when it comes to a a disaster of the scale one organization alone can can do it and we're very thankful that there are such great other partner agencies a NGOs a local\nUh folks who are who are also picking up a big me up the slack in essence or to try to bring a relief and a basic needs to to those in those areas you know I think there's\nThere's always that group of folks that\nDon't end up leaving they don't heed the call to evacuate or for whatever reason fact I talked to jail and yesterday a who have been in this area for years surviving you know several other hurricanes\nThat have come through general one category choose even a three and then figure you know what we came to that just fine uh I think with the realization was as this thing ramped up coming in and came in almost as a five and they realize too late that they made a huge mistake and they were it was good with their lives but\nYou know that then this is now they've got to be able to eat out to be able to get water or not just for drinking but to be able to\nPotentially flush the toilet in fact we're all dealing with that including the salvation army personnel that are that are here in Panama City we're we're living with them\nHow does this compare to other hurricane disasters that you've been a part of or your team\nShore ah I was here in Florida last year as part of the hurricane Irma relief I was in the sea bring Florida and the issue there was more just widespread power outages didn't see a ton of damage\nOr so the folks obviously powers out you can't cook you know there's no food to buy so that's where the salvation army comes in and provides that that need that food and hydration but here I I actually came into Tallahassee last Thursday spend a day and a half there\nAnd as I moved west and then further south to come here that's when you saw the tremendous destruction was running along interstate ten west you know you have those swat along the along the highway and\nYou know hundreds and hundreds of them just snapped and have the ones that didn't break were just bend at forty five degrees of I've never seen anything quite like that this is the worst that I've ever seen in terms of a major storm\nYeah David Yarmuth we have to leave it there he spoke to us on Skype\nThank you Rachel and\nPresident Trump made headlines the other day when he spoke of severe punishment for the suspected murder of a journalist by Saudi Arabia but here's a question when you're listening closely what is the president really say his language showed this was not really a threat he spoke of punishment if\nThe Saudis were responsible and by Monday he leaned into the you know raising doubts about Saudi involvement and blurring the issue NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports this is how the president often handles awkward news\nStanding on the south lawn of the White House President Trump described a conversation he had the Saudi king selmont about what happened to showcase\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe I don't want to get his days by but it sounded to me like maybe it is a big role jailers bowed out we're going to get to the bottom of it very soon but as long as a flat denial\nIn just twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing and logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's inclined to believe denies something he first did they did not\nFive asset is firmly denies that while he's in I I mean Roy Moore denies it\nWay it gives a total denial\nI Will tell you that President boot and was extremely strong and powerful than his denial today\nThat was President Trump referring to the denials have king Solomon Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls and Russian President Vladimir Putin's\nDonald Trump is all of us we all do it that I mean I Do that you do that as\nEmily ... is a professor of political science at Syracuse University she says it can be somewhat jarring coming from the president because traditionally American presidents have been more restraint but with Trump the filter as off\nMy sense is that he's relying on some stock phrases that he pulled out again and again especially when he's called on to make a statement about an issue that perhaps they haven't done a lot of research on our doesn't have a lot of information on\nWhich gets to the second thing Trump says regularly when confronted with potentially uncomfortable information or a difficult situation\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment a filet is certainly acceptable we want to get to the bottom of everything if Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it and I want to make sure it will never ever happening\nThat was Trump talking about ... disappearance saying he would be open to an FBI investigation into allegations against justice Kavanaugh\nAnd responding to a question about the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the twenty sixteen election which leads to the third thing President Trump's sometimes does offer a theory for instance that wrote killers may have been involved in the show she's disappearance even though it happened in the Saudi conflict\nOr the climate change will just fix itself or that the hacking of democratic campaign emails wasn't done by Russia at all this with Trump and at twenty sixteen presidential debate\nCould also be lots of other people would also could be somebody sitting on the bed didn't waste four hundred pounds okay\nThese theories are almost always supported by fact or an verifiable and conveniently they're often perfectly aligned with what works best for Trump camera Keith\nNews\nThis is NPR News\nAnd you're listening to the devil you Jaycee T Ninety minutes after eight now the

Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep wire us arms sales to Saudi Arabia such a big deal President Trump brought them up after the Saudi Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to halt us weapons deals over it\nJennifer ... is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us come on I\nCan morning thanks for having made of ... what does the U.S sell the Saudis exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia um precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the past\nYou know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point honestly one thirty transport plane which\nThat American transport planes right\nSo it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are up pretty inefficient employment mechanism\nPart of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics that means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deals for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs so there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals I'm about two and a number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for a important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales to even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and and thinking about the broader political context that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of a show gee is not acceptable that Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama in August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer of hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel they didn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ... ah the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nI'm fairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable\nOh because they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer spend del thanks so much thanks for having me she is an expert on weapons transfers and is\nYou've Oklahoma President Trump talks
