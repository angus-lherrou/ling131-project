Boca Raton is with us hey hey Russell\nHow are you Diane how are you good okay go ahead yeah go ahead\nWell while I I I was just going to comment um or maybe I'm stating the obvious but\nThe the crazy divided nature of the of the political environment now psychological environment [noise] it it would support almost any weird conspiracy theory it's just like it could be people on those crazy crazy people on the left\nThat are trying to make the right ... you know trying to influence people think that the way of doing something in this area or vice versa so it could be\nCrazy is on the right trying to you know trying to make make it seem like it's a you know I'm\nBasically to inflame the environment it could be Russia\nA Middle East I mean it's it's really weird but none of these devices exploded so that was either ... or ... but I I Would ... as being in ... the main thing that really really studying is that your virtual violent\nFrom a Republican leader especially from a\nWell he online has made a few comments about it but yeah I mean I I I should also led a folk snow that vice president Mike Pence was in Jacksonville yesterday to campaign on behalf of gubernatorial candidate Rhonda San is\nAnd while he was here he uh you know condemned uh these acts of terrorism and called for a a a robust investigation but but Russell I I appreciate what you're saying now let me ask you one more question you think do you using these devices didn't explode intentionally\nSo by that and do you think these were done as a way to sort of metal in our politics\nWell yeah I mean it's actually going that I my my mind's even goes in that direction yeah\nIt's really symptomatic of what's going on here you know I\nI Am highly educated you know professor [noise] I don't I don't like waking me is that I find myself going on these these are the speculation but just a matter of what's loving the minds of knowing people\nIs the what's going on you know it's either as mentioned goals they didn't explode or conflict and loads of them look but you know\nAnd I take your point I I think people because of where political climate is I think you're right that many Americans are speculating in all kinds of ways and I I appreciate you sharing your thoughts about that [noise] uh no that's wrestling that's Russell in Boca Raton\nWe will have to wait David as you said to just learn more from the authorities they're going to be giving a news conference in South Florida later on this afternoon meanwhile lots of calls here on the floor to round up methods in Jacksonville ... go ahead\n\nHi Beth are you with us yes can you tell me [noise] yes go ahead bath yes I'm I'm not quite and leave\nSure that their tribe actually had started off if and if you have been to the ah that the tribes a casino in in Hollywood that is their signature hard rock um location managed big and it's beautiful and right now they're building this thirty story guitar shaped a hotel tower um it's amazing\nUm they actually started across the street who's a bingo hall I Believe it was in Nineteen eighty or Nineteen Seventy nine to the to December Seventy nine or ... or early eighties um it was just a bingo hall and they slowly grew this and they started picking up revenue obviously in Miami\nI'm you know have you have you have your retirement population so they got a lot of people that want it to a you know pass the time and enjoy themselves\nAnd that slowly and generally had built up as they are you know gather more patrons and also kind of had some back and forth with the legislature and apparently Charles\nSo and now you have today is huge yeah mhm\n[noise] okay and it's a thrill five nine nine five Eighteen hundred as we talked gambling and dog racing on the floor to round up you voter well make some decisions about that on your November ballot we want your questions and comments you can tweet the show as well at Florida round up\nWell this is a high dollar fight then over the seminal tribe or against the para mutual and ... out of state betting operators\n... is this is this just a a backdoor way for the existing gambling concerns to sort of protect their interest is that a fair way to describe this or not\nI wouldn't think so I think this is actually this is actually a remarkable move by the by the ... tribe or which obviously has been feuding with the mutual for for at least the past you know I think since they're they're they signed a contract with the legislature in two thousand times\nUm the the tribe a obviously which has done very well for themselves and arch all the ... the the uh the medicine me I'm Sorry ... who's I'm at a at a at an event that I was with the tribe in July and he had said\nUm we were you know we were we came from the swamps um you know we had to do with all the strikes that was you know here we had to get lost her young um and now we're standing here in front of this beautiful hotel tower guitars to shape tower here for all of you with the tribe wants consistency the tribe wants to know that their futures being protected so\nThey they want to make sure that the para mutual can't grow anymore I'm so and then with the mutual they see opportunity strict grow but they don't exactly involve the traditional ... during which are the tracks are seeing a decrease in revenue from the tracks whether they be greyhound's or where are our thoroughbreds\nAh they they want to be casinos too um but then you hear in the fight over\nYou know who gets to do what the tribe you know the legislature with the compact that they signed\nThe legislature said to the ... we're going to allow you to have exclusivity on casinos style games which are the the black checks the relapse slot machines [noise]\nUm but then the mutual is already a heck they grandfathers are eight eight to eight of the casinos in a Broward Miami Dade to a lot they have them for them to have slot machines for the rest of the state to not have them so that the drive has this whole but again there's always been that fight 'em that apparently just wants to grow and it probably doesn't want it [noise]\nUm so here we have it this is you know this amendment is basically the tribes saying this this this is sort of big wind isn't a Hail Mary this is an basically charging down the field as fast as I can\nAnd says that they can and if you're just tuning in lots of a ballot amendments will be a there when you go to vote in November sakes if you haven't already voted early one of them is amendments three and it has to do with the gambling in Florida\nIn a moment we'll talk about amendments search team which is closely related now that has to do with dog racing in Florida that's an even more intense emotional fight in some respects because it involves animals are amendment three need sixty percent of voters to pass\nLike all of the amendments and it would require state wide approval of casinos style games like slot machines and the future so what do you think about that give us a call on the floor to round up three of five nine nine five Eighteen hundred Paul isn't Miramar hello Paul how are you go ahead\nMike horses just about the way they write or voters what I Want to go vote there was a little bit more information about these amendments but why is that word it one way like\nI I Know Paul it's so true there are a there are so many amendments and be they are very confusing Lee worded and I appreciate you pointing that out Eric's are key Sam with political Florida I yeah you almost gotta wonder do they are they doing this on purpose ticket [laughter]\nUses them just hoping that they passed because people not even sure what they're voting for that's the cynic in may but he's right I mean these amendments are complex they're confusing Lee worded there's a ton of them\n... only the most committed voters are going to really do their homework on these amendment so what about that well\nOne of the actually not to jump the gun on a minute Thirteen but obviously that amendment was challenged in uh in Leon county circuit court in a one of the one of the they ... they were to do with the the language of the amendment was was misleading in the in the in the title didn't match the actual language and\nThe argument that I Believe that the er at the state has look we only had Seventy five words there's no there's only so much room on the ballot\n'em to explain these amendments and that's where they it somewhat of an expectation that people would want to read up on it um and that's where you know people would go to you know read newspapers and what not but I Do agree with you even when I read I I have my my sample ballot that I got from all the un county supervisor of elections\nAnd that that doesn't tell you it doesn't tell you nearly as much as you know what I Would know about it so I I almost cringe when I read it because it doesn't seem much and it is somewhat vague and just ... I kind of mentioned that the tribe is going to be you know is a is not going to be affected by the amendment it doesn't tell everyone at you know everything so that's where I'm you know\nThat's where I obviously I go straight to the amendment itself but for you know for folks out there to pick up a can pick up a newspaper or a you know try and try and read up on it\nA lot so called says we talk about these amendments three and Thirteen now amendments Thirteen as the other gambling amendment that you vote or will be asked to vote up or down on election day it proposes a ban on wage ring on dog races and as we talk about that amendment\nOr with Eric Sarkozy in a political Florida we want to hear your calls because a greyhound racing in Florida it's actually a in a minority of states as even still dealing greyhound racing and we have a lot of calls about that let's go to Kelsey and ... now Hi Kelsey you're on\nThe air and a lot of worried about\nAnimals or they're not [laughter]\n... yeah a thank you for that question ah what does happen to the dogs I Know a lot of them are injured when they stop racing Eric isn't that right which is leading to some of the controversy around this\nThat's why I mean dogs do get injured on an obviously and unfortunately dogs also also die of ... I actually toward a or one of the greyhound or the tracking Sanford was the San Fernando kennel club\nAnd are actually touring one of the tunnels I'm ... I they they showed one dog that was actually you know do you know happy and and you know getting up and wanted to jump on me and they said well this dog\nThis dogs are retiring it's going to a family in Tennessee I was like a news retiring this was only like a year old is it oh it doesn't feel like racing anymore\nAnd I got confused like that it just doesn't feel like it or they can't just on my boss I don't feel like working you know they say they say well once the dog doesn't feel like actually you know it doesn't have the ... but I think they said it doesn't have the chase in it\nThey they take the dog often and the butter for adoption is that the folks I talked to in San Fernando where they pointed themselves at these dogs were going to adoption agencies I think they said it was a Ninety six percent rate of dogs that were actually getting adopted and they're there they were very protective of that and if and if one of her shows up in a shelter that they'll pull it out and make sure it gets adopted\n'em to the da da da da da da da da da and left you know left to fend for themselves or the wall or something [noise] so um yeah it's it it didn't seem nearly as a stroke a stressful as a as a first thought\nYeah and uh I Do know in some at some tracts dogs or had been\nHad been given drugs uh it's certainly a controversial topic as we speak with Eric ... political Florida about these gambling amendments one involving casino gambling one involving dog racing\nAnd if you're just tuning into the Florida run if we're just trying to educate all of the voters out there about what these amendments would do a and we want to know what voters and colors out there or think\nAbout dog tracks in Florida you know Florida is one of a a minority only a handful of states that is still doing dog racing and due to a cork in the law the dog racing and the the gambling facilities are intertwined we're going to talk a little bit more about that on the show\nAs well and take your calls as we continue talking election stuff here on the floor to round up from Florida public radio\n\nOkay let's go to Cathy in Britain to now Hi Cathy go ahead\nHi I'm a dog you know let a terrible like Eric they live in cases they are not taken out by um I talked to people who have I got it down I have friends that have got it then I have friends that work and all that where the\n... how many after the ... racing and the dogs are not in good shape and take God out of the right now we need to stop using it got mad at at a ...
